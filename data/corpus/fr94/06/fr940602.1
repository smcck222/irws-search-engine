SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations, known as the Import Regulations, promulgated by the Department of Agriculture and codified at 7 CFR
6.20&hyph;6.34 provide for the issuance of licenses to importers of certain dairy products which are subject to quotas
proclaimed by the President pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended (7 U.S.C.
624). Those dairy products covered by the Import Regulation may only be entered into the United States by or for the
account of a person or firm to whom such license has been issued and only in accordance with the terms and conditions
of such license, the Import Regulation, and the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Import licenses are issued on a calendar year basis and each license authorizes the license holder to import a specified
quantity and type of dairy product from a specified country. The utilization of licenses by the license holders, and
entries made under such licenses are carefully monitored by the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Customs Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule changes of a technical nature being considered by the Department include modifications, revisions, and updating
with respect to: Definitions; eligibility requirements; transfer of eligibility; allocation of annual quotas
and issuance of licenses; issuance of ex-quota permits; sales-in-transit; records and inspection; and suspension
and revocation procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 15, 1994, the United States concluded the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations and entered into
agreements which provide for increased market access opportunities for most products, including dairy products.
The Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture necessitates the development of new rules to implement commitments undertaken
including those pertaining to: Tariffication and modification of existing import quotas to permit additional entry
of dairy products; consolidation of certain existing dairy quota products as provided for in the Agreement; and methods
of administering and allocating the new tariff-rate quota system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Interested persons are encouraged to submit their comments, views, and suggestions on forthcoming proposed changes
as well as any other comments that they may feel appropriate.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA-financed cooperatives are generally organized on a two-tier system with power supply borrowers providing wholesale
service to their member/owners, the distribution cooperatives. The power supply borrower owns or controls generation
and bulk transmission facilities. The distribution members own the facilities necessary to serve consumers on the
retail level. Taken together, a power supply borrower and its distribution members are essentially one economic
unit, similar to a typical investor-owned utility which owns or controls both the sources of production and the retail
franchises. This unity of ownership and interest between the power supply cooperative and its owners has made possible
a highly efficient capitalization structure uniquely suited to the needs of REA's constituency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Distribution cooperatives entered into long term contracts to purchase all their power requirements from the power
supply cooperative at the rates necessary to cover all the power supplier's costs, including debt service on its loans.
These contracts, together with all other assets of the power supply cooperative, are pledged as security for billions
of dollars of loans to the power supply cooperatives by the Government and private sector alike. The Government and
other lenders have generally not required power suppliers to develop and maintain equity. As a result, consumers
benefitted from lower electric rates, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While, in most cases, REA credit support requirements currently include the long term, all-requirements wholesale
power contract and the first lien on all property including after acquired property, in several instances REA has
required additional credit support in the form of guarantees from the G&amp;T's members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA is undertaking to review the requirement for credit support in connection with G&amp;T loans and loan guarantees.
REA will be taking into consideration the G&amp;T profile and the projects undertaken by the G&amp;T. This profile
includes some of the following characteristics: 100% debt financing from REA; equity considerations; and complex
issues concerning their wholesale power contract agreements. REA financing of G&amp;T projects generally consists
of primarily guarantees of FFB loans and lien accommodations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Credit Support Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA is requesting input on all factors that impact on the feasibility and risks associated with the borrower and the
project to be financed. Factors to be considered may include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The regulatory climate (degree of regulation, regulatory body policies); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Economics of the service territory (consumer growth trends, consumer load diversity, revenue by consumer class),;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The power supply borrowers' current and future electric resource arrangement (capacity, fuel agreements, purchased
power, generation statistics); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Construction and operating risk of the proposed facility; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Quality of management (strategic planning, consumer relations, experience, depth, capability, credibility,
response to changing environment); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Whether the borrower is operating under a debt restructure agreement with REA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Impact on distribution member cooperative rates; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Rate competitiveness; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i Territorial integrity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Diversification activity and/or plans: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. Analysis of accounting practices vs. industry practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically requested on what factors should be considered, how the factors should be weighted, i.e.
the ranking criteria, and on when REA should generally not require additional credit support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA anticipates reserving the right to require credit support on any loan or loan guarantee it deems necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Types of Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
REA is also requesting input on the forms of credit support REA should require under those circumstances where additional
credit support is required. Respondents should consider, among others, in addition to the lien on wholesale power
contracts and all system assets, the following types of support: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. G&amp;T member guarantees of loans made to a G&amp;T; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Guarantees by financial institutions of G&amp;T loans in lieu of member guarantees; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Letters of Credit obtained by members in lieu of a guarantee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
REA is also requesting comments and suggestions on the terms and conditions that would attach to such credit support.
Comments are specifically requested on the concepts of joint and several liability of guarantors, liability caps,
pro rata sharing of liability, acceleration of the support obligations under certain circumstances, collateralization,
term, and termination.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) directs that, ``[T]he Secretary [of the Department of
Energy (DOE)] shall establish a demonstration program in cooperation with the private sector, for the dry storage
of spent nuclear fuel at civilian power reactor sites, with the objective of establishing one or more technologies
that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors
without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional site-specific approvals by the NRC.'' Section
133 of the NWPA states, in part, that ``the Commission shall, by rule, establish procedures for the licensing of any
technology approved by the Commission under Section 218(a) for use at the site of any civilian nuclear power reactor.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To implement this mandate, the Commission approved dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in NRC-approved casks, publishing
a final rule on 10 CFR Part 72 entitled ``General License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites'' (55 FR 29181).
This rule also established a new subpart L within 10 CFR part 72 entitled ``Approval of Spent Fuel Storage Casks,''
containing procedures and criteria for obtaining NRC approval of dry storage cask designs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 rulemaking listed four casks in &sect;72.214 of subpart K as approved by the NRC for storage of spent fuel at
power reactor sites under general license by persons authorized to possess or operate nuclear power reactors. Since
then, two more casks have been listed in &sect;72.214, one on April 7, 1993 (58 FR 17948) and another on October 5, 1993
(58 FR 51762).

This proposed rulemaking would add the Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular Storage System to the list of NRC approved
casks for spent fuel storage in &sect;72.214. Following the procedures specified in &sect;72.230 of Subpart L, VECTRA
Technologies, Inc. (formerly Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (PNFSI))
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 submitted an application for NRC approval, together with a ``Safety Analysis Report for the Standardized NUHOMS
Horizontal Modular Storage System for Irradiated Nuclear Fuel'' (SAR), NUH&hyph;003, Revision 2, dated November
1993. The NRC evaluated VECTRA's submittal and issued a draft Safety Evaluation Report (SER) on VECTRA'S SAR and a
draft certificate of compliance for the Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular Storage System. On January 24, 1994,
Pacific Nuclear Systems, Inc., (parent company of PNSFI) changed its name to VECTRA Technologies, Inc., after it
acquired ABB Impell Corporation.

The NRC is proposing to approve VECTRA's Standardized NUHOMS Modular Storage System for Irradiated Nuclear Fuel,
for storage of spent fuel under the conditions specified in the draft certificate of compliance. This cask, when used
in accordance with the conditions specified in the certificate of compliance and NRC regulations, will meet the requirements
of 10 CFR Part 72; thus, adequate protection of the public health and safety would be ensured. This cask is being proposed
for listing under &sect;72.214, ``List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks'' to allow holders of power reactor operating
licensees to store spent fuel in this cask under a general license. The certificate of compliance would terminate
20 years after the effective date of the final rule listing the cask in &sect;72.214, unless the cask's certificate
of compliance is renewed. The certificate contains conditions for use which are similar to those for other NRC approved
casks, however, the certificate of compliance for each cask may differ in some specifics_such as, certificate number,
operating procedures, training exercises, spent fuel specification. The draft certificate of compliance for the
Standardized NUHOMS cask and the underlying draft SER, are available for inspection and comment at the NRC Public
Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the proposed certificate of compliance
may be obtained from Mr. K. C. Leu, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 504&hyph;2685.

Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the NRC regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part
51, the NRC has determined that this rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment, and therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required. The rule
is mainly administrative in nature. It would not change safety requirements and would not have significant environmental
impacts. The proposed rule would add one cask known as the Standardized NUHOMS Modular Storage System to the list of
approved spent fuel storage casks that power reactor licensees can use to store spent fuel at reactor sites without
additional site-specific approvals by the NRC. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact
on which this determination is based are available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW.
(Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact
are available from Mr. G. Gundersen, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, Telephone (301) 492&hyph;3803.

Regulatory Analysis

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181), the Commission issued an amendment to 10 CFR Part 72. The amendment provided for the storage
of spent nuclear fuel under a general license. Any nuclear power reactor licensee can use these casks if (1) they notify
the NRC in advance, (2) the spent fuel is stored under the conditions specified in the cask's certificate of compliance,
and (3) the conditions of the general license are met. In that rulemaking, four spent fuel storage casks were approved
for use at reactor sites, and were listed in 10 CFR 72.214. That rulemaking envisioned that storage casks certified
in the future could be routinely added to the listing in &sect;72.214 through rulemaking procedures. Procedures
and criteria for obtaining NRC approval of new spent fuel storage cask designs were provided in 10 CFR 72.230. Subsequently,
two additional casks were added to the listing in &sect;72.214 in 1993.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The alternative to this proposed action is to withhold certification of this new design and give a site-specific license
to each utility that proposed to use the cask. This alternative however, would cost the NRC more time and money for each
site-specific review. In addition, withholding certification would ignore the procedures and criteria currently
in place for the addition of new cask designs. Further, it is in conflict with NWPA direction to the Commission to approve
technologies for the use of spent fuel storage at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors without, to the extent
practicable, the need for additional site reviews. Also, this alternative is anticompetitive in that it would exclude
new vendors without cause and would arbitrarily limit the choice of cask designs available to power reactor licensees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of the proposed rulemaking would eliminate the above problems. Further, the proposed rule will have no adverse
effect on the public health and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefit of this proposed rule to nuclear power reactor licensees is to make available a greater choice of spent
fuel storage cask designs which can be used under a general license. However, the newer cask design may have a market
advantage over the existing designs in that power reactor licensees may prefer to use the newer casks with improved
features. The new cask vendors with casks to be listed in &sect;72.214 benefit by having to obtain NRC certificates
only once for a design which can then be used by more than one power reactor licensee. Vendors with cask designs already
listed may be adversely impacted in that power reactor licensees may choose a newly listed design over an existing
one. However, the NRC is required by its regulations and NWPA direction to certify and list approved casks. The NRC
also benefits because it will need to certify a cask design only once for use by multiple licensees. Casks approved
through rulemaking are to be suitable for use under a range of environmental conditions sufficiently broad to encompass
multiple nuclear power plants in the United States without the need for farther site-specific approval by NRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rulemaking has no significant identifiable impact or benefit on other Government agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above discussion of the benefits and impacts of the alternatives, the NRC concludes that the requirements
of the proposed rule are commensurate with the Commission's responsibilities for public health and safety and the
common defense and security. No other available alternative is believed to be as satisfactory, and thus, this action
is recommended.

Regulatory Flexibility Certification

In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this
rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This
proposed rule affects only the licensing and operation of nuclear power plants and cask vendors. The companies that
own these plants do not fall within the scope of the definition of ``small entities'' set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility
Act or the Small Business Size Standards set out in regulations issued by the Small Business Administration at 13 CFR
part 121.

The NRC has determined that the backfit rule (10 CFR 50.109 or 10 CFR 72.62) does not apply to this proposed rule, and
thus, a backfit analysis is not required for this proposed rule because this amendment does not involve any provisions
which would impose backfits as defined in the backfit rule.

The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class E airspace
at Nashville International Airport, Tennessee. Runways 2C and 20C have been extended. The Class E airspace extending
upward from 700 feet above the surface is proposed to be extended from a 10-mile radius to a 15-mile radius of the Nashville
International Airport to contain IFR operations within controlled airspace for these runways. The coordinates
for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designations of Class E airspace extending upward from
700 feet or more above the surface are published on Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in CFR 71.1 effective September 16, 1993. The Class E airspace
designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter than will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would amend the Hoquiam, Washington, Class E airspace. The action would provide controlled airspace
for a new instrument approach procedure at the Hoquiam, Bowerman Airport, Hoquiam, Washington. Airspace reclassification,
in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing it with the
designation ``Class E airspace.'' The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide reference for pilots.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is publishing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on the issue of the
appropriateness of requested single location bargaining units in representation cases. This rule would be applicable
only in cases involving initial organizing in the retail, manufacturing and trucking industries. The Board is publishing
this advance notice to seek timely comments and suggestions from the public, labor organizations, employer groups,
and other interested organizations on how the Board may best fulfill its statutory obligation to determine an appropriate
unit when a single location bargaining unit is sought in these particular industries.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The question of the appropriateness of a single location bargaining unit when requested by a labor organization has
been an issue in NLRB representation proceedings for almost 60 years. See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Atlantic Refining Co.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 1 NLRB 359, 364&hyph;5 (1936). In the vast majority of cases, the single location unit is found appropriate, but only
after extensive litigation of such factors as geographical separation, similarity of employee skills and terms
and conditions of employment, autonomy of the location manager, extent of employee interchange, contact between
facilities, functional integration, and other miscellaneous matters. The years of litigation have not been enlightening.
A presumption of separate appropriateness has evolved in most industries when the unit petitioned for is single facility
in scope. See, e.g., Sav-On Drugs, Inc., 138 NLRB 1032, 1033 (1962); and Haag Drug Co., 169 NLRB 877 (1968).
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 One court spent nine pages reciting the facts in two separate cases, involving two separate industries, reaching
opposite results in the cases despite combining them for purposes of decision.

 567 F.2d 331 (7th Cir. 1977). (In the course of its opinion, the court noted that the Board's approach in this area has
``fluctuated'' (pages 335&hyph;336, fn. 7). We believe it is time to strive for more certainty and less litigation
and delay on this issue, and invite comments on how best to do this in the retail, manufacturing and trucking industries.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The presumption does not apply when the unit petitioned for is multi-facility in scope. See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
Capital Coors Co., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many different industries have been involved in litigation of this issue, but large groups of cases have centered
on the retail, manufacturing and trucking industries. See e.g., Red Lobster, 300 NLRB 908 1990 (retail); J&amp;L
Plate, 310 NLRB 429 (1993) (manufacturing); and Bowie Hall Trucking 290 NLRB 41 (1988) (trucking). Although this
issue is litigated in other industries, cases involving these other industries fall outside the scope of the Board's
concern in this proceeding. With regard to retail, manufacturing and trucking, however, the factors considered
by the Board in these cases, including the presumptive appropriateness of a separate facility, appear to us to be well-established.
The Board's decisions in these industries are reasonably predictable; with certain limited exceptions, the single-facility
unit usually is found appropriate. We believe, that in normal circumstances, it is no longer necessary for the Board
and the parties involved to expend extensive resources litigating the issue. Hence, the Board seeks to promulgate
a rule or rules to limit to the extent possible the necessity to adjudicate the appropriateness of petitioned-for
single facility units in these three industries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One possibility would be for the Board to promulgate a rule or several rules which are specifically tailored to these
particular industries.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 It is possible, though not certain, that the issue of separate appropriateness when raised in different industries
may present different considerations. For example, a rule which finds a single facility appropriate, in part, because
of a defined insubstantial amount of interchange among locations may differ between the trucking industry and the
retail industry because of the differing nature of the duties of the employees in the two industries, including their
itinerant as opposed to stationary work stations, respectively.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
It is not the Board's present intention to promulgate rules for any particular sub-categories or sub-industries
within the retail, manufacturing or trucking industries. The Board's intention is to promulgate a rule or rules with
the broadest applicability possible within these three generic categories of industries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another possibility would be to promulgate a single rule applicable across all three industries, deeming appropriateness
to be determined by reference to several specified factors. For example, a rule could be promulgated which would declare
appropriate any separate facility unit requested where (a) A given number of employees_for example, 15_were employed,
or (b) no other facility of the employer was located within a specified distance_for example, one mile_and where,
in addition, a supervisor within the meaning of the Act, located at the site, oversaw operation of the facility requested.
Extraordinary circumstances would render the rule inapplicable. One such extraordinary circumstance might be
where a set percentage (e.g., at least 10 percent) of the employees in the unit sought performed work at other locations
a certain percentage (e.g., at least 10 percent) of the time (frequently referred to as temporary interchange.) Because
they have seldom made a difference in prior Board decisions, permanent interchange would no longer be deemed relevant;
nor would centralization of personnel functions, functional integration, or contact between employees at the facilities.
If extraordinary circumstances were present, or if the rule were for other reasons inapplicable, the issue would
be decided by adjudication, under published precedent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule or rules also may address the definitional question of what constitutes a single facility. See, e.g., Child's
Hospital, 307 NLRB 90 (1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous other possibilities present themselves on these subjects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the fact that the Board has made no decision on the propriety of any form of rulemaking in this area, we invite all
interested parties to comment on (a) The wisdom of promulgating a rule or rules on this issue in the three specified
industries, and (b) the appropriate content of such a rule or rules.

Statement of Member Stephens and Member Cohen
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule declaring the presumptive appropriateness of a single facility bargaining unit has had a long and somewhat
stable history, unlike the Board's turbulent experience with health care unit determinations that prompted our
rulemaking on that subject in 1987. Nevertheless, given the prevailing view of our colleagues that the single facility
presumption should be reexamined and perhaps strengthened, we have no objection to considering the matter in the
context of informal rulemaking. Unlike case adjudication, an advance notice proceeding such as this will enable
the Board to solicit comments from a broad cross-section of interested persons before making a final decision on the
relevant issues, including whether rulemaking is at all warranted, whether (and how) the substantive law defining
the pertinent factors that can rebut the presumption should be changed, and whether indeed extensive (and perhaps
unnecessary) resources are being expended litigating this unit question. Until the appropriate administrative
record is compiled, we join our colleagues in deferring a final decision on any of these questions.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) which concern the control
of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from pleasure craft coating operations and set general recordkeeping
requirements for VOC emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements
of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR)
will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules and is proposing
to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary
ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rules being proposed for approval into the California SIP are: South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD)
Rule 1106.1, Pleasure Craft Coating Operations and Rule 109, Recordkeeping for Volatile Organic Compound Emissions.
These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on September 14, 1992.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin. 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305.
Because this area was unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under
section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40 CFR 52.238. On May
26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that
the SCAQMD's portion of the California SIP was inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested
that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 were enacted. Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended section
182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient
reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states
to submit corrections of those deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified
as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended
section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Los
Angeles-South Coast Air Basin is classified as extreme;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 therefore, this area was subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline.

The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on September 14, 1992, including
the rules being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for SCAQMD Rule 1106.1, Pleasure
Craft Coating Operations, and for SCAQMD Rule 109, Recordkeeping for Volatile Organic Compound Emissions. SCAQMD
adopted Rule 1106.1 on May 1, 1992 and Rule 109 on March 6, 1992. These submitted rules were found to be complete on November
20, 1992 pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR Part 51 Appendix V

 EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the
CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 1106.1 requires the use of low VOC coatings for marine pleasure craft coating operations and coating application
methods with high transfer efficiencies, and Rule 109 sets out general recordkeeping requirements for regulating
volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions for a variety of source categories. VOCs contribute to the production
of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted as part of the district's efforts to achieve the National Ambient
Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement.
The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of
the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the
basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions
is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources
of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique
Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive
norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents,
as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). Rule
1106.1 controls emissions from a source category for which EPA has not issued a CTG and Rule 109 is a general recordkeeping
rule and therefore does not have a corresponding CTG. Further interpretations of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book,
referred to in footnote 1. In general, these guidance documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully
enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SCAQMD's submitted Rule 109, includes the following significant changes from the current SIP: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Adds a definition for Exempt Compounds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Removes Executive Officer Discretion from sections (c)(2) and (c)(3) as prescribed in the Technical Support
Document (TSD) (dated January 15, 1992), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Adds EPA-approved test methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SCAQMD Rule 1106.1 is a new rule which was adopted to regulate emissions for the coating of marine pleasure craft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and
EPA policy. Therefore, SCAQMD Rule 1106.1 and Rule 109 are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of
the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and Part D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

Regulatory Process

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule
on small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a
substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature
of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action.
The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the
requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules
on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order

I. July 27, 1990 Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 27, 1990 EPA proposed a comprehensive rule (Subpart S) specifying corrective action requirements for facilities
regulated under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (55 FR 30798). The proposed rule was
developed to replace the existing Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) rules with a detailed regulatory program
for implementing corrective action. A Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) to estimate the costs and benefits of the
Subpart S proposed rule was developed to support the proposed rule. In that proposal, the EPA explained that it would
continue to refine its estimates. As indicated in that proposal, the EPA is making available this revised draft RIA,
and the Agency will take public comments, as well as comments received from EPA's Science Advisory Board (November
1993) into account in making its decision on how to proceed with the final Subpart S rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Subpart S RIA includes supporting data regarding studies conducted by EPA concerning the use of CAMUs in RCRA
corrective actions. EPA used these supporting data in a recent rulemaking authorizing the establishment of CAMUs
(58 FR 8658, February 16, 1993). Although the CAMU rulemaking included a separate RIA and a summary report, some commenters
requested additional information on the data supporting that analysis. EPA believes the summary report provided
sufficient detail for purposes of the CAMU rulemaking; however, because the results of the CAMU RIA will be important
for regulatory options analysis in the final Subpart S RIA, a more detailed breakdown of the CAMU data is included in
this first installation of data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the data made available through this notice may be relevant to a related RCRA rulemaking initiative,
known as the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR) for contaminated media, which is intended to result in amended
RCRA rules for the management of contaminated media. Comments on the data made available in today's notice may assist
the Agency in assessing how the CAMU rule may relate to this new rulemaking initiative.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency proposes to make determinations of base flood elevations and modified base
flood elevations for each community listed below, in accordance with Section 110 of the Flood Disaster Protection
Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed base flood and modified base flood elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria
required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must
change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community
may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State,
or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP
and are also used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations
are made final, and for the contents in these buildings.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) listed the coastal California gnatcatcher (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Polioptila californica californica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) as a threatened species on March 25, 1993. On May 2, 1994, this listing was invalidated by the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia on the basis that the Secretary of the Interior failed to obtain and make available
for public review and comment the data underlying a published scientific report on the subspecific taxonomy of the
California gnatcatcher. In response to the court's decision the author of that report has provided these data to the
Service. The Service if seeking public comment on these data.

gnatcatcher the Service relied, in part, on taxonomic studies conducted by Dr. Jonathan Atwood of the Manomet Bird
Observatory, Manomet, Massachusetts. As is standard practice in the scientific community, the Service did not request,
nor was it offered, the data used by Dr. Atwood in reaching his conclusions. Instead, the Service relied upon the conclusions
published in Dr. Atwood's peer reviewed scientific report on the subspecific taxonomy of the California gnatcatcher
(Atwood 1991). This report was used by the Secretary to support, in part, a finding that the southern range limit of
the coastal California gnatcatcher occurs at 30 degrees north latitude in Baja California, Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Building Industry Association of Southern California (BIA) and others filed suit in Federal court challenging
the listing on several grounds, including the claim that the Service was legally required to obtain and make Atwood's
data available for review and comment. On May 2, 1994, the court ruled in favor of the BIA and vacated the listing. In
response to the court's decision, Dr. Atwood has agreed to release his data to the Service. With this notice, the Service
makes available for public review and comment Dr. Atwood's data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's decision and, alternatively, a motion to stay
the portion of the decision that vacated the listing while the Service receives public comment on these data. These
motions are currently pending before the court. The Service is also reviewing several other options to provide the
protection of the Endangered Species Act to the gnatcatcher. These options include appealing the court's decision,
listing the gnatcatcher on an emergency basis, and proposing a new rule to list the gnatcatcher.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service solicits public comments on Dr. Atwood's data in order to assist it in further evaluating the decision
to list the coastal California gnatcatcher pursuant to the Endangered Species Act.

SUMMARY
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposes to revise its Safety and Health Regulations
for Longshoring and, to a far lesser extent, to amend its Safety and Health Regulations for Marine Terminals. The proposed
rule covers cargo handling and related activities conducted aboard vessels and at Marine Terminals. The proposed
amendments to the Marine Terminals standard are intended primarily to provide regulatory consistency with the proposed
Longshoring ship-board rules. The proposed rules would be ``vertical'' standards which apply to longshoring and
marine terminal activities only, except for those general industry provisions referenced within this proposed
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal contains requirements for longshoring and marine terminal operations; the testing and certification
of specific types of cargo lifting appliances and associated auxiliary gear; other cargo handling equipment such
as conveyors and industrial trucks; access to vessels; working surfaces; and personal protective equipment. Additionally,
specialized longshoring operations such as containerized cargo, roll-on roll-off (Ro-Ro) and menhaden are specifically
addressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal hazards addressed by this proposal are injuries and accidents associated with cargo lifting gear,
vehicular cargo transferral, manual cargo handling, hazardous atmospheres and materials, and finally, those hazards
posed by the more modern and sophisticated cargo handling methods brought about by intermodalism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provides notice of OSHA's intent to schedule informal public hearings on OSHA's proposed rulemaking on Longshoring
and the related Marine Terminal provisions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As a result of the high number and serious nature of accidents occurring to port workers in the United States, Congress,
in 1958, amended the Longshore and Harborworker's Compensation Act (LHWCA) (33 U.S.C. 901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to provide a large segment of port based employees with a safer work environment. The amendments (P.L. 85&hyph;742,
72 Stat. 835) significantly strengthened Section 41 of the LHWCA (33 U.S.C. 941) by requiring employers covered by
that Act to ``furnish, maintain and use'' equipment, and to establish safe working conditions in accordance with
regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor. Two years later, the Labor Standards Bureau (LSB) of the Department
of Labor issued the first set of safety and health regulations for longshoring activities as 29 CFR part 9 (25 FR 1565).
These standards were amended on several occasions between 1960 and 1971. Since 1971, there have been no substantive
changes to these provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the Act) (29 U.S.C. 650 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), which established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), directed the Secretary of Labor
to adopt, under the authority conferred by section 6(a) of the Act, ``Any established Federal standard'' as an OSHA
standard during the first 2 years of the Act. The Longshoring standards, then codified as 29 CFR part 1504, were adopted
by OSHA under section 6(a) in 1971, and were recodified as 29 CFR part 1918. The longshoring industry has changed dramatically
since 1971. The methods of cargo handling and the equipment associated with those methods have undergone significant
modification. Vessels designed specifically for the carriage of intermodal containers, vehicular rolling stock,
and even barges, are now the most common types of ships calling at U.S. ports. By contrast, the established Longshoring
standard was designed largely for activities being conducted using methods and equipment that have been overshadowed
or replaced by more modern methods of cargo handling. The proposal being published today will seek to modernize OSHA's
regulatory approach to deal with these changes in the industry. It is important to consider, however, that some of
the older, more conventional vessel configurations, equipped with features and aspects that are addressed in the
current standard, continue to call at U.S. ports. For that reason, the Agency will retain in this proposal a number
of provisions whose utility, although diminished, will continue to be necessary. Nevertheless, the Agency requests
the public to comment on certain provisions that it considers obsolete and no longer in use. For example, the Agency
is considering deleting the provisions that address the manually lowering or topping of booms based on a determination
that these operations are no longer performed as a part of longshoring work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 5, 1983, OSHA published its final rule for Marine Terminals (48 FR 30886)(Ex. 1&hyph;101). These rules were
designed to address the shoreside segment of marine cargo handling. Since the Marine Terminal standards currently
address equipment and situations (i.e., powered industrial trucks; conveyors; passage between levels and across
openings; etc.) that have shipboard counterparts, appropriate provisions from those standards are incorporated
into this proposal for shipboard cargo handling, as well. Accordingly, the Agency will rely upon background material
and data used to substantiate OSHA's rule for Marine Terminals, and incorporates the docket (S&hyph;506) developed
in that rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal seeks to provide a practical continuity as it addresses the more conventional and time proven methods
of cargo handling along with those more modern and revolutionary. The Agency welcomes all suggestions on how to better
meet this goal.

Longshoring Hazards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Traditionally, the longshore industry has been notable in terms of its accident experience. The work environment
found in the marine cargo handling sector exposes workers to a greater risk of injury than is true for most other industries.
In fact, in the last calendar year for which industrial illnesses and accidents are fully tabulated, this industrial
sector had one of the highest rate of lost workdays in the nation. The following tables found in BLS reports (Exs. 1&hyph;109,
1&hyph;110, 1&hyph;111, 1&hyph;112, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In 1985, OSHA requested the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to initiate a survey that could be used to develop common
aspects of accidents occurring within the current longshore sector (Ex. 1&hyph;73). This survey helped to point
out that in spite of the increases in automation that have occurred in the industry, injuries and lost workday cases
continue to remain high and the break bulk type of operation still accounts for a major portion of the injuries that

OSHA sought to validate even further the conclusions it could draw, both from this survey and from regularly published
BLS occupational safety and health statistics. In so doing, the Agency reviewed data published in

 magazine (April 1987). In an article entitled ``WGMA reports safety statistics for 85&hyph;86 contract year'' (Ex.
1&hyph;14), that periodical listed a number of pertinent figures that serve to corroborate the other accident information
OSHA has secured. The West Gulf Report, prepared by Mr. Hal Draper, Director of Safety; Health and Training for the
West Gulf Maritime Association, addressed the accident experience of several ports from Lake Charles, Louisiana
to Brownsville, Texas. Quoting directly from the article:

West Gulf Report. Draper's report on West Gulf longshore accidents during the 1985&hyph;86 contract year covered
a total of 1,192 incidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to his analysis, 70% of the accidents occurred on board ships; the remaining 30% on the dock or in the warehouse/terminal.
Cargo was involved in 30% of the accidents, 64% of which involved sacks/bags, and 12% steel/pipe. Two hundred and forty
of the incidents (20%) involved the individual being struck by a moving object; 221 (19%) resulted from lifting, pushing,
pulling or bodily reaction; 208 (17%) from falls from the same level-slip or trip; 142 (12%) from striking against,
or stepping/jumping on an object; 130 (11%) from being struck by a falling object; and 109 (9%) from being caught in,
under, or between objects. Thirteen percent of all accidents involved stevedore gear/equipment.

Another way the Agency attempted to identify the major sources of longshoring accidents for rulemaking purposes
was to examine a number of fatal or near fatal accidents reported to OSHA from this industry sector during the period
July 1972&hyph;March 1992. In conducting this analysis, OSHA examined these case files to determine the precise
cause of the accident. A brief summary of a few of the more than 250 such accidents reviewed is provided below.

a stokes basket stretcher to be transported ashore by the vessel's cargo hoisting gear. The stokes basket had no effective
means to secure the injured worker to the stretcher. While in transit, the injured worker fell out of the litter, back
into the hold (Ex. 1&hyph;90).

what was thought to be an available elevator to gain access to the ramp or discharge deck. The elevator was actually
at a higher deck. The employee and vehicle fell into the shaft and down three decks. Barricading of the open deck spaces

the trailer was being maneuvered into its stowage position. No signalman was provided to protect employees from the
hazard that ultimately killed this lasher (an employee engaged in securing cargo). Additionally, illumination
was severely lacking within the confines of the vessel's below deck cargo spaces. The use of proper illumination and
a signaller for this operation could have prevented the fatality (Ex. 1&hyph;89).

_March, 1992. One longshoreman was killed while working on top of a stack of containers on the deck of a container vessel.
A container top safety device was available, but the longshoreman was not attached to it. The safety device, which
was attached to the container crane spreader bar, moved and became hung up. When it released, it catapulted the longshoreman
off of the stack of containers and onto the dock. This incident could have been prevented if the employee had not been
working on the top of the container, or had been using fall protection if it were necessary to be working there (Ex. 1&hyph;108).

Based on the BLS data, the West Gulf Maritime Association's accident analysis, and OSHA's own analysis of fatal or
near fatal accidents in the cargo handling industry , OSHA concludes that regulatory action is necessary in order
to meet its mandate under the Act. See Section III, Statutory Considerations, below, for a complete discussion of
OSHA's ``significant risk'' findings.

II. General Format of the Standard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Vertical vs. Horizontal Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed Longshoring standard has been drafted in a manner that will allow it to stand by itself, i.e., to be a ``vertical''
standard. Vertical standards are those that apply specifically to a given industry, in lieu of any other OSHA standard.
In several areas of coverage specified in the proposal's scope section, OSHA's General Industry standards are incorporated
by reference. This approach follows OSHA's other marine cargo handling standard, Marine Terminals, 29 CFR part 1917
(48 FR 30886). Vertical standards can encourage voluntary compliance because they are directed to the particular
problems of the industry, and because they only contain provisions that are appropriate to the industry in question.
On the other hand, since many industries covered by OSHA do in fact use the same or similar equipment and processes,
and therefore have employees who are exposed to the same hazards, it is usually a more efficient use of the Agency's
resources to develop ``horizontal'' standards (those applying across industry lines). It is also more efficient
to train field personnel in general safety programs tailored to the horizontal General Industry standards than to
train field staff in individual programs designed for specific industries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1983, OSHA promulgated a vertical standard for the shoreside aspect of marine cargo handling (48 FR 30886)_OSHA's
rules for Marine Terminals. As was the case in that rulemaking, the Agency is proposing the inclusion of a list of applicable
General Industry standards which will supplement the specific provisions in part 1918. This provides coverage for
hazards for which the marine cargo handling industry is neither unique nor different from other industries. As an
example, OSHA proposes to adopt by reference 1910.95, titled ``occupational noise exposure.'' The detrimental
effects of prolonged high levels of noise is the same whether the exposure takes place aboard a vessel or in a factory.
The exposure may not be as constant or the workforce may not be subjected to the same type of noise day after day, however
the potential for overexposure is there. OSHA does not feel it is necessary to write a ``vertical'' standard that covers
exposure to noise when the General Industry standard will suffice. This is entirely consistent with the current coverage
provided by OSHA rules for Marine Terminals (part 1917).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of this proposed Longshore standard is a ``vertical'' standard. The work environment aboard ship is
unique in many respects. Longshore workers must continually work in the harsh environment of the waterfront, which
requires exposure both to work-related hazards, such as falling cargo, and to environmental hazards, such as drowning
and working around machinery in bad weather. Longshore workers perform some of the same high-hazard tasks, and confront
many of the same heavy-industry hazards, as those typically associated with the construction industry. Examples
of such hazards include falls, and crushing and caught-in injuries. Cargo handling and construction work are also
both weather-dependent and have a high proportion of part-time and transient employees. The extremely high occupational
injury and illness incidence rates for the marine cargo handling industry, mentioned in the previous section, testify
to the hazardous nature of the longshoring industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has decided to continue a vertical standard for many aspects of this high-hazard industry, supplemented by general
industry standards where necessary and appropriate. The Agency believes that this approach is necessary to adequately
address the unique hazards and working conditions of this industry. OSHA also has a vertical standard for the construction
industry (29 CFR part 1926), another hazardous industry with a large workforce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA solicits comments both as to the merits and the limitations of a vertical standard for longshoring operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Performance vs. Specification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The format and substance of this standard reflect OSHA's effort to eliminate unnecessary regulations and to simplify
and update others. To achieve these goals, the Agency has adopted a performance approach to writing new rules and revising
existing ones. A performance-based standard identifies a hazard and the level of control required to protect against
the hazard, without specifying the precise means of achieving such control, while a specification standard stipulates
design and construction criteria to be met to achieve a particular safety objective. The lack of flexibility in many
specification standards fails to take into account the adequacy of many existing operations and work practices and
discourages innovation. In keeping with OSHA's commitment to clarity, flexibility, and in order to encourage employers
to comply with the standards, this longshore industry proposal has adopted the performance approach except in those
cases in which employee safety would be enhanced by more specific requirements. The Agency is interested in receiving
comments from persons who feel that certain of the proposed provisions would benefit from a greater degree of specification
or from a more goal-oriented approach.

Introduction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Throughout this proposal, OSHA describes the hazards confronted by employees who are engaged in longshoring activities
and the measures required to protect affected employees from those hazards. The Agency is providing the following
discussion of the statutory mandate for OSHA rulemaking activity to explain the legal basis for its determination
that the Longshoring standard, as proposed, is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from significant
risks of injury and death.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2(b)(3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes ``the Secretary of Labor to set mandatory occupational
safety and health standards applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce'', and section 5(a)(2) provides
that ``each employer shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this Act'' (emphasis
added). Section 3(8) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C.  652(8)) provides that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. . . the term `occupational safety and health standard' means a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption
or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to
provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In two recent cases, reviewing courts have expressed concern that OSHA's interpretation of these provisions of the
OSH Act, particularly of section 3(8) as it pertains to safety rulemaking, could lead to overly costly or under-protective
safety standards. In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
International Union, UAW v. OSHA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the District of Columbia Circuit rejected substantive challenges to OSHA's lockout/tagout
standard and denied a request that enforcement of that standard be stayed, but it also expressed concern that OSHA's
interpretation of the OSH Act could lead to safety standards that are very costly and only minimally protective. In

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Grain &amp; Feed Association v. OSHA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 866 F.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1989), the Fifth Circuit concluded that Congress gave OSHA considerable discretion in structuring
the costs and benefits of safety standards but, concerned that the grain dust standard might be under-protective,
directed OSHA to consider adding a provision that might further reduce significant risk of fire and explosion. OSHA
rulemakings involve a significant degree of agency expertise and policy-making discretion to which reviewing courts
must defer. (See for example,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 448 U.S. 607, 655 n. 62 (1980).) At the same time, the Agency's technical expertise and policy-making authority must
be exercised within discernable parameters. The lockout/tagout and grain handling standard decisions sought from
OSHA more clarification on the agency's view of the scope of those parameters. In light of those decisions, OSHA believes
it would be useful to include in the preamble to this proposed safety standard a statement of its view of the limits of
its safety rulemaking authority and to explain why it is confident that its interpretive views have in the past avoided
regulatory extremes and continue to do so in this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stated briefly, the OSH Act requires that, before promulgating any occupational safety standard, OSHA demonstrate
based on substantial evidence in the record as a whole that: (1) the proposed standard will substantially reduce a
significant risk of material harm; (2) compliance is technologically feasible in the sense that the protective measures
being required already exist, can be brought into existence with available technology, or can be created with technology
that can reasonably be developed; (3) compliance is economically feasible in the sense that industry can absorb or
pass on the costs without major dislocation or threat of instability; and (4) the standard is cost effective in that
it employs the least expensive protective measures capable of reducing or eliminating significant risk. Additionally,
proposed safety standards must be compatible with prior agency action, must be responsive to significant comment
in the record, and, to the extent allowed by statute, must be consistent with applicable Executive Orders. These elements
limit OSHA's regulatory discretion for safety rulemaking and provide a decision-making framework for developing
a rule within their parameters.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Congress concluded that OSHA regulations are necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that
employers should be required to reduce or eliminate significant workplace health and safety threats. At section
2(a) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C.  651(a)), Congress announced its determination that occupational injury and illness
should be eliminated as much as possible: ``The Congress finds that occupational injury and illness arising out of
work situations impose a substantial burden upon, and are a hindrance to, interstate commerce in terms of lost production,
wage loss, medical expenses, and disability compensation payments.'' Congress therefore declared ``it to be its
purpose and policy ... to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe ... working conditions
[29 U.S.C.  651(b)].''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To that end, Congress instructed the Secretary of Labor to adopt existing Federal and consensus standards during
the first two years after the OSH Act became effective and, in the event of conflict among any such standards, to ``promulgate
the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees [29 U.S.C.  655(a)].''
Congress also directed the Secretary to set mandatory occupational safety standards [29 U.S.C.  651(b)(3)], based
on a rulemaking record and substantial evidence [29 U.S.C.  655(b)(2)], that are ``reasonably necessary or appropriate
to provide safe ... employment and places of employment.'' When promulgating permanent safety or health standards
that differ from existing national consensus standards, the Secretary must explain ``why the rule as adopted will
better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C.  655(b)(8)].'' Correspondingly,
every employer must comply with OSHA standards and, in addition, ``furnish to each of his employees employment and
a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious
physical harm to his employees [29 U.S.C.  654(a)].''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs
when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment. Congress viewed the costs of health and safety
as a cost of doing business.... Indeed, Congress thought that the financial costs of health and safety problems in
the workplace were as large as or larger than the financial costs of eliminating these problems [

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he vitality of the Nation's economy will be enhanced by the greater productivity realized through saved lives
and useful years of labor. When one man is injured or disabled by an industrial accident or disease, it is he and his family
who suffer the most immediate and personal loss. However, that tragic loss also affects each of us. As a result of occupational
accidents and disease, over $1.5 billion in wages is lost each year [1970 dollars], and the annual loss to the gross
national product is estimated to be over $8 billion. Vast resources that could be available for productive use are
siphoned off to pay workmen's compensation and medical expenses....Only through a comprehensive approach can we
hope to effect a significant reduction in these job death and casualty figures. [Id. at 518&hyph;19 (Senator Cranston)]
Congress considered uniform enforcement crucial because it would reduce or eliminate the disadvantage that a conscientious
employer might experience where inter-industry or intra-industry competition is present. Moreover, ``many employers_particularly
smaller ones_simply cannot make the necessary investment in health and safety, and survive competitively, unless
all are compelled to do so [Leg. Hist. at 144, 854, 1188, 1201].''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, the statutory text and legislative history make clear that Congress conclusively determined that OSHA regulation
is necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate
significant workplace health and safety threats.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
C. As construed by the courts and by OSHA, the OSH Act sets a threshold and a ceiling for safety rulemaking that provide
clear and reasonable parameters for agency action. OSHA has long followed the teaching that section 3(8) of the OSH
Act requires that, before it promulgates ``any permanent health or safety standard, [it must] make a threshold finding
that a place of employment is unsafe_in the sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened
by a change in practices [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Industrial Union Dept., AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 448 U.S. 607, 642 (1980) (plurality) (Benzene); emphasis was supplied in original].'' When, as frequently happens
in safety rulemaking, OSHA promulgates standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, it must
explain ``why the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard
[29 U.S.C.  655(b)(8)].'' Thus, national consensus and existing federal standards that Congress instructed OSHA
to adopt summarily within two years of the OSH Act's inception provide reference points concerning the least an OSHA
standard should achieve (29 U.S.C.  655(a)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, OSHA is precluded from regulating insignificant safety risks or from issuing safety standards that do
not at least lessen risk in a significant way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSH Act also limits OSHA's discretion to issue overly burdensome rules, as the agency also has long recognized
that ``any standard that was not economically or technologically feasible would 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a fortiori
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 not be `reasonably necessary or appropriate' under the Act. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Industrial Union Dept., v. Hodgson
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, [499 F.2d 467, 478 (D.C. Cir. 1974)] (`Congress does not appear to have intended to protect employees by putting their
employers out of business.') [American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc., 452 U.S. at 513 n. 31 (a standard is economically
feasible even if it portends `disaster for some marginal firms,' but it is economically infeasible if it `threaten[s]
massive dislocation to, or imperil[s] the existence of, the industry')].'' By stating the test in terms of ``threat''
and ``peril,'' the Supreme Court made clear in ATMI that economic infeasibility begins short of industry-wide bankruptcy.
OSHA itself has placed the line considerably below this level. (See for example, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ATMI
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 452 U.S. at 527 n. 50; 43 FR 27360 (June 23, 1978). Proposed 200 &mu;g/m3 PEL for cotton dust did not raise serious possibility
of industry-wide bankruptcy, but impact on weaving sector would be severe, possibly requiring reconstruction of
90 percent of all weave rooms. OSHA concluded that the 200 &mu;g/m3 level was not feasible for weaving and that 750 &mu;g/m3
was all that could reasonably be required). See also 54 FR 29245&hyph;246 (July 11, 1989); American Iron &amp; Steel
Institute, 939 F.2d at 1003. OSHA raised engineering control level for lead in small nonferrous foundries to avoid
the possibility of bankruptcy for about half of small foundries even though the industry as a whole could have survived
the loss of small firms.) Although the cotton dust and lead rulemakings involved health standards, the economic feasibility
ceiling established therein applies equally to safety standards. Indeed, because feasibility is a necessary element
of a ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' standard, this ceiling boundary is the same for health and safety rulemaking
since it comes from section 3(8), which governs all permanent OSHA standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All OSHA standards must also be cost-effective in the sense that the protective measures being required must be the
least expensive measures capable of achieving the desired end (ATMI, at 514 n. 32; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 838 F.2d 1258, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). OSHA gives additional consideration to financial impact in setting the period
of time that should be allowed for compliance, allowing as much as ten years for compliance phase-in. (See

, 453 U.S. 913 (1981).) Additionally, OSHA's enforcement policy takes account of financial hardship on an individualized
basis. OSHA's Field Operations Manual provides that, based on an employer's economic situation, OSHA may extend
the period within which a violation must be corrected after issuance of a citation (CPL. 2.45B, Chapter III, paragraph
E6d(3)(a), Dec. 31, 1990).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reach the necessary findings and conclusions that a safety standard substantially reduces a significant risk
of harm, is both technologically and economically feasible, and is cost effective, OSHA must conduct rulemaking
in accord with the requirements of section 6 of the OSH Act. The regulatory proceeding allows it to determine the qualitative
and, if possible, the quantitative nature of the risk with and without regulation, the technological feasibility
of compliance, the availability of capital to the industry and the extent to which that capital is required for other
purposes, the industry's profit history, the industry's ability to absorb costs or pass them on to the consumer, the
impact of higher costs on demand, and the impact on competition with substitutes and imports. (See ATMI at 2501&hyph;2503;
American Iron &amp; Steel Institute generally.) Section 6(f) of the OSH Act further provides that, if the validity
of a standard is challenged, OSHA must support its conclusions with ``substantial evidence in the record considered
as a whole,'' a standard that courts have determined requires fairly close scrutiny of agency action and the explanation
of that action. (See

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 647 F.2d at 1206&hyph;1207.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's powers are further circumscribed by the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which
provides a neutral forum for employer contests of citations issued by OSHA for noncompliance with health and safety
standards (29 U.S.C.  659&hyph;661; noted as an additional constraint in Benzene at 652 n. 59). OSHA must also respond
rationally to similarities and differences among industries or industry sectors. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Building and Construction Trades Dept., AFL-CIO v. Brock
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 838 F.2d 1258, 1272&hyph;73 (D.C. Cir. 1988).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA safety rulemaking is thus constrained first by the need to demonstrate that the standard will substantially
reduce a significant risk of material harm, and then by the requirement that compliance is technologically capable
of being done and not so expensive as to threaten economic instability or dislocation for the industry. Within these
parameters, further constraints such as the need to find cost-effective measures and to respond rationally to all
meaningful comment militate against regulatory extremes.

D. The proposed revisions of the Longshoring and Marine Terminal standards comply with the statutory criteria described
above and are not subject to the additional constraints applicable to section 6(b)(5) standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards that regulate hazards that are frequently undetectable because they are subtle or develop slowly or after
long latency periods, are frequently referred to as ``health'' standards. Standards that regulate hazards, like
explosions or electrocution, that cause immediately noticeable physical harm, are called ``safety'' standards.
(See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Grain &amp; Feed Assn., v. OSHA (NGFA II)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 866 F.2d 717, 731, 733 (5th Cir. 1989). As noted above, section 3(8) provides that all OSHA standards must be ``reasonably
necessary or appropriate.'' In addition, section 6(b)(5) requires that OSHA set health standards which limit significant
risk ``to the extent feasible.'' OSHA has determined that the proposed revisions of the Longshore and Marine Terminal
standards are safety standards, because these standards address hazards, such as falling, falling objects and crushing,
that are immediately dangerous to life or health, not the longer term, less obvious hazards subject to section 6(b)(5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSH Act and its legislative history clearly indicate that Congress intended for OSHA to distinguish between safety
standards and health standards. For example in section 2(b)(6) of the OSH Act, Congress declared that the goal of assuring
safe and healthful working conditions and preserving human resources would be achieved, in part: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
... by exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishing causal connections between diseases and work in
environmental conditions, and conducting other research relating to health problems, in recognition of the fact
that occupational health standards present problems often different from those involved in occupational safety.
The legislative history makes this distinction even clearer:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[The Secretary] should take into account that anyone working in toxic agents and physical agents which might be harmful
may be subjected to such conditions for the rest of his working life, so that we can get at something which might not be
toxic now, if he works in it a short time, but if he works in it the rest of his life might be very dangerous; and we want to
make sure that such things are taken into consideration in establishing standards. [Leg. Hist. at 502&hyph;503 (Sen.

 at 648&hyph;49]. Additionally, Representative Daniels distinguished between ``insidious `silent killers' such
as toxic fumes, bases, acids, and chemicals'' and ``violent physical injury causing immediate visible physical
harm'' (Leg. Hist. at 1003), and Representative Udall contrasted insidious hazards like carcinogens with ``the
more visible and well-known question of industrial accidents and on-the-job injury'' (Leg. Hist. at 1004). (See

In reviewing OSHA rulemaking activity, the Supreme Court has held that section 6(b)(5) requires OSHA to set ``the
most protective standard consistent with feasibility'' (Benzene at 643 n. 48). As Justice Stevens observed:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The reason that Congress drafted a special section for these substances ... was because Congress recognized that
there were special problems in regulating health risks as opposed to safety risks. In the latter case, the risks are
generally immediate and obvious, while in the former, the risks may not be evident until a worker has been exposed for
long periods of time to particular substances. [Benzene, at 649 n. 54.] Challenges to the grain dust and lockout/tagout
standards included assertions that grain dust in explosive quantities and uncontrolled energy releases that could
expose employees to crushing, cutting, burning or explosion hazards were harmful physical agents so that OSHA was
required to apply the criteria of section 6(b)(5) when determining how to protect employees from those hazards. Reviewing
courts have uniformly rejected such assertions. For example, the Court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
International Union, UAW v. OSHA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, 938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991) rejected the view that section 6(b)(5) provided the statutory criteria for regulation
of uncontrolled energy, holding that such a ``reading would obliterate a distinction that Congress drew between
'health' and 'safety' risks.'' The Court also noted that the language of the OSH Act and the legislative history supported
the OSHA position (International Union, UAW at 1314). Additionally, the Court stated: ``We accord considerable
weight to an agency's construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer, rejecting it only if unreasonable''
(International Union, UAW at 1313, citing Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Court reviewing the grain dust standard also deferred to OSHA's reasonable view that the Agency was not subject
to the feasibility mandate of section 6(b)(5) in regulating explosive quantities of grain dust (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (NGFA II), 866 F.2d 717, 733 (5th Cir. 1989)). It therefore applied the criteria of section 3(8), requiring the Agency
to establish that the standard is ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' to protect section 3(8), requiring the
Agency to establish that the standard is ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' to protect employee safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in Section I, Background, above, and Section V, Summary and Explanation of the Proposal and in Section
VIII, Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, below, OSHA has determined
that marine cargo handling activities pose significant risks to employees (18 fatalities and 7,593 injuries annually)
and that the provisions of the proposed rule are reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from those risks.
The Agency estimates that compliance with the proposed revisions of the Longshoring and Marine Terminal standards
will cost $4.7 million the first year and $1.8 million annually thereafter and will reduce the risk of the identified
hazards (preventing 3 fatalities and 1,262 injuries annually). This constitutes a substantial reduction of significant
risk of material harm for the population at risk of approximately 93,000 employees. The Agency believes that compliance
is technologically feasible because all of the provisions of the proposed standard can be met by using currently available
equipment, facilities, supplies, and work practices. Additionally, OSHA believes that compliance is economically
feasible, because, as documented in the Regulatory Impact Analysis, all regulated sectors can readily absorb or
pass on compliance costs during the standard's first five years, and economic benefits will exceed compliance costs
thereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As detailed in Section VIII, Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and Table
1, below, the standard's costs, benefits, and compliance requirements are consistent with those of other OSHA safety
standards, such as the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standard.

OSHA assessed employee risk by evaluating exposure to marine cargo handling hazards. The Agency acknowledges that
some industries covered by the proposed revisions of the Longshoring and Marine Terminal standards have more documented
marine cargo handling injuries or fatalities than do others. OSHA does not believe that the risk associated with exposure
to marine cargo handling related hazards varies according to the number of incidents documented for a particular
SIC code. OSHA has set the scope of the proposed revisions of the Longshoring and Marine Terminal standards to address
those situations where employees are exposed to marine cargo handling hazards, regardless of the relative frequency
of incidents. The Agency believes, based on analysis of the elements of the hazards identified, there is sufficient
information for OSHA to determine that employees in the covered sectors face significant risks marine cargo handling
activities. Therefore, the Agency has determined that all employees within the scope of the proposed standard face
a significant risk of material harm and that compliance with the proposed revisions of the Longshoring and Marine
Terminal standards is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from that risk.

IV. Review of General Industry Standards for Longshoring Operations Applicability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of all the work environments OSHA regulates, the shipboard workplace ranks high among those that do not track easily
with many of the regulations that comprise 29 CFR part 1910 (General Industry standards). For instance, subjects
such as scaffolding; powered platforms; power presses; wood working machinery; abrasive wheels; forging machines;
pulp and paper mills; bakery equipment; laundry machinery; sawmills; logging; telecommunications; and spray painting,
all of which receive comprehensive discussion within the text of part 1910, are virtually non-existent concerns
in shipboard longshoring operations. Essentially longshoring is a transport industry and, as such, is free from
many of the hazards found in general industry. Accordingly, these provisions are not included in this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some areas where there is current coverage in part 1918, there is similar coverage in part 1910. OSHA's primary concern
is to make sure that the 1910 provisions needed to supplement the 1918 coverage are included in the proposal. For instance,
subjects such as ladders; slings; conveyors; industrial trucks; cranes and personal protective equipment, which
are fully addressed within part 1910, are presently addressed with a specific regard for the maritime workplace,
within OSHA's current Longshoring rules. This proposal seeks to update and revise the existing part 1918 and in some
instances has relied in substantial measure upon part 1910 language. In other instances, such as when addressing
container and roll on/roll off operations, entirely new concepts have been developed to take account of the sometimes
unique operational aspects of the modern stevedoring community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the hazards present in shipside cargo handling are directly parallel to those encountered in the shoreside
aspect of marine cargo handling, such as in sanitation considerations, OSHA is proposing that the language of provisions
designed to address such shoreside hazards be the same as in the Marine Terminal standards in 29 CFR part 1917.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties are requested to submit any information related to the coverage of this proposed revision of the
Longshoring rules. For example, are specific hazards adequately addressed in this proposal? Are longshore worker
exposed to safety and health hazards which this proposal does not adequately address? Have unnecessary provisions
been included in the proposal? Are there any areas of general industry coverage that have not been included in the proposal
that should be? OSHA would particularly appreciate information on these issues.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Proposed 1918.1 describes the scope and applicability of the Longshoring standard. The Longshoring rules apply
from the foot of the gangway up, to include all cargo handling related activities aboard a given vessel. It is important
to remember, however, that in ship to shore/shore to ship cargo transfer operations using shore based material handling
devices, all lifting device specific aspects of such transfers will be covered by the part 1917 rules. When cargo transfer
is accomplished using ship's cargo gear, the part 1918 rules shall apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with the concept outlined in the foregoing section of this preamble (II. General Format of the Standard),
certain selected provisions currently found in OSHA's part 1910 standards have been identified to have application
to shipboard longshoring operations. Sections 1918.1(b)(1) through (4), (b)(6) through (8), and (b)(10) through
(12) provide coverage for hazards for which the marine cargo handling industry is neither unique nor different from
other industries. These hazards are not otherwise addressed by existing maritime standards. The hazards addressed
by 1918.1(b)(5) (Tools) and (b)(9) (Machine Guarding), on the other hand, are addressed by existing maritime standards
but do not receive the comprehensive treatment afforded by part 1910, subpart P, (Hand and Portable Powered Tools
and Other Hand-Held Equipment) and subpart O, (Machinery and Machine Guarding).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is proposing to delete the current requirements for hand tools, 1918.72, titled Tools, and replace it with Subpart
P of 29 CFR part 1910, titled Hand and Portable Powered Tools and Other Hand-Held Equipment. OSHA believes that the
general Industry Subpart P regulations are more comprehensive and afford better protection. OSHA proposes to do
the same in the Marine Terminal regulations by replacing the paragraphs under the sections heading Hand tools, 1917.51
and replacing them with 29 CFR 1910 subpart P.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the same reasons, OSHA is also proposing to remove the requirements under 1917.151 titled Machine guarding, and
replace them with Subpart O of the General Industry standards, part 1910, titled Machinery and Machine Guarding.
OSHA is also proposing to include Subpart O, Machinery and machine guarding, to the Scope and Applicability section
of part 1918. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA promulgated the hazardous waste operations and emergency response (HAZWOPER) standard on March 6, 1989 (54
FR 9294). OSHA'S decision to cover all emergency response was based upon the high risk associated with emergency response
by untrained and unprotected employees and the need for proper training and equipment to be provided for emergency
response to hazardous substance releases. This standard currently applies in its entirety to shipboard longshoring
operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAZWOPER divides emergency response into three separate areas: (1) Response at uncontrolled hazardous waste sites
(1910.120(l)); (2) response at Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, facilities (42
U.S.C. 6901 et seq.) 1910.120(p)(8); and (3) response to emergency hazardous substance releases not covered by the
previously noted paragraphs 1910.120(q). Since the activities described in the first two areas of the HAZWOPER standard
do not represent marine cargo handling activities within the scope of part 1917 or part 1918, OSHA is proposing to only
apply 1910.120(q) to longshore (part 1918) and marine terminal operations (part 1917). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (q) covers employees engaged in toxic substance emergency response no matter where it occurs. This paragraph,
essentially, requires employers to develop and implement an emergency response plan to handle anticipated toxic
substance emergencies prior to the commencement of emergency response operations. If employers decide to evacuate
their employees from the danger area when an emergency occurs and do not permit their employees to assist in handling
the emergency, they are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph if they provide an emergency action plan and
meet other requirements in accordance with 1910.38(a) which states: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The emergency action plan shall be in writing *&blank;*&blank;* and shall cover those designated actions employers
and employees must take to ensure employee safety from fire and other emergencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Simply stated, if an employer decides ``not to fight a fire'' (i.e., not to respond to an emergency), then 1910.120(q)
does not apply but 1910.38(a) does.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is proposing to delete the current requirements for hand tools, 1918.72, titled Tools, and replace it with subpart
P of 29 CFR Part 1910, titled Hand and Portable Powered Tools and Other Hand-Held Equipment. OSHA believes that the
general Industry subpart P regulations are more comprehensive and afford better protection. OSHA proposes to do
the same in the Marine Terminal regulations by replacing the paragraphs under the sections heading Hand tools, 1917.51
and replacing with 29 CFR part 1910 subpart P.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the same reasons, OSHA is also proposing to remove the requirements under 1917.51 titled Machine guarding, and
replace them with subpart O of the General Industry Standards, part 1910, titled Machinery and Machine Guarding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.2 carries over many of the definitions from the current Longshoring regulations. However, there are
some new definitions or some modifications to existing definitions that reflect changes in current custom and practice
in the Longshore industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the term ``designated person'', which is not used in the current longshore regulation, is used in this
proposal. The term is used to identify a person who has a special skill in a particular area and has been so noted by the
employer. Because of this skill, this employee is assigned to perform specific tasks in this area of expertise. While
the concept of ``designated person'' is found throughout the current requirements, it is expressed in many different
ways. This proposal tightens up the use of this concept by its consistent use of the term ``designated person'' throughout
the standard. Some examples of the use of the term are: 1918.51(b) requires that a designated representative, in lieu
of the employer, shall inspect vessel's cargo gear before use and at intervals during use; and 1918.55 (c)(7) where
a designated person is one with knowledge in crane operations, specifically when using two or more cranes to hoist
in unison, along with knowledge in rigging.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the current references to the ``Federal maritime jurisdiction'' and ``navigable waters'' in the definitions
of ``employee'' in paragraph (e) and ``employer'' in paragraph (f) are being dropped. The current rules were originally
promulgated under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 941) for which the navigable waters
was a jurisdictional prerequisite. With the promulgation of the OSH Act, which applies to private sector employment
in workplaces in a covered jurisdiction, however, such a prerequisite was no longer necessary. Therefore, OSHA is
proposing to update these rules by eliminating the reference to navigable waters in this definition. Additionally,
several new or substantially revised definitions are found in paragraphs (d), (g), (h), (j), (k), and (n) of this section.
The definitions for enclosed space and fumigant are added to this section for clarity since these terms are used in
the standard. In addition, they are virtually identical, with the exception of the examples, to those found in the
Marine Terminal standards. The term ``hazardous cargo'' has been expanded to reflect the Marine Terminal's definition
of ``hazardous cargo, materials, substance or atmosphere.'' This definition goes beyond the current part 1918 definition
by including references to subpart Z as well as oxygen-deficient atmospheres. Additionally, it is, in turn, consistent
with the Hazardous Communication standard found at 29 CFR 1910.1200. Another new definition is integral to the major
impetus for revising part 1918, as discussed above: ``intermodal container.'' The definition for ``intermodal
container'' reflects both the definition found in the International Labor Organization (ILO) Code of Practice for
Safety and Health in Dock Work, (Ex. 1&hyph;135) and the definition found in International Standards Organization
(ISO) Standard 830, Freight Containers-Terminology, (Ex. 1&hyph;134). This definition is also being proposed
to replace the current definition for ``intermodal container'' found in the Marine Terminal standard, 1917.2(u).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definitions of ``dockboards'' and ``ramps'', currently found in the Marine Terminal standard, are being proposed
for Longshoring, as well, with minor modification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain definitions currently in part 1918 would be deleted. Existing definitions referring to the existing 1918.13,
certification of shore-based material handling devices were deleted because they were superseded by the Marine
Terminal standard. The existing definition of the term ``shall'' is being deleted as unnecessary.

Section 1918.11 Gear certification
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Since 1960, safety and health regulations designed to protect U.S. dockworkers (with particular regard to vessel's
cargo handling gear) have relied upon the documentary proofs of tests and examinations mandated by International
Labor Organization (ILO) Convention 32 (Ex. 1&hyph;34). In Article 9 of that Convention, units and articles comprising
ship's cargo handling gear are enumerated and assigned an annual/quadrennial schedule of tests/examinations that
must be attended and attested to by individuals judged to be ``competent'' by the national authorities of the vessel's
registry. Although not a signatory to that Convention, the United States has conformed to this Convention via regulation
promulgated by: (1) the U.S. Coast Guard, with regard to inspected U.S. flag vessels; and (2) OSHA, with regard to foreign
flag vessels (1918.12). The Coast Guard has promulgated cargo gear regulations that exceed those found in Convention
32, namely 46 CFR part 91, that promote safe and unencumbered operations for U.S. flag vessels trading at foreign ports.
On foreign flag vessels trading at U.S. ports, however, OSHA has sole responsibility for regulating and enforcing
rules that address the cargo gear U.S. longshore workers utilize.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Convention 32, proof load testing
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 was only required initially before being taken into service. Thereafter, components such as derricks, goosenecks,
mast bands, derrick bands and any other difficult to disassemble fixed gear, were to be ``thoroughly examined'' every
four years and ``inspected'' every 12 months. Other hoisting machinery, such as cranes, winches, blocks, shackles,
and any other accessory gear, were to be ``thoroughly examined'' every 12 months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
1Proof load testing, as used here, means lifting an known weight that is in excess of the safe working load (SWL) of the
lifting appliance being tested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Convention 32, the vessel's cargo handling gear was proof load tested initially, and then perhaps never again.
After that initial test, such gear received various degrees of visual scrutiny, complemented on some occasions by
non-destructive testing, i.e., a hammer test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Convention 152, adopted June 25, 1979, requires that such proof load testing is to occur at least every five years,
and applies to all ship's lifting appliances. Within Article 3 of the new Convention, the term ``lifting appliance''
is defined as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Lifting appliance covers all stationary or mobile cargo-handling appliances, including shore-based power-operated
ramps, used on shore or on board ship for suspending, raising or lowering loads or moving from one position to another
while suspended or supported. (Ex. 1&hyph;5, pg.2)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, the extent of cargo handling equipment found aboard ship requiring testing and certification, heretofore
restricted to specific assemblies and components (i.e., derricks, cranes, winches, etc.) is being expanded in this
proposal to include all ``lifting appliances'' under the terms of the newer ILO Convention. This would include forklifts
and other powered industrial equipment used to handle cargo that might be carried by a Ro-Ro vessel; and elevators
found on Ro-Ro vessels used to move cargo from one deck level to another_in addition to vessel cranes and derricks.
Under this proposal in 1918.11, all this equipment would be required to be tested and thoroughly examined initially
before being put into use; retested and thoroughly examined every five years; and thoroughly examined every 12 months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those situations where one container is used to lift another container, using twist locks, then the upper container
and twist locks become, in effect, a lifting appliance and must be certified as such.

International Aspects

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As is the case with all Federal agencies whose regulations impact international trade, OSHA has developed this proposal
in light of international considerations. Through both law and policy, the United States has decided that standards-related
activities shall not unnecessarily be a barrier to trade. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 2501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Additionally, and consonant with this country's position on barriers to international trade, the United States
is a signatory to the Multilateral Convention on the Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (1965) (Ex.
1&hyph;3). As a contracting government, the United States has agreed to:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Mindful of these international aspects, OSHA sought to formulate an acceptable approach to the vessel's cargo handling
gear issue, and to other issues. The Agency requested the Department of State (Ex. 1&hyph;7) to present OSHA's tentative
approach to all foreign nations whose flags may enter U.S. ports. This exercise was conducted in hope of ascertaining
global acceptance. Reports back from responding foreign nations (Ex. 1&hyph;6) indicated overwhelming support
for the Agency's approach to these issues, and OSHA has incorporated it in this proposal. Most nations, although stipulating
that they had not as yet ratified the more recent ILO Convention, indicated that national laws recently ratified or
those currently in the legislative process were at least as strong, and in some cases more stringent, than Convention
152. In consideration of this widespread international acceptance of ILO Convention 152's approach to testing and
certification of cargo gear, OSHA has decided to propose it in this revision of the Longshoring standards. The Agency
is interested in any additional comment on this issue that interested parties may be in a position to offer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1918.21 Gangways and other means of access
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This proposed section joins together two similar sections (1918.11_Gangways and 1918.21_Gangways and Other Means
of Access) of OSHA's current Longshoring rules. Clarity is improved in that rules addressing the same specific issue
will no longer be situated in two different subparts of part 1918. As is the case in the current rules, gangway dimensions
and characteristics are set out in proposed paragraph (a) to provide the safe access to vessels necessary for longshore
workers. By using a blend of specification with performance based alternatives, the proposal lends the flexibility
needed in accommodating foreign vessels. Language has been added that allows the use of materials that have been developed
since the current rule was written, as long as the material has a strength equivalent to those that are listed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) carries over language from the current rules, as well as the term ``trimmed'' found in the Joint
Maritime Safety Code of the New York Shipping Association/ International Longshoremen's Association (NYSA/ILA
Safety Code) (Ex. 1&hyph;2) part M, paragraph 1), and requires that despite changing conditions brought about by
tides, cargo operations, etc., the gangway and its components must be wholly serviceable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraphs (c) through (k) are similar to the language found in the current rules. Some paragraphs have been
modified to address some problems associated with the current language. Paragraph (d) has been modified to require
a safety net or suitable protection when the gangway overhangs the water in such a manner that there is a danger of employees
falling between the ship and the dock. The net is required to prevent an employee from falling to a lower level. This
is consistent with ILO'S ``Safety and Health in Dock Work,'' (Ex. 1&hyph;138). A new paragraph (i) has been added to
address the hazard associated with slippery handrails and walking surfaces on gangways. Paragraph (j) references
1918.92 for illumination requirements on a gangway. In summary, these paragraphs address the requirement for a safe
passage from the dock to the deck.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (l) recognizes the U.S. Coast Guard's authority relating to jurisdictional matters aboard vessels
having a current and valid certificate of inspection. Notwithstanding, for the purpose of this rule, if access is
attained other than by the vessel's regular gangway, that access shall conform to the entirety of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.22 carries over language from the current rules. Both paragraphs of this section contain the standard
universal criteria for rope ladders, also known as ``Jacob's ladders'', namely, that such ladders be either double-runged
or flat-treaded, so as to provide a more substantial tread surface; that they be well maintained and properly secured
to available fittings; and that they not be permitted to hang from their lashing points with slack in them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is often the case that such ladders are provided by the vessel when a more traditional means of access cannot be utilized.
Notwithstanding, under these proposed rules the employer (who is often a contractor rendering a service to the vessel)
must comply with this proposed section before employees are permitted to use these ladders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.23 also carries over language from the current rules. Paragraph (a) sets out criteria for ramps used
to gain vehicular access to or between barges. Of primary importance is that such ramps be of sufficient strength for
the intended load. These ramps must be equipped with sideboards that will prevent vehicles from falling. They must
also be well maintained and properly secured during use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) addresses employee passage to and from certain floating craft. Under favorable conditions, it is sometimes
possible to pass to and from such vessels without the aid of any device. In other than favorable conditions, however,
this paragraph sets forth the criteria to provide safe passage. Of significant importance is the exception included
at the end of the paragraph. That exception recognizes practical difficulties encountered on the Mississippi River
system in providing traditional means of access on all occasions. When originally promulgated in 1960, the longshore
rules (Ex. 1&hyph;39) took no cognizance of these special difficulties. In 1965, the Labor Standards Bureau published
the following proposed clarification, (Ex. 1&hyph;40):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to provide practical solutions in cases where current requirements cannot be met, because of local river
and bank conditions (this section) should be amended by the addition of a provision. (p.7609)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A provision to that effect was published in the Federal register in final form on May 21, 1966 (Ex. 1&hyph;41). Historically
(Ex. 1&hyph;98), this exception has been based on tidal and current conditions on the Mississippi system (see definition
at proposed 1918.2(s)). OSHA's experience has thus far concluded that such exceptional conditions prevail only
on this inland system; however, the Agency solicits comments from interested individuals with other information
on this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A sentence has been added to proposed 1924.23(c) that requires no more than two Jacob's ladders for any single barge,
raft, or log boom being worked. This proposal is consistent with the requirements in 1918.25(a) which requires a maximum
of two access ladders in a hatch. The term ``gang'' is used here and several other places in this proposal. It refers
to a group of longshore persons that are assigned to a particular hold, deck, etc. on a ship for the purpose of loading
or discharging cargo.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (e) has been added to this section to address the problem associated with the lower rungs of a Jacob's
ladder being crushed between the barge and another structure by requiring that a spacer or equivalent means be used
to prevent it from occurring. If the lower rungs are crushed, this could cause an employee to fall between the barge
and other structure. Another new paragraph (f) has been added to this section. This paragraph requires the a net or
equivalent protection if there is a space between the vessel, barge or other structure when using a Jacob's ladder
to prevent an employee from falling into the water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.24 combines the current language of the existing longshore provisions for bridge plates and ramps
with the terms that apply to similar shoreside equipment within 29 CFR part 1917 (Marine Terminals, 1917.124).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the adoption of such parallel rules, OSHA hopes to enhance the uniformity of regulation that is critical to safety
performance both shipboard and shoreside. Throughout this proposal, the Agency has attempted to foster such uniformity
and requests comments as to how this goal can be better achieved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) and (b)(1)(v) would be revised to require sideboards that are at least 6 inches (.16 m) high.
This height is the same as found for bull rails that were in place at the time of the effective date of the Marine Terminal
standard, found in 1917.112. OSHA believes that specifying the height of the sideboards will provide the necessary
protection to prevent vehicles and equipment from accidently falling off the edge. OSHA requests comment from the
public concerning appropriateness of the height of the sideboards. OSHA is also proposing to require the same 6 inch
(.16 m) sideboards for dockboards and ramps that are in the Marine Terminal standard, 1917.124.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.25 combines the current requirements for portable ladders contained in the existing Longshoring
rules with the similar rules of 1917.119. For fixed ladders, however, there is a distinction between the proposed
and current Longshore standard which has to do with clearance in back of the ladder rungs. The existing requirement
is 4 inches (.11 m), but the proposed clearance is 6 inches (.16 m), which reflects the current ILO Standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with ILO's Guide to Safety and Health in Dock Work, (Ex. 1&hyph;129), OSHA is proposing that vessels built
after December 5, 1981, (the date when ILO Convention 152, Occupational Safety and Health in Dock Work was put into
effect), have a 6-inch (15 cm) clearance between the ladder and the surface to which it is fastened. Vessels built prior
to December 5, 1981, however, may have a 4 inch (10 cm) clearance between the ladder and the surface to which it is fastened.
OSHA encourages comment on this issue. (It should be noted where a fixed ladder has inadequate clearance, a suitable
portable ladder could be used.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, proposed 1918.25 includes much of the current language for ladders with some modifications. Provisions
have been added that reference ANSI standards for manufactured portable ladders. There are also proposed provisions
for ladder maintenance and usage that are similar to what is in the Marine Terminals standard, but are new to Longshoring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraphs 1918.25(c) and (e) the phrase ``positively secured against shifting or slipping'' has been changed
to ``positively secured or held against shifting or slipping while in use''. This change acknowledges that a worker(s)
may hold a portable ladder in place while another worker is climbing the ladder in situations where the ladder cannot
be secured and is consistent with the PMA-ILWU Safety Code, Rule 1506 (Ex. 1&hyph;145). In addition, for the purpose
of clarifying paragraph (e), where the employer can demonstrate that employees can safely use the cargo itself to
climb in and out of the hold (often referred to as ``safe cargo steps''), a straight ladder is not necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (j)(8) on, ladder usage, acknowledges that while some ladders may not have slip-resistant bases, they
can be readily secured by lashing them in place to prevent slipping or shifting when being used.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA clearly understands that many of the falling hazards addressed in part by this and other subparts, represent
working environments and physical characteristics no longer observed with the type of frequency that was the case
when the current Longshoring rules were last revised. Nonetheless, conventional cargo handling methods together
with more traditional vessel designs are still encountered at U.S. ports. For this reason, OSHA proposes to retain
current provisions that still have application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an example, proposed 1918.31(c) prohibits employers from allowing work to be conducted on surfaces comprised
of missing, broken or poorly fitting hatch covers. Currently, it is relatively rare to experience a vessel trading
at U.S. ports, fitted with the type of removable hatch covers this provision addresses. Despite that rarity, such
situations do arise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.31(d) prohibits the placing of poorly fitting hatch covers and hatch beams that would constitute a
work surface. As a practical matter, it is rare to see vessels at U.S. ports fitted out with hatch beams. In those instances,
however, identifying marks are usually permanently fixed to such equipment. Those marks correspond to marks found
on receptacle fittings on the vessel proper. In all cases, notwithstanding the presence of corresponding marks,
the employer must make sure that all hatch beams and covers are seated securely, providing a strong and stable work
surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.32(a) carries over language from the current Longshoring rule. Frequently cargo must be landed on
temporary surfaces, generally presented by other cargo stows, prior to its ultimate place of rest. When this is so,
it is important that employees have enough available space to work in safety upon such a surface, and that the temporary
table is strong enough to safely support the loads being imposed. There are obviously many strength and size possibilities,
which will be dictated by the size and weight of the drafts being landed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.32(b) has been revised to address changes that have occurred in technology and work practices. Employees
working on the tops of containers are now covered by 1918.85(j), Container top safety. (For a full discussion see the
preamble to 1918.85(j) below). When employees working in cargo holds, are exposed to falls of more than 8 feet (2.4
m), the edge of the working surface must be guarded by a safety net, or must be otherwise rendered safe (such as by providing
guardrails or fall arrest systems) to prevent employee injury. It should be noted that proposed 1918.32(b) does not
include employees working on the top of intermodal containers in a hold as this is also covered under 1918.85(j).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of prime importance is that the intent of this provision is satisfied, rather than providing just the appearance of
compliance. Many times, particularly when safety nets have been rigged, they have been allowed to become very slack,
and have sometimes been secured only at their top ends. The improper rigging of safety nets compromises or even removes
the protection provided to falling employees. In these very critical fall hazard situations, this provision insists
that fully considered precautions are taken. The Pacific Coast Marine Safety Code (PCMSC) Rule 1016 (Ex. 1&hyph;145)
is very similar in construction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph has also been revised to distinguish between the purpose and use of vertical safety nets, which rise
at right angles at the perimeter of a work surface thus preventing employees from falling, and trapeze nets, which
are designed to be placed horizontally below a raised work surface to prevent falling employees from striking the
surface below. Additionally, this section requires that any nets used for purposes of fall protection meet the applicable
requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.33(a) and (b) are carried over from the current Longshoring rules. As the heading of this section indicates,
these provisions address the safe performance of work on or around deck loads. Provisions for work performed by employees
atop deck-stowed intermodal containers will be found at proposed 1918.85(j). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is proposing to change the title and text of 1918.34. The current title of this section is ``Skeleton decks.''
OSHA has consulted, without success, numerous individuals from the maritime community and researched several maritime
publications, textbooks, etc. in an effort to define the terms ``skeleton deck'' and ``mechano deck.'' OSHA feels
that the use of these terms and the practice of working cargo on these particular types of decks are obsolete. Since
the hazards remain even though these terms do not, OSHA is proposing to change the title of the section to ``Other decks''
in order to group unique or uncommon decks; using generic language to address the hazards associated with landing
cargo on such decks that are not designed for such use. OSHA encourages the public to comment on whether the terms ``skeleton
deck'' and ``mechano deck'' should be kept in the text of the standard and on whether these provisions are necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.35 addresses hazards longshore workers face when conducting operations around open weather deck
hatchways. Vessels calling at U.S. ports are of varied designs and capabilities. Some vessels have coamings, which
are the vertical structure that surrounds the hatch opening on a ship, that are substantially higher than the proposed
section's minimum acceptable range (36 to 42 inches) (.92 to 1.07 m) other vessels may have no hatch coamings at all,
but rather flush decks or decks with an abbreviated sill, which present substantial fall hazards to longshore workers.
On such vessels, when workers work around the perimeter of open hatchways, appropriate guarding must be provided.
This proposal stipulates that taut lines or guardrails attaining the acceptable range be erected on all but the working
side of the hatch. This proposal mandates that stanchions or uprights used in their construction be supported or secured
in a manner that will prevent them from coming accidentally loose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.37 addresses the fall hazards associated with working on the decks of lighters and barges. Proposed
paragraph (a) retains language from the current rule. It prohibits the use of marginal (less than 3 feet (.92 m) wide)
deck space along the sides of covered lighters or barges on all such vessels having coamings over 5 feet (1.5 m) high.
Alternately, an employer must provide a taut handline or, as is most often the case, the vessel must be fitted with a
serviceable grab rail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b), also retains language from the current rule. It prohibits working or walking on unsound surfaces.
This can be a particularly important consideration on barges, in that powered industrial trucks are often brought
aboard to assist in operations. The proposed rule requires a visual check of such decks before loading operations
begin. If during the course of discharge operations an unsafe surface is discovered, work must be discontinued until
protective measures are taken (such as bridging the unsafe surface with steel plate or barricading a deck section
deemed unsafe).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.38, as well as 1918.88 titled ``log operations'' are entirely new sections addressing log loading
operations and reflect current industry practice. Section 1918.38 is based on Rules 640 and 641 of the PCMSC (Ex. 1&hyph;145);
on a report on log operations submitted to OSHA's Maritime Safety Standards Office by Region X (Ex. 1&hyph;146); and
a training video on log operations produced by the PMA and ILWU (Ex. 1&hyph;147). Loading logs from water presents
very serious falling and drowning hazards. Thus, safe walking working surfaces are extremely important to longshore
workers who are positioned offshore during log loading operations. Sound footing is essential during access to and
while working on log rafts, which are in fact the cargo. The proposed requirements provide for safe access to the worksite
and a safe working surface area. The working surface must be wide enough to allow for stable footing, securely fastened
together, and substantial enough to support the weight of the employees on it. OSHA has concluded that the basic requirements
for providing such safe surfaces should be included in this rulemaking, and seeks comment on their completeness.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed 1918.41 addresses coaming clearances and provides requirements to protect longshore workers from fall
hazards and from being struck by falling cargo during the process of opening up and closing hatches. Proposed paragraph
(a) addresses weather deck clearances. When a smooth-sided deck load is stowed within 3 feet (.92 m) of the hatch coaming,
and the available coaming height is &lt;24 inches, a taut handline shall be provided so that employees are able to safely
remove or replace hatch beams and covers. Similar language covering such situations is found in the NYSA/ILA Joint
Maritime Safety Code_part C/Rule 38 (Ex. 1&hyph;2) and the PCMSC_Rule 1007 (Ex. 1&hyph;145).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout this proposal, OSHA has specified that ``taut'' lines or ``taut'' handrails or guardrails be provided
in certain situations where available walking or working space is compromised because of inevitable stowage or vessel
design considerations. In using the term taut, as with other terms commonly encountered in maritime safety codes,
OSHA is using language which is familiar in the industry under current practices. Where necessary, OSHA is proposing
definitions for various terms used in the proposed standards, to ensure that these terms are uniformly understood.
To be as clear as possible with regard to its intention in utilizing the term ``taut'' in connection with the subject
lines, handrails and guardrails, the Agency states that ``taut'' connotes tightly and securely drawn, and as length
and distance may warrant, securely fastened at intervals. The idea behind providing these taut lines, etc., is to
allow an employee to rely on these objects in maintaining or regaining a stable balance in a constrained work area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, guardrails successfully serve their purpose when their height can stay within a serviceable range (42
to 36 inches) (1.07 m to .92 m). ``Taut'' handrails and ``taut'' lines, however, are sometimes required to be fitted
to objects and structures of varying dimensions (such as deck cargo and the sides of covered lighters) for the purpose
of enabling an employee to maintain balance and footing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b)(1) addresses intermediate deck hatchway clearance, and requires that a 3 foot (.91 m) clear
work area be provided between stowed cargo and hatch coaming at both sides and one end of hatches with athwartship beams,
and at both ends of hatches with fore and aft beams, while employees are engaged in opening or closing the hatchway.
Proposed paragraph (b)(2) makes it clear that the 3-foot (.91 m) working surface under proposed paragraph (b)(1),
is not required when a fall hazard is not present. Proposed paragraph (b)(3) recognizes that fitted grating over-decking,
such as the type used in some perishables trades, can be considered part of the actual deck or working space (for the
purposes of assessing compliance with proposed paragraph (b)(1)), if they are properly placed within the 3-foot
clearance area and if they are in good condition (flush fitting and presenting a level work surface). OSHA has dropped
the reference to ``banana'' gratings because OSHA feels it is an unnecessary reference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (c) would require grab rails or taut hand lines to be provided where, because of wing-space structures
or spare parts storage, coaming clearance is minimized. Proposed paragraph (d) advises that this proposed section
is inapplicable in situations that permit the opening and closing of hatches without employees having to place or
remove individual sections manually. It cautions, however, that whenever the 3-foot clearance is lacking, cargo
which is likely to shift or fall must be blocked or otherwise restrained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.42, similar to 1918.41, is carried over substantively in its entirety from the current longshore rules,
although some editing has been done for clarity. Provisions in this section addresses the hazards associated with
handling hatch beams and pontoons, such as falling into the hatch or being struck by these removable items. Equivalent
rules can be found on section 2 of the PCMSC (Ex. 1&hyph;145) and parts C and O of the NYSA/ILA Joint Maritime Safety Code
(Ex. 1&hyph;2). In summary, it is proposed that hatch beam and pontoon bridles be long enough to easily fit their attachment
points. Hatch beam bridles must be equipped with attachment devices that cannot become accidentally dislodged,
such as toggles. Pontoon bridles are required to have the appropriate number of legs to conform to the design of the
cover. All such legs must be utilized when lifting. If all legs of a bridle cannot be used due to the design of the cover,
the spare leg(s) must be prevented from free swinging. Finally, as for the construction of these bridles, OSHA requires
that for proper manual guidance, at least two legs be fitted with a fibre rope lanyard, and that the bridle end of the
lanyard (the end attached directly to the bridle) be constructed of chain or wire rope.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.43 is generally carried over from the current longshore rules, with some changes made for clarity,
a revision to paragraph (j), and the addition of a new paragraph (i). Provisions in this section address the hazards
associated with handling and stowing of hatch boards, hatch beams, and pontoons, such as falling into the hatch or
being struck by improperly stowed items. Similar requirements are found in Section X of the PCMSC (Ex. 1&hyph;145),
part O of the NYSA/ILA code (Ex. 1&hyph;2), and ILO Convention 152.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In revised paragraph (j), tarpaulins may be used to reduce the dust emissions of bulk cargoes instead of night tents
if the vessel lacks cargo gear. In these situations, OSHA requires positive means, such as placards or barricades,
be taken to prevent employees from walking on the tarpaulin that is covering an open or partially open hatch. Verbal
warnings or instructions do not satisfy this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (i) is being proposed to address the hazards of unsecured materials falling from hatch covers when
they are being moved overhead.

Subpart F_Vessel's Cargo Handling Gear
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed subpart F would apply to all gear and equipment used in cargo handling that is the property of the vessel. Examples
of this type of equipment can include cranes, derricks, specialized bridles, winches, wire rope, and shackles. This
subpart addresses hazards associated with the use of that gear. This would include such hazards as using faulty gear,
overloading or improperly rigging cargo gear, or improper operation of cargo gear, which can result in serious injury
or death. (See Ex. 1&hyph;103.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.51 contains general requirements that apply to all cargo handling equipment that is permanently attached
to a vessel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a) stipulates that the safe working load of the gear, whether marked on the lifting appliance
itself or specified in the required certificates/gear register, shall not be exceeded. Proposed paragraph (b) requires
that each component of ship's cargo handling gear be inspected by the employer before use, and at intervals during
use. This requirement is more clearly worded than the existing requirement by specifying the employer's obligation
to perform a visual inspection. Also, this new language more closely parallels the shoreside requirement found in
29 CFR 1917.42(a)(2). The paragraph also prohibits the use of unsafe gear. Proposed paragraph (c) provides criteria
for splicing wire rope and for wire rope configuration characteristics. Additionally, the paragraph conforms the
Longshore regulations to some current use criteria for wire rope that appear in OSHA's rules for the shoreside aspect
of marine cargo handling (Marine Terminals_29 CFR part 1917). Proposed paragraphs (d), (e), and (f), also parallel
the shore side rules. OSHA believes that the new language in this section enhances the safety of the worker in several
ways. In paragraph (c), new and more stringent requirements are proposed for wire rope that is part of the ship's cargo
handling gear. In addition, the new provisions (paragraphs (d), (e), and (f)) set replacement criteria for wire rope
slings, natural and synthetic fibre rope slings, synthetic web slings, chains and chain slings, none of which are
addressed by the existing standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.52, 1918.53, and 1918.54 and all address the subject of rigging and operating vessel's cargo handling
gear. By and large, the requirements of these sections are found in the existing rule. Some language modifications
have been made to enhance clarity. In addition, some paragraphs have new language that enhances the understanding
of the provision which promotes greater compliance and eases enforcement burdens. For example, proposed 1918.53(e)
adds to the existing reporting requirement of a defective winch, the following requirement ``... and the winch shall
not be used until the defect or malfunction is corrected.'' Similarly, paragraph (i) adds a monitoring requirement
during operation and (k) removes a feasibility exception based on design that is no longer necessary today due to technological
improvements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA wishes to raise the issue and solicit comment from the public regarding whether or not to delete 1918.52(b). This
paragraph addresses the use of chain topping lift stoppers and clamp type stoppers that are used to manually lower
and raise the boom. This method of topping the boom is a potentially dangerous operation and has been largely replaced
by the use of electric topping lift winches, which do not require the use of stoppers. However, OSHA understands that
as a result of the breakup of the Soviet Union, vessels which had not been allowed to sail into the U.S. because of restrictions
placed on Soviet bloc countries, are now calling on various ports of the United States. In some cases, these vessels
are old, and have types of cargo handling gear that had been largely replaced by more modern gear. In light of this occurrence,
OSHA solicits public comment on this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph has been added, 1918.54(a), that addresses the hazard associated with the poor practice of rigging
guys or preventers so that they chafe against other guys, preventers, or stays. This practice can cause the vessels's
cargo gear to fail as the chafing can cause the wires to separate. This can lead to serious injury or death as the gear
and cargo fall down on the deck or into the hold.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.55 covers deck cranes permanently affixed to a vessel. The existing rule only addresses one of the hazards_the
guarding of the swing radius. The new requirements more completely address the hazards encountered in the use of ship's
cranes. These rules become necessary due to the widespread replacement of winches and booms by ship's cranes on newer
vessels. In addition, the new provisions closely parallel similar shoreside requirements in part 1917 and other
OSHA crane standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section prohibits the use of cranes which develop a visible or known defect that impacts on its safe operation.
In addition, the operator's position must be well maintained, with good visibility provided through the operator
cab's glass. During cargo operations, areas that are within the swing radius of the body of revolving cranes and are
accessible to employees must be guarded to prevent an employee from being caught between the body of the crane and any
fixed structure, or between parts of the crane. Paragraph (c) of 1918.55 also addresses the danger of employees being
caught between shipboard gantry cranes, such as would be found on a LASH (Lighter aboard ship) vessel or a self contained
container ship, and fixed structures on deck along the path of the cranes travel. (Ex. 1&hyph;103, cases 26 and 27).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Crane brakes must be monitored throughout the workshift. If they are unable to hold the load, the crane must not be used.
If cranes are used in tandem, a designated person (see definitions) must direct the operation with special emphasis
on positioning, rigging and movement.

Subpart G_Cargo Handling Gear and Equipment Other than Ship's Gear
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Subpart G applies to all cargo handling gear utilized in cargo operations that is not part of the vessel (ship's
gear). Proposed 1918.61 is very broad in its coverage. In paragraph (a) it stipulates that all gear and equipment brought
aboard a vessel must be inspected before and during its use by the employer or a designated person to determine its condition.
If, upon inspection, an unsafe condition is found, the gear must not be used until deficiencies are corrected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b)(1) is carried over from the current longshore rules and requires that the Safe Working Load
(SWL) of the gear not be exceeded. Proposed paragraph (b)(2) is new. This paragraph requires the marking of the SWL
on special stevedoring gear with a safe working load (SWL) of over five short tons. OSHA believes that this is a basic
requirement (Ex. 1&hyph;151), and that most gear in use is already marked with the SWL on it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c), which is similar to the current language, stipulates that the weight of any article of stevedoring
gear that exceeds 2,000 pounds (1 short ton) must be plainly marked with the weight of that article before being hoisted
by the ship's gear. Examples of such stevedoring gear are container handling lifting frames and certain multi-point
engagement bridles. It is important to consider the weight of such articles when evaluating safe working loads of
the ship's cargo gear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is because the weight of the gear must be added to the weight of the load being lifted to determine the actual load,
which together cannot exceed the SWL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraphs (d) and (e) remain unchanged and address certification and certification procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (f) addresses special stevedoring gear fabricated of components that are not common, off-the-shelf
type items. For example, gear room constructed spreader bars for heavy lift cargo, special lifting devices for unique
pieces of cargo, or bar pallet bridles will have some components that are not marketed or purchased with a specific
cargo handling use in mind. Such certification must be performed in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) by an agency
accredited by the Department of Labor under 29 CFR part 1919 before being put into use. Also, all intermodal container
spreaders that are supplied by the stevedore for hoisting afloat shall be similarly inspected, tested, and certificated.
Special stevedoring gear with a SWL of five short tons or less can continue to be inspected and tested as a unit by a designated
person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is also proposing that all cargo handling gear covered by 1918.61(f) with a SWL greater than 5 short tons be inspected
and proof load tested every four years in accordance with the chart found in paragraph (f) of this section. This inspection
and proof load test may be done by an agency accredited by the U.S. Department of Labor under 29 CFR part 1919, or it can
be done by a designated person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change to the existing longshore regulations parallels similar requirements found in 29 CFR part 1917, Marine
Terminals. For consistency between the two parts, OSHA is proposing in this rulemaking, to change 1917.50(b)(5)
to reflect the 5 long ton exemption that is being proposed in 1918.61 and to require the periodic testing of special
stevedoring gear and container spreaders every four years by a designated person, shoreside as well as shipside.
OSHA feels that this will provide additional protection for those employees that use special stevedoring gear and
will eliminate any confusion that may currently exist by requiring special stevedoring gear with a SWL greater than
five long tons and spreaders supplied by the employer to be inspected, tested, and certificated whether it is used
by shore-based material handling equipment or by cargo handling gear afloat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.62 covers all miscellaneous gear that is not part of ship's gear, such as all slings, shackles, hooks,
blocks and pallets (loose gear), employed aboard a vessel for use in cargo handling operations. The hazards addressed
by this section are those generally associated with an employee's being struck by falling objects, i.e. dunnage,
gear or cargo, when the gear fails. The provisions in this section helps to assure that loose gear used in the longshoring
operation is both adequate in strength and size and in good enough condition to safely perform the operation. To foster
uniformity, the Agency proposes the same requirements for miscellaneous gear as required in shoreside cargo handling
at 29 CFR 1917.42. (See 46 FR 4194 and 48 FR 30895 for a full discussion of the rationale for these provisions.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA proposes a comprehensive system of tables (See Appendix II) that will be utilized in the event that manufacturer's
recommendations/certificates are not immediately available at the worksite for safe working load assessment.
The tables are primarily based on ASME B30.9&hyph;1990 (Slings), (Ex. 1&hyph;148), as well as requirements applying
to wire rope clips and shackles currently contained in the Agency's rules for Marine Terminals. It is OSHA's position
that the manufacturers's recommended use and safe working load criteria, given the wide universe of international
fabrication of all miscellaneous gear, are the most reliable factors to utilize in determining safe usage. However,
the Agency appreciates that certificates or manufacturers' use recommendations may not be instantly available
in certain circumstances. For instance, when inbound pre-slung drafts of cargo are ready for discharge at a given
port, certificates or use recommendations might not be found aboard the vessel. Because such pieces of miscellaneous
gear are not ``ship's gear,'' it is likely that no data on them will appear within the ship's collection of certificates.
Likewise, such gear cannot be properly classified as ``stevedore supplied gear,'' for the stevedore will not have
known the characteristics of the slings until the hatch section is actually observed. In these circumstances, the
tables found in Appendix II can be relied upon to provide a realistic safe working load.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with I.L.O. recommendation 160 (Ex. 1&hyph;8), OSHA, in proposed requirement 1918.62(h)(5)(ii),
has added wording to prohibit the use of wrought iron in new parts of lifting appliances or loose gear. As a practical
matter, wrought iron is rarely seen on vessels that are trading today. However, as with many of the regulations in this
rule that have reduced application, there is the possibility that such conditions may still exist, and for that reason
the relevant standards are being left in the proposal. OSHA invites the public to comment on this matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a new paragraph is proposed to be added, (g)(2)(vi), that adds an additional criterion to cause a synthetic
web sling to be removed from service. If warning threads or markers that the manufacturer has designed to indicate
excessive wear or damage are visible, than the sling must be removed from service. Proposed 1918.63 and 1918.64 provide
requirements for the use of chutes, rollers and both gravity and mechanically powered conveyors. OSHA proposes to
bring into part 1918 the requirements that cover such pieces of equipment within the shoreside (29 CFR 1917.48 and
1917.49) rules. In this manner, no regulatory disparity will exist with equipment that often physically originates
on shore and extends onto the ship. (See 46 FR 4208 and 48 FR 30900 for a full discussion of the rationale for these provisions
as adopted in the Marine Terminal standard.) Notable among the changes brought about by bringing those shoreside
rules aboard vessels, is the requirement that powered conveyors be locked out and tagged during most maintenance,
repair, and serving. Also, that same procedure would be required in most situations that require the removal of a jam
or overload on the powered conveyor system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.65 covers the use of all mechanically powered vehicles brought aboard vessels to conduct or assist
in cargo handling operations. Included in this category of equipment are all industrial trucks and all bulk cargo
moving vehicles. In that these same vehicles are similarly utilized in the shoreside aspect of marine cargo handling,
the hazards are essentially the same. These would include, among others, exceeding the safe working capacity of the
vehicle; cargo falling on the operator either from stowage on the vessel or from being handled by the vehicle itself;
improper maintenance which could lead to unsafe operation of the vehicle; and the falling hazards associated with
the lifting of personnel by mechanically powered vehicles. Therefore, OSHA has proposed to track the requirements
found in 1917.43 that are applicable to this class of equipment. (See 46 FR 4197 and 48 FR 30896 for a full discussion
of the rationale of these provisions as adopted in the Marine Terminal standard.) Additionally, the Agency is proposing
a requirement for roll-over protection on bulk cargo moving vehicles (such as the type used to trim and position bulk
cargo in underdeck spaces). Such protection is required on similar pieces of equipment used in construction industry
settings, where the hazard posed by turnover also exists. OSHA seeks comment on whether this provision provides adequate
protection shipside and whether similar protection is needed shoreside.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is proposing, in 1918.65(g), that vehicles purchased after the effective date of the final rule shall be equipped
with parking brakes. OSHA believes that, although most older equipment may not be equipped with parking brakes, equipment
that is currently being manufactured is generally equipped with such brakes. A parking brake is especially important
when working Ro-Ro type vessels where the ramps can have a steep grade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.66 covers all cranes and derricks which are not part of a vessel's permanent cargo handling gear, but
are placed aboard a vessel temporarily to conduct cargo operations. As an example, mobile and crawler type cranes
are at times positioned upon barges and thereupon transported to locations adjacent to a vessel to load and discharge
cargo. Given that these hoisting devices are identical at both the shoreside and shipboard location, the hazards
associated with the operation of this equipment are basically the same. These would include, among others, exceeding
the safe working capacity of the crane or derrick; improper operation; improper maintenance; exposed mechanical
moving parts; falling hazards associated with lifting personnel; and crushing hazards. Therefore, OSHA has relied
upon its rules for cranes and derricks found in 29 CFR 1917.45 to provide regulatory consistency to the marine cargo
handling industrial sector. (See 46 FR 4201 and 48 FR 30897 for a full discussion of the rationale of these provisions
as adopted in the Marine Terminal standard.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In one obvious departure from the foregoing principle, the Agency has chosen not to propose requirements for load
indicating devices within this section for shipside cargo handling. Usually such devices rely upon boom radius (outreach)
as a component determinant in arriving at a load indication. When afloat, however, boom radius can be compromised
by load and stability factors, resulting in indications that are not accurate. OSHA seeks comment from interested
persons as to whether this approach provides adequate safety. In addition, the Agency solicits comment on alternative
means of preventing overloads of cranes used aboard ships. Are there reliable alternate devices (that do not use radius
as a central component in arriving at a load indication) that are sufficiently developed to accurately indicate the
weight of the load? Would load moment indicators provide equal or better protection. Are some systems more precise
than others? What other procedures could be employed to prevent overload conditions?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, proposed 1918.66(c)(2) requires that the hoisting mechanism of cranes and derricks, when being used
to hoist personnel, shall operate in the power up and power down mode with automatic brake application when stopped.
This provision is similar to the requirements found in the personnel hoisting section of the OSHA Construction standards
at 29 CFR 1926.550(g)(ii)(D). Earlier OSHA had proposed such a rule for all cranes in the Marine Terminal Proposal
(46 FR 4237) but comments and other record evidence convinced OSHA that, at the time, this would be infeasible for mobile
cranes. The final Marine Terminal standard, promulgated in 1983, therefore, only applied this provision to overhead
and container gantry cranes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in 1988, OSHA issued its Construction standard for Crane or Derrick Suspended Personnel Platforms, (29
CFR 1926.550(g); 53 FR 29116). This rulemaking reexamined the feasibility of the controlled load lowering provision
and, based on the record evidence, OSHA determined that controlled load lowering was both feasible and necessary
when using cranes to hoist employees. For a detailed discussion, see 53 FR 29122.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these findings, OSHA is proposing to include the controlled load lowering provision in this part, and to
amend part 1917 (1917.45(j)(2)) to cover all cranes and derricks, including mobile cranes. OSHA wishes to emphasize
that hoisting employees by crane is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a safe practice and should be used only where other means are not feasible. OSHA solicits comment on this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.66(c)(3) is a new requirement has also been taken from the from OSHA's Construction Safety standards
applicable to hoisting personnel. This requires that a crane used to lift personnel be equipped with an anti-two block
device. This is a device which prevents the hoist block from coming into contact with the head block of the boom. Such
``two-blocking'' can occur when the operator is not paying attention to how high the hoist block is in relation to the
head of the boom. After contact, continued hoisting of the block can cause the block to separate from the load line,
or break the load line itself, causing the hoist block and load to fall. OSHA feels that this requirement is necessary
to prevent serious injury or death to employees being hoisted by a crane. In the 1988 construction rulemaking, this
requirement was also found to be both necessary and feasible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.67 carries over the exact requirements currently found in OSHA's Longshoring rule at 1918.75. Paragraphs
(a) and (b) both provide that the employer must obtain permission from the officer in charge of the vessel whenever
internal combustion or electrically powered tools, equipment or vehicles are brought aboard, and whenever the ship's
power is needed for operating the employer's electrical tools or equipment. These requirements are prudent, in that
such employer-provided equipment may be incompatible with vessel systems and could lead to electrical and ventilation
problems, among others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.68 provides for the effective grounding of all portable electrical equipment, such as saws, drills,
grinders, etc., through a separate equipment conductor that either runs with or encloses both circuit conductors.
This represents a clarification of the current rule. Double-insulated tools and battery-operated tools are excluded
from the requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.69 is a section titled ``Tools.'' The current requirements with the same title are found in 1918.72,
which addresses the safety devices that are required on portable tools, generally, and portable circular saws specifically.
OSHA believes that the current OSHA General Industry standards, subpart P, titled ``Hand and Portable Powered Tools
and Other Hand-Held Equipment'' comprehensively address the subject of portable tools. The hazards presented by
these tools in this industry are no different than in general industry. Rather than repeating these requirements
here, OSHA has decided to reference them in this proposal.

Subpart H_Handling Cargo
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Subpart H specifically covers the cargo handling process. These sections (1918.81&hyph;89) address the
hazards encountered by longshore workers while loading and unloading cargo. The primary hazards involve situations
where the employee falls or is struck by cargo during the operation. In this subpart, OSHA is proposing to retain many
of the rules currently found within subpart H of the current Longshoring standards (part 1918); to carry over applicable
regulatory language from the Agency's rules for the shoreside segment of marine cargo handling (part 1917); and to
add new requirements to account for occupational situations that are both unique to the shipboard workplace setting
and up to date in their coverage of intermodal transport systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1918.81 through 1918.84 address those hazards common to the handling of break bulk (or general) cargo. They
require proper slinging, building, bulling and stowing drafts of cargo in order to prevent cargo from coming loose
from the draft and falling on or tipping over on workers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a) of 1918.81 is a general requirement for safety in the hoisting of slung drafts (loads hoisted
by a sling or slings). Many factors can result in an unsafely slung draft. For instance, the wires of the sling may be
placed on or around the cargo in a manner that causes a load to become unstable once it is hoisted. Such a situation can
be recognized and effectively handled simply by rearranging the placement of the sling. Also, multi-tiered drafts
are sometimes hoisted in a very unstable condition that is caused by one tier resting off center of another. Even a slight
slacking of the gear can cause drafts slung in this manner to come apart. Readjustment of such drafts before hoisting
can easily remedy that unsafe condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) requires that slings attached to the lifting gear for handling more than one draft in succession
be positively engaged to the hoisting system. This is usually accomplished by shackling the bridle (or sling) directly
into the falls. Mousing (closing off) the throat of the cargo hook assembly, is not permitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (c) provides protection for a common hazard encountered in break bulk cargo operations; that
of being struck by sliding pieces of cargo or dunnage (shoring materials) that fall from the draft while in transit.
There are at least two ways to correct such a situation: the first is to reconfigure the sling so that the top layer of
the cargo is effectively engaged; the second is to secure the potential ``sliders'' to themselves (by banding them,
for instance) or to the more substantial part of the draft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraphs (d), (e), and (h) are virtually identical to the current rules but are modified somewhat for clarity.
Proposed paragraphs (f) and (g), on the other hand, are derived from the Marine Terminal standard which address the
hoisting of ``unitized loads.'' Unitized loads are loads that are banded or strapped together into a unit. Hoisting
hazards with such loads occur when the bands are used to hoist the load but were not designed to do so; and when hoisting
is performed when the banding is damaged. (See full discussion at 46 FR 4189.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (i) requires that loads not be hoisted unless the crane or winch operator can clearly see the draft
at all times, or, alternatively, can clearly see the signals given by a signal person who is observing the draft. This
is particularly important in that many break bulk vessels in current use and under construction are being fitted with
revolving deck cranes. When using booms rigged in union purchase (the rigging of two booms together to be used as one
lifting unit) the position of the boom head (and thus the location of the load's ultimate place of landing) is pre-determined,
rarely changed, and fairly reliable. By contrast, in using deck cranes, the position of the boom bead can be varied
easily. Loads, therefore, can be landed at many more locations, causing increased exposure of personnel to being
struck by loads. Effective signaling requires a clear observation of the load by the signalperson and of the signalperson
by the operator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (k) provides that the employer must require employees to stay clear of the area beneath overhead
drafts or descending lifting gear. The employer is obligated to train certain employees in correct and safe procedures
associated with the job, and to require that employees adhere to the well established and enforced work rules that
are contained in that training. (See full discussion at 46 FR 4194.) OSHA is also proposing to include the same language
in the Marine Terminal standard in 1917.13(h).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (l) prohibits riding of the load or the cargo engaging means. This precludes the utilization of
any cargo or any cargo engaging device (hook, clamshell, grapple, etc.) as a personnel conveyance. This proposed
paragraph does not cover, however, the riding of loaded intermodal container spreaders, which is addressed in 1918.85(g).
In accordance with proposed 1918.23(b), specific latitude is afforded longshoring operations taking place on the
Mississippi river system, where the use of a personnel basket may be used. However, careful consideration and consultation
with the Agency is important in the exercise of that latitude.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.82 and 1918.83 (a) and (b) address the hazards of cargo becoming inadvertently dislodged from an improperly
built draft or improper stowage and falling or shifting, thus striking workers. The language is virtually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identical to the current longshore rule. 1918.83(c), however, addresses a different hazard_losing workers in the
hold of a ship. Such a hazard is greatly enhanced when the worker is working alone or in an isolated area, such as in tanks
or reefer compartments. Also, workers trimming grain could be lost in the cargo. To deal with these hazards, the proposed
and current rules require an employee check-in, check-out system or frequent checks thereby accounting for the safety
of employees working in these conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.84 addresses the ``bulling'' of cargo. Bulling is the horizontal dragging of cargo (across a deck space)
with none of the weight of the cargo supported by the hoisting wire(s). In practice, this procedure is accomplished
with power generally provided by the cargo winch (with the hoist runner led out through the heel block), and then to
an angled system of ``fairleads'' that provide mechanical advantage in achieving a horizontal pull on the cargo.
The paragraphs that comprise this section are all taken from the current part 1918 regulations, but have been somewhat
clarified and reordered into a more logical sequence. They are also covered (in part) within the NYSA-ILA Safety Code
(Ex. 1&hyph;2) and the PCMSC (Ex. 1&hyph;145).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.85 applies to containerized cargo operations of any form. The proposed paragraphs track both the current
Longshoring standards of part 1918, as well as the shoreside requirements found in the Marine Terminals rule (part
1917). In summary, each intermodal container (see definition at 1918.2(h)) must be marked with its gross, net, and
tare (empty) weights. Generally, containers must be weighed 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
before
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 being hoisted aboard a vessel, to arrive at an actual gross weight. No container is permitted to be hoisted aboard a
vessel if its actual gross weight exceeds either the maximum gross weight marked on the container or the safe working
load of the gear that is being utilized to load the ship. In the case of containers coming from foreign ports, container
weights must be determined by utilizing data provided in shipping documents or, as is most often the case, by weights
shown on cargo stow plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) addresses the topic of overloaded intermodal containers. This issue has raised a good deal
of international concern (Exs. 1&hyph;120, 1&hyph;121, 1&hyph;122, 1&hyph;123, 1&hyph;124, 1&hyph;125, 1&hyph;126).
The proposed provisions largely reflect the current rules in both the Longshore and Marine Terminal standards. OSHA
feels that the protection afforded by its rules as they pertain to outbound (export) containers, namely that with
few exceptions all are weighed before hoisting, will permit very few overweight loads going out from U.S. ports. The
reliability of manifested or stow plan weights of containers coming into U.S. ports, however, appears to be in serious
question as documented by the previous exhibits. The question then becomes, whether there is a better method of determining
the actual weights of these containers, and how should such a method be implemented in the standards. The Agency requests
interested persons to submit comment into the record concerning both as to the Agency's perception of the problem,
and what better regulatory approach OSHA may take in seeking resolution. For instance, instead of relying upon the
proposed language of this section, should OSHA require that container handling gantry cranes (currently exempted
from the rule requiring a load indicating device_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1918.74(a)(9)(viii)) be fitted with such a piece of equipment? In addition, a new proposed 1918.85(b)(6) has been
added as a result of OSHA Instruction STD 2.2 dated July 3, 1989 (Ex. 1&hyph;114). Prior to the issuance of this instruction,
the rule required closed containers loaded only with automobiles to be weighed. This instruction (and the language
of this paragraph) allows closed dry van containers that have been loaded with vehicles to be loaded onto a vessel without
being weighed on a scale. By contrast, other loaded containers, other than open top containers and containers solely
used for the carriage of compressed gases, have to be weighed on a scale before being loaded onto a vessel. The reasoning
behind the Instruction and this paragraph is that the weight of the vehicles inside a container will not exceed the
net weight that the container itself is designed to carry. There are, however, three conditions that must be met in
order for this exception to apply. First, the container must only contain assembled vehicles and no other cargo; second,
the container must be marked on the outside so that an employee can readily discern that the container is carrying vehicles;
and finally, the vehicles must have been loaded at the marine terminal. This paragraph is also to be proposed to be put
into the Marine Terminal standard as 29 CFR 1917.71(b)(6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (d) addresses the hazard of handling a defective container. Although existing 1918.85(d) addresses
the inspection of both outbound and inbound containers for visible defects, the proposed language does not mention
the limitation of outbound or inbound. With regard to outbound containers, the hazards associated with handling
a defective container are effectively covered by 1917.71(g) of the Marine Terminal standard. In this paragraph,
OSHA chooses not to limit the inspection requirement to only inbound containers since certain other containers,
including possibly defective ones, may need to be shifted in order to discharge an inbound container. Since a defective
outbound container can create an identical hazard to the worker as does a defective inbound container, this proposal
makes no distinction between the two. Finally, the provisions for handling a defective container remain the same
as the current requirements: special safe handling or emptying of the container.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposed paragraph (e), the Agency would require that employees be required to stay clear of the area beneath suspended
containers. Accidents of an extremely serious nature have occurred in recent years (Ex. 1&hyph;37, 1&hyph;87) that
highlight the need to propose this provision. Additionally, the Agency has such a requirement in its shoreside rules
(1917.71(d)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (f) on lifting fittings contains identical language to that found in the Agency's shoreside rules
(1917.71(f)). Discussion is warranted, however, on the need to apply paragraph (f)(1)(i) on board ships. Often,
particularly in below deck stowage on conventional break bulk vessels, it may be tempting to utilize ship's gear or
shoreside mobile cranes and rig four leg bridles with hooks (engaging the four top corner castings) to facilitate
easier stowage. In handling loaded containers, this practice is dangerous and is prohibited. The International
Cargo Handling Coordination Association (ICHCA), has published a paper entitled ``The Safe Handling of ISO Freight
Containers with Hooks *&blank;*&blank;*&sect;'' that clearly outlines the inherent dangers of this practice (Ex.
1&hyph;13) as well as methods to accomplish stowage safely in such situations. Additionally, other international
standards exist (Exs. 1&hyph;115, 1&hyph;116 and 1&hyph;117) that recommend that loaded containers only be lifted
vertically when being handled from the top. Any method of lifting containers that is not vertical places undue stress
which could lead to failure of the container. OSHA believes that this regulatory approach is well taken and reasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposed paragraph (g), the Agency requires that a safe means of access and egress be provided to each employee who,
due to the nature of the work, must work atop stowed containers_both above and below deck. In practice, most employees
gain such access by riding aboard safety platforms installed on container crane lifting frames. Such means are permissible
when conducted in a manner consistent with design requirements found in the shoreside rules (1917.45(j)). While
the shoreside rules already apply whenever a shore-based crane acts as the personnel conveyance, this proposed paragraph
(which incorporates by reference the shoreside design criteria) provides for the same requirements to apply whenever
shipboard equipment carries out the same function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (h) applies on vessels so equipped, to any loaded intermodal container spreader. It is well known
throughout the industry that there are significant risks associated with riding a loaded container spreader. ``Free
falls'' (or the unintended release of a container from a spreader), although infrequent, occur only while under load
(Exs. 1&hyph;25 and 1&hyph;26). Additionally, having riders aboard a loaded spreader adds to the responsibilities
of the crane operator, and whose attention is already occupied with the task of getting the containers to their intended
location. The Agency is proposing a similar prohibition for the shoreside aspect of marine cargo handling (part 1917)
as part of this proposal, proposed 1917.45(j)(9).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposed paragraph (i), OSHA would require (when safer methods are available) that ladders not be used to gain access
to the tops of containers that are stowed greater than two high. The Agency deems gaining access by means of a properly
designed and conveyed personnel platform (such as those often found on intermodal container spreaders) as being
safer than employing ladders in climbing to heights that can attain 50. ft or more (Ex. 1&hyph;10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (j) covers the hazard of falling from the tops of intermodal containers. This hazard has long been
recognized by the stevedoring industry as both extremely dangerous and difficult to prevent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although constituting a small percentage of the total number of shipboard accidents in the United States, falls from
the tops of containers have resulted in a number of serious occupational injuries and fatalities (Exs. 1&hyph;18,
1&hyph;19, 1&hyph;20, 1&hyph;21, 1&hyph;22, 1&hyph;23, 1&hyph;24, 1&hyph;43, 1&hyph;67, 1&hyph;68, 1&hyph;100,
1&hyph;108). As early as 1968, U.S. terminal operators recognized the need to improve container top safety. Matson
Terminals, Inc., in conjunction with their parent ocean operator, Matson Navigation Company, developed the first
system of container top fall protection within the worldwide intermodal network (Ex. 1&hyph;53). In that system,
Matson provided for a ``D'' ring fixture to be installed within the roof of each company-owned intermodal container.
Employees working aloft were provided with a safety belt and lanyard that could be secured to the ``D'' ring anchorage.
For a number of reasons, use of the system proved to be difficult, and it is not widely used today.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1970, OSHA's predecessor agency, the Bureau of Labor Standards, was contacted by the Coast Labor Relations Committee
of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, who raised this issue specifically. In their letter
of August 24, 1970 (Ex. 1&hyph;50), the Coast Committee asserted:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Consider if you will the dangers attendant to working atop containers. They are not equipped with skidproof surfaces,
there are no protective railings, and there are no requirements that safety belts be provided. In dry warm weather
such work is dangerous enough, but the dangers are critically compounded when workers must labor atop these during
windy and wet weather. At the very least, BLS regulations ought to provide that *&blank;*&blank;* safety belts be
[required] for men working aloft.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the containerized transport revolution progressed during the 1970's and into the 1980's, and intermodal containers
become more common in the cargo handling trades, container top exposures increased proportionately. At that time,
there was no specific container top safety provision in the Longshoring standards. The Agency issued citations under
the General Duty Clause (Section 5(a)(190) of the Act and 1918.32(b) of OSHA's rules for Longshoring (Exs. 1&hyph;139).
The latter provision states, in the context of applying to stowed cargo and temporary landing platforms:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When the edge of a hatch section or stowed cargo more than 8 feet high is so exposed that it presents a danger of an employer
falling, the edge shall be guarded by a safety net of adequate strength to prevent injury to a falling employee, or by
other means protection equal protection under the existing circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although there were questions regarding the applicability of 1918.32(b) to container operations, it was determined
that the provision did indeed have application to container top on-deck exposures. In an Instruction to the Field
(CPL 2&hyph;1.17) dated August 30, 1982, the Agency's policy on the issue was spelled out (Ex. 1&hyph;49). In that
instruction, OSHA determined that although the 1918.32(b) provision applied, there would be situations where the
abatement of the container fall hazard was not feasible. In such situations, the instruction noted:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A violation (of 1918.32(b)) shall not be issued; however, OSHA should recommend and encourage the employer to work
toward a solution and assist the employer in every way possible to effect a means of protection by advice, consultation
and dissemination of information obtained during other inspections.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the onset of containerized cargo handling, it became necessary to secure containers (not placed in cell guides)
to each other to prevent unintentional movement during transit. To achieve this stability, workers placed stacking
cones in the corner castings of the container (``coning'') while the containers were being loaded on the ship. While
the containers were unloaded from the ship, workers removed stacking cones from the corner castings of the container
(``deconing''). The original stacking cones were replaced in the early 1970's by conventional twistlocks which
eliminated the need for some lashing but still required workers to climb on top of the containers to place or remove
them. Today twistlocks are the most commonly used fitting for securing freight containers onboard vessels (Ex. 1&hyph;140).
Semi-automatic twistlocks, developed in the mid 1980's, eliminate the need for some lashing but also eliminate the
need for workers to go on top of the containers for the purposes of coning and deconing. While some work performed on
container tops remains unaffected by the use of SATLs, most of the work that would otherwise require workers to go atop
containers could be eliminated. The use of these devices could, effectively, ``engineer out'' exposure to container
top falling hazards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry efforts to find feasible methods for container top fall hazard abatement received a significant impetus
when, on June 27, 1985, Longshore Division members of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union
(ILWU) called a work stoppage that put at a standstill all container operations at the ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach, California. The work stoppage (Ex. 1&hyph;42) punctuated the ILWU's concern over a series of work related
deaths that occurred over a 14-month period. Although only one of these occupational fatalities was attributable
to container top exposure, the labor union insisted that an effective work rule to minimize the hazards associated
with container top work be instituted, and asserted that such a work rule was central to averting a continued work stoppage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 1, 1985, the ILWU and the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), acting as management's representative, agreed
upon a package of 25 work rules that were specifically designed to enhance safety at container terminals. That successful
management and labor agreement led to the resumption of work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internationally, a number of national and multi-national organizations are aware of and have acted upon the problem.
The International Labor Organization, in its Code of Practice for Safety and Health in Dockwork (Ex. 1&hyph;130)
specifically requires that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A person gaining access to the top of a container should be adequately protected against the danger of falling where

provides, in pertinent part, that:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

In the port of Hamburg, Germany, a ``lash basket'' designed by a dockworker (Ex. 1&hyph;45) rides underneath the container
spreader and moves between container stows, minimizing containertop exposures. Also, in the port of Bremerhaven,
a specially designed ``rigger box,'' which is similar in configuration to some U.S. designs, protects dockworkers
who go on top of containers in that port (Ex. 1&hyph;52).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the wake of a fatal accident that occurred in a New Zealand port in 1979, the New Zealand section of ICHCA responded
by conducting and publishing a study, entitled: ``Container Top Safety_An Overview'' (Ex. 1&hyph;46). In that study,
ICHCA analyzed the problem and a number of possible solutions, among them having the employee tethered to a fixed anchorage.
Other tentative solutions arrived at by a number of worldwide locales were also discussed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that longshore workers who work on container tops are exposed to fall hazards that can cause serious
injury or death. Containers are typically stacked from one to nine below deck and one to six above deck. The loading
and unloading procedures typically require a worker to place and remove container stacking alignment cones in and
from the container's corner castings. This means that workers performing these tasks are regularly exposed to falling
hazards of up to 90 feet (27.3 m).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the last few years, advances have been made in the technology of securing intermodal containers which have
had a dramatic effect on container top safety. The use of positive container securing devices or systems, such as semi-automatic
twistlocks (SATL) and above deck cell guides, can nearly eliminate the need for workers to work on the tops of containers
thereby eliminating the falling hazard. Although OSHA has participated in an ongoing dialogue with industry, labor,
the international cargo handling community, and others interested in how these technologies can improve worker
safety, actual record evidence is somewhat limited. However, OSHA's information does include a comprehensive study
prepared by a safety expert under contract to OSHA that addresses the hazards associated with containerized cargo
handling (Ex. 1&hyph;139); an ICHCA Safety Panel Research Paper addressing the use of semi-automatic twistlocks
(Ex. 1&hyph;140); a time-and-motion study comparing the use of conventional twistlocks (also referred to as manual
twistlocks) with semi-automatic twistlocks (Ex. 1&hyph;141); safety information produced by the United Kingdom
(U.K.) addressing jammed container fittings (Ex. 1&hyph;142); an article published by a U.K. terminal association
that addresses the freeing of jammed twistlocks (Ex. 1&hyph;143); and a newsletter from an insurance company addressing
container twistlocks (Ex. 1&hyph;144).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ICHCA study is the most comprehensive study on the SATL experience (Ex. 1&hyph;140). This study defines SATL at

Since prototypes were first developed in Japan in the mid 1980's, manufacturers around the world have made improvements
on the design which enhance both durability and reliability. (Id.) In fact, the ICHCA study indicates the existence
of approximately 22 different models of SATLs (Id. P. 6). Manufacturers indicate that, with proper use and maintenance,
the average lifespan of the SATL in the marine environment would be about the same as a conventional twistlock_about
10 years (Id. p. 59). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in both the ICHCA study (Id.) and the OSHA study (Ex. 1&hyph;139), the use of SATLs is widespread throughout
the world and the United States. In fact, OSHA estimates that over 25 percent of ships calling in U.S. ports are already
utilizing SATLs. Proponents of the use of SATLs argue that the device avoids accidents and saves money. Unlike conventional
twistlocks, which must be inserted by workers on top of the container and manually locked, semi-automatic twistlocks
are inserted into the bottom of the container by workers standing on the dock and lock automatically when placed upon
another container. Both SATLs and conventional twistlocks can be unlocked by workers standing on the deck of the ship
using an actuator pole. In the case of unloading with the conventional twistlock, the upper container is then removed
leaving the twistlocks on the top of the lower container. The major operational distinction is that workers must remove
conventional twistlocks from the top of a shipboard container before the spreader can attach to the corner castings,
while the SATL is designed to remain attached to the bottom of the container being unloaded. SATLs are then removed
by workers standing on the dock. This operation using SATLs, therefore, eliminates worker exposure to falling hazards.
Finally, proponents argue that the use of SATLs enhances productivity and reduces lashing costs. (Ex. 1&hyph;140,
p. 76; Ex. 1&hyph;141). In fact, a time-and-motion study that compares the performance of conventional twistlocks
to that of SATLs indicates an increase in productivity in the range of 25 to 29 percent. This translates to a 11.1 percent
reduction in stevedoring costs (Ex. 1&hyph;141, p. 4 and 5; Ex. 2). To the extent that this study is representative
of all container cargo handling operations affected by this rule, it indicates substantial reductions of fall hazards
by the use of SATLs. OSHA seeks comment from interested parties including any additional data or studies that address
this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, another advancement in securing containers in transit that eliminates the need for workers to
go on top of containers is the development of above deck cell guides. Cell guides are rigid, structural members that
form cells where containers are stowed. These cell guides allow for the ready placement of containers in a manner that
prevents movement once so placed. Although cell guides in the hold are common in container ships, above deck cell guides
are far less common, constituting only 2 percent (Ex. 2, pgs. 2&hyph;19) of container ships calling at U.S. ports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, OSHA is aware of the existence of positive container securing devices other than those discussed above,
such as the SeaLand framing system (Ex. 1&hyph;57), OSHA believes that use of the term ``positive container securing
devices'' is broad enough to allow for innovative technological improvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the use of SATLs is the most widespread method of positively securing containers that eliminates the fall hazard,
OSHA is aware of certain problems that have been encountered with their application, use and design. (Ex. 1&hyph;140,
1&hyph;142, 1&hyph;143,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1&hyph;144). The Agency is working closely with those international standards setting organizations responsible
for developing design and use specifications. In this rulemaking, OSHA solicits relevant information regarding
the use of SATLs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.85(j) addresses the hazards associated with working on the tops of containers. In keeping with OSHA's
hierarchy of controlling hazards, this paragraph requires the use of feasible engineering controls. In proposed
paragraph (j)(1) a definition for ``fall hazard'' is provided in a footnote. The definition seeks to narrow the elevated
work surfaces where fall hazards exist in order to reflect the reality of a changing work surface. A longshore worker
working on the top of containers for the purpose of loading or unloading a layer of containers is working on an elevated
work surface that can increase or decrease at the rate of 320 square feet (29.4 m2) every few minutes. OSHA believes
that such a rapidly changing elevated work surface is unique to this industry. For example, five 40-foot containers
stowed side by side present a work surface of approximately 40 foot (12.2 m) by 40 foot (12.2 m) (1600 square feet)(147.2
m2). According to this definition, falling hazards (absent weather considerations) only exist within 3 feet (.92
m) of the perimeter or 3 feet (.9 m) by 148 feet (45.1 m) (444 square feet) (40.8 m2). By contrast, the hazardous area on
top of a single container is 252 square feet (23.4 m2) of the 320 square feet (29.4 m2). The definition makes it clear
that it is the unprotected edge where the hazard exists, and not necessarily the entire work surface. Additionally,
any gap of 12 inches (.31 m) or more on a horizontal surface formed by containers is considered an unprotected edge and
a falling hazard would exist under this definition. (For further discussion of the gap issue see 51 FR 42685 and 53 FR
48186). Finally, OSHA believes that any work within 3 feet (.92 m) of the unprotected edge constitutes a hazard (See
Ex. 1&hyph;139).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another important element of this definition is the vertical distance necessary to constitute a fall hazard. OSHA
believes that, in this industry and in this work operation, 10 feet (3.0 m) is the appropriate vertical distance. There
are several considerations that leads OSHA to this conclusion. The height of the overwhelming majority of intermodal
containers range from 8 feet (2.4 m) to 91/2 feet (2.7 m) (Ex. 1&hyph;139). Therefore, an employee working on top of
a one-high container where the surface is less then 10 feet (3.04 m) would not, by definition, be exposed to a fall hazard.
However, such containers are usually worked off ladders, not the top. Also, if such a container is stowed on a raised
surface, such as a hatch cover or pedestal, that puts the top of the container at 10 feet or over, then any workers on top
would, by definition, be exposed to fall hazards. The unique working surface in this operation coupled with heightened
awareness of the longshore worker and the absence of accident data at this distance further assures OSHA that 10 foot
is the appropriate height.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is aware that an opposing view exists. Labor is of the opinion that OSHA should make this vertical height 8 feet
(2.4 m) to be consistent with the proposed requirement 1918.32(b) where a fall hazard is considered to exist over 8
feet (2.4 m) when handling non-containerized cargo (Ex. 1&hyph;150). OSHA wishes to fully assess all factors attendant
to this issue, and solicits all pertinent views and data on the appropriate height for fall protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two final considerations in the definition of a fall hazard are with regard to the elements and the ``adjoining surface.''
When weather conditions are such that the vision or footing of workers on top of containers is impaired then a fall hazard
will, by definition, exist. The proposed standard requires such workers to be protected by fall protection, regardless
of the fall distance or their proximity to the edge. OSHA notes that unsure footing on container top work surfaces created
by oil or grease is addressed in the housekeeping section, 1918.91, of this proposed standard. In addition, in the
Marine Terminal standard, OSHA defers to adverse weather conditions by prohibiting terminal crane operations in
high-wind conditions (1917.45(g)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other consideration involves the measurement of the vertical distance from ``the adjoining surface.'' Informal
discussions between OSHA staff and various affected parties have indicated concern that this phrase must be carefully
defined in order to avoid confusion in the maritime community. An enforcement concern is a that vertical height measurement
might be made from the elevated surface to an adjoining surface which would not be the landing surface in the event of
a fall. Should the term, ``adjoining surface'' be further clarified by adding either performance or specification
language? For example, the term could read, ``adjoining landing surface (in the event of a fall)''; or ``adjoining
surface with a minimum 8 by 8-foot area (2.4 m by 2.4 m).'' OSHA solicits comment on this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the recent technological improvements in positive container securing devices indicated above, OSHA feels
that many work operations, notably coning and deconing, that exposed workers to container top fall hazards can now
be eliminated. As noted above, SATLs have proven to be particularly effective when container gantry cranes are utilized
(Ex. 1&hyph;140). In fact, the use of these devices in these circumstances can, in most instances, eliminate the need
for workers to go on top of containers. In light of this, three years after the date of publication of this proposal,
proposed 1918.85(j)(1) would prohibit the performance of any work, notably coning and deconing, on top of containers
that can be eliminated by the proper use of these devices. OSHA has estimated that over 25 percent of ships calling at
U.S. ports already utilize SATLs (Ex. 2). Since it is OSHA's policy to allow a reasonable time to come into compliance
with final standards, the proposed compliance date for the implementation of engineering controls would be three
years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is optimistic that exposures to container top fall hazards will significantly decrease with the expanded deployment
of positive container securing devices worldwide. At the same time, the Agency is sensitive to the magnitude of a phase-in
process for SATLs. Consequently, OSHA is proposing a lengthy effective date of this section of three years from the
date the proposed standard is issued. Consonant also with the Agency's policy, OSHA will continue to disseminate
information to employers and employees in this industrial sector, as to how other operations throughout the nation
and the world are approaching the problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA recognizes that positive container securing devices will not entirely eliminate the need for workers to go on
the top of containers. Certain container placement or securing tasks, in addition to coning or deconing, must be performed.
In these situations (e.g., securing bridge clamps or releasing jammed twistlocks), a comprehensive fall protection
program must be implemented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where cranes other than container gantry cranes are used to handle containers, OSHA recognizes that the use of SATLs
may not be feasible. Precise placement capabilities of a container gantry crane are far superior to other lifting
devices, thus facilitating the use of SATLs. This enhanced capability is due to the four point suspension system of
the gantry crane, which provides greater stability and control of the container being handled, enabling the crane
operator to place the container without assistance. Container operations where the spreader is suspended from a
single point, on the other hand, have far less stability and control and typically requires the assistance of other
employees in the placement of containers. In these circumstances, employees can frequently be exposed to fall hazards.
In light of the discussion above, even when the use of SATLs is feasible when other than gantry cranes are being utilized,
the need for employees to work on container tops in the handling of containers may not be eliminated. Therefore, OSHA
would not require the use of positive container securing devices when containers are not being handled by container
gantry cranes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, there is nothing in the proposed standard that would prohibit an employer from employing SATLs where
a single point suspension is in use. However, under these circumstances, SATLs in the container being placed have
been shown to jam or puncture the top of the container below with improper alignment (Ex. 1&hyph;140). OSHA solicits
all pertinent views and information on all issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the feasibility of fall protection, OSHA recognizes that, in this industry, there may be particular
instances when even fall protection may not be feasible. An example of circumstances where fall protection may not
be feasible is the placement of an overheight container on a chimney stow using gear that requires the manual release
of hooks. In these situations the proposed standard requires the employer to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Make a determination that an employee will be exposed to a fall hazard but that the use of fall protection is not feasible;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Alert the exposed employee about the hazards involved; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Instruct the exposed employee how to best minimize the hazard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA wishes to emphasize that such a situation is not common and that when they occur, the burden is on the employer to
fully comply with these requirements prior to the actual exposure. In fact, the OSHA study indicated that a ``specific
set of circumstances could not be framed'' where fall protection might not be feasible (Ex. 1&hyph;139, p. 1). Furthermore,
situations that will be considered infeasible for fall protection will be narrowly construed in the enforcement
context. A footnote in the standard refers to non-mandatory Appendix III which provides examples of situations where
it may be considered infeasible to use fall protection. Where feasible, however, OSHA will require that fall protection
be provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.85(k) establishes the technical requirements necessary to provide a fall protection system that
is tailored to the handling of containers. Most of the requirements in this paragraph are basic to any occupationally
related fall protection system. These include all of the paragraphs with the exception of (k)(7) and (k)(10), and
are based on the PCMSC (Ex. 1&hyph;145), American National Standards Institute (ANSI) consensus standard Z359.1&hyph;1992
and the OSHA standards 1910.66 and 1926.104. Essentially, these requirements address the design, selection, care
and proper use of a personal fall protection system. In addition, 1918.85(k)(7) and (10) have been specially crafted
for the container top situation. Paragraph (k)(7) addresses the situation where a container gantry crane, or its
extension, is being used as the anchorage point for the fall protection system in use. Under these circumstances,
the crane must be placed in the slow speed mode and equipped with a remote shut-off switch in the control of the tied off
employee. In addition, an indicator must be present to inform the employee when the remote is operational. OSHA seeks
comment on whether the indicator should reflect that both the slow speed mode and the remote shut-off are operational.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other proposed requirement unique to this work operation, paragraph (k)(10), addresses the situation where
the employee is being transported by a device, such as a safety cage, attached to a container gantry crane spreader.
Such a device is required to have a means of attachment to the spreader in place in addition to the primary attachment
mechanism of the spreader (hydraulic twistlock mechanism) to prevent accidental disengagement. OSHA is aware of
several instances where accidental disengagement of a load has occurred (Ex. 1&hyph;25, 1&hyph;26). This secondary
means of attachment is intended to minimize the potential for injury if accidental disengagement were to occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final issue for discussion in this section is Paragraph (k)(13) where an employee retrieval procedure in the case
of a fall must be established. It has been suggested that local emergency response personnel be consulted in the development
of this procedure in order to assure that rescue or retrieval efforts do not exacerbate any injury. OSHA believes that
such a consultation would be prudent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA invites comment on all issues related to container top safety and encourages the submission of relevant views
and information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.85(l) addresses container operations that require employees to work along unguarded edges other
than on container tops. In these situations, fall protection meeting the requirements of paragraph (k) of this section
must be provided where the fall distance is greater than 8 feet (2.4 m). This primarily addresses work operations such
as lashing or locking and unlocking twist locks from other surfaces, or signalling to direct the placement of containers.
Frequently, this work operation requires employees to work in elevated positions that remove the fall protection
that would have normally been provided by the ship's coaming or railings. OSHA recently investigated a fatality where
an employee fell 34 feet (10.3 m) from a lashing platform that was inadequately guarded (Ex. 1&hyph;149).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.86 is a new section that addresses operations aboard vessels that accommodate Ro-Ro (Roll-on/Roll-off)
traffic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emergence of Ro-Ro vessels is a fairly recent development and were not addressed in the current rules. Along with
container operations, this section proposes new provisions that address advances in modern technology in the marine
cargo handling industry. Examples of such vessels are car carriers, which facilitate the import and export automobile
trades, and stern or side port combination carriers, which provide water carriage for wheel mounted as well as containerized
cargo. Commonly such vessels are fitted with ramps that extend to the dock or wharf, and are fitted with ramps internally
or, alternatively, are fitted with cargo elevators (lifts). In this manner, cargo is either driven through the vessel
from deck to deck until reaching its final stowage location, or hoisted by cargo elevator to its proper deck and then
driven to its final stowage location. Once positioned in its stowage location, the wheeled cargo is lashed to securing
fittings that are provided on the deck. In such operations, lashing personnel are exposed to being struck by vehicular
traffic. In addition, other workers involved with loading or unloading wheeled cargo, both drivers and pedestrians,
are exposed to traffic hazards. OSHA is aware of a number of accidents (Ex. 1&hyph;78, 1&hyph;89) that are attributable
to this process, wherein employees are interspersed with vehicles in a closely confined, marginally illuminated
and poorly traffic managed space.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposed paragraph (a), OSHA would require an organized system of traffic control to be established and maintained
at each entrance and exit ramp. The confluence of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in Ro-Ro operations, and thus the
area where substantial accident potential is most pronounced, is the area on and around access ramps. With this mode
of cargo carriage on the increase, accident potential is expected to increase proportionately. Ramps inside the
vessel, although generally not as congested as ship-to-shore access lanes, must also be addressed by the traffic
control system if they experience a periodic traffic flow that warrants such control. In developing this rule, OSHA
considered positions taken by the International Labor Organization in their Code of Practice for Dock Work (Ex. 1&hyph;106),
which provides that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A system of movement control of vehicles used in loading and unloading ships should be effectively and continuously
applied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In assessing other national requirements, the Agency found that Sweden in its Dock Work Directions issued by the National
Board of Occupational Safety and Health (Ex. 1&hyph;136), also requires that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A traffic guard shall be stationed wherever motor vehicles need to be directed, e.g., on roll on-roll off ramps, narrow
wharves and places where there is traffic crossing and the view is limited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Clearly, shipside traffic control is just as necessary as it is in the shoreside environment. In OSHA's preamble to
the Marine Terminals standard, the Agency emphasized (46 FR 4200) in its assessment of the importance of traffic control
at the shoreside marine terminal setting:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* the importance of these practices to employee safety cannot be over estimated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given the close relationship between shoreside and shipboard vehicular utilization, it is appropriate that OSHA's
rules addressing the two be complementary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) addresses the hazard of exceeding the capacity of the ramp used to transfer cargo. As a result
of ramp failure, the likely injury to occur is drowning or being crushed in the vehicle. Ramps must be plainly marked
with their load capacity and these capacities must not be exceeded (Ex. 1&hyph;5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (c) provides protection for employees that use the ship's ramp for access. In such situations,
OSHA proposes that a physical separation, i.e., a barrier, be provided to separate the employee and the vehicles.
Often vessels are fitted out in this manner (Ex. 1&hyph;84). However, should it be the case that a particular vessel
is not so fitted, it is a matter that is easily rectified. When the design of the ramp prevents physical separation of
pedestrians from vehicles, a signalperson shall direct traffic, and shall not allow concurrent use. Additionally,
OSHA proposes to require that such ramps utilized for pedestrian access be fitted out in the same manner as would a traditional
pedestrian gangway (see 1918.21).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (d) requires that ramps be properly maintained and secured. This is consistent with 1918.24(b)
which addresses maintaining and securing portable ramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (e) recognizes that in many of the modern generations of Ro-Ro vessels, internal ramps are elevatable.
Such a construction feature allows for multiple access destinations, depending upon the placement of the ramp. If
a ramp is placed in such a manner as to allow access to a given deck, thereby creating a void in another access route (that
could perhaps lead to a substantial drop or fall), this paragraph provides that the incomplete route be clearly identified
and barricaded. OSHA has investigated at least one (Ex. 1&hyph;86) occupational fatality in which this circumstance
was apparent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f) requires that all brake air lines be connected and tested prior to commencing operations. The proper
operation of brakes is necessary when operating inside a Ro-Ro vessel that typically has ramps with steep grades.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (g) requires that flat bed and low boy trailers be marked with their cargo capacity and not be overloaded.
These operations typically employ the use of trailers not designed for over-the-road use such as low boy trailers
(sometimes referred to as ``mafi's'') that allow access to low deck height spaces found in Ro-Ro vessels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (h) is analogous to OSHA's current weight requirement for intermodal containers. It would require
that cargo to be handled via the ship's ramp be either marked with its weight or have such weight clearly marked in a written
record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a practical matter, vessel stow plans most always contain such data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (i) requires tractors to have sufficient power and braking capacity to safely operate on Ro-Ro
vessels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously noted, this is especially important in negotiating tight spaces and steep grades on Ro-Ro vessels.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (k) would require that internal combustion engine vehicles only be operated when adequate ventilation
exists or is provided. It also provides guidance in determining acceptable levels of air contaminants generated
by the internal combustion process, by referring the reader to the appropriate section of this part and part 1910,
subpart Z (which is referenced in subpart A of this proposal. In most situations, the vessels themselves are fitted
out with ventilation systems at all decks. It has been the Agency's observation that a number of purpose built Ro-Ro
vessels possess ventilation systems that function remarkably well (Ex. 1&hyph;72), monitoring ambient air for
various air contaminants as well as explosive properties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (l) would require that cargo be secured to prevent sliding loads. This addresses the specific
hazard of cargo falling off trailers while in transit on Ro-Ro vessels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (m) would require that authorized persons, equipped with high visibility vests (or equivalent
protection), be the only employees permitted on any deck where Ro-Ro operations are being conducted. Requiring only
high visibility vests (or equivalent protection) and eliminating the allowance of using decals or reflectors is
a departure from what has been allowed in the Marine Terminal standard. As is noted in Section VI of this preamble, OSHA
proposes to eliminate the allowance of decals or reflectors in 1917.71(e) because of problems experienced with the
use of decals, reflectors, and similar items. The reflective area of a decal on a hard hat is obviously less than that
of a vest. Also, the reflective value is lost during daylight hours or whenever the wearer takes off the hard hat. A number
of serious accidents (Exs. 1&hyph;78, 1&hyph;89) have occurred in the past due to the nature of the work involved in
such cargo operations. This paragraph, along with the signalling requirements in proposed paragraph (n) that follow,
are expected to enable employers to avoid vehicle-related accidents onboard ships. Paragraph (n) addresses signalling
requirements for maneuvering vehicles into stowage positions while other personnel are in the adjacent vicinity.
In proposed 1918.87, OSHA sets out requirements for the utilization of shipboard elevators (lifts). Elevators are
most common on a number of different Ro-Ro and Combination carrier vessel designs. The hazards addressed by this section
are cargo falling from an improperly loaded elevator; and from wheeled cargo or employees falling into open spaces
in the deck created by a moving elevator. In approaching the issue of elevator usage, the Agency remained mindful of
foreign vessel design prerogatives. Consequently, the four paragraphs proposed within this section, are protective
of U.S. longshore workers obliged to use such installations, but are not expected to have an impact on any other nation's
vessel designs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summarizing this section, OSHA would require that safe working loads of elevators be determined and adhered to.
As a ``lifting appliance,'' shipboard elevators are part of a complement of gear that comes under considerable discussion
in ILO Convention No. 152 (see discussion of Subpart B_Gear Certification). As such, shipboard installations of
elevators will require certification of safe working loads as well as the posting of elevator capacity. In practical
terms, the employer's responsibility with regard to this paragraph is relatively simple to discharge. The requirement
for evenly distributing the weight(s) to be lifted, particularly when considering the various drive mechanisms
providing power to the elevator platforms, is an important provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (c) also is an important requirement that, while allowing the driver of a vehicle to remain at the
vehicle's controls, prohibits other persons from riding the elevator to other decks. Of necessity, the sides of many
shipboard elevators are unguarded while in transit. Riders, therefore, would be exposed to falls from sometimes
significant heights. The ILO's Code of Practice for Dock Work (Ex. 1&hyph;107) addresses this issue in much the same
manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposed paragraph (d), OSHA addresses a problem that both this Agency and the earlier Labor Standards Bureau have
recognize as needing attention (Ex. 1&hyph;82). This provision would require that if fall hazards are created by
open decks during the operation of shipboard elevators, the decks shall be barricaded. OSHA believes that under current
international practice most installations will already be effectively guarded. In those situations, however,
where the installation falls short in providing this safeguard, the employer must take the initiative in acquiring
and effectively utilizing the required barrier protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.88, ``Log operations,'' as previously mentioned in the preamble discussion of proposed 1918.38 ``Log
rafts,'' is also an entirely new section addressing the hazards associated with loading logs from the water into a
vessel. This is a particularly hazardous operation both because of the location where it occurs (on the water) and
the nature of the cargo. Logs that are loaded from the water usually have been in the water for a long period of time, causing
them to absorb water. The extra water adds to their weight and also loosens the bark, making the log surface very unsure
and slippery. The proposed provisions of this section have been taken from both existing longshore regulations and
from the ILWU-PMA Pacific Coast Marine Safety Code (PCMSC) (Ex. 1&hyph;145). In addition, these new requirements
are supported by record evidence developed by OSHA personnel in Region 10 (Ex. 1&hyph;146).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a) is taken from PCMSC Rule 417 (Ex. 1&hyph;145) and addresses the hazards associated with unstable
logs that could be in the hold of a vessel creating a situation where employees could be injured or killed should the
logs shift. Employees must not be in spaces in the hold when and where logs being loaded could strike them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) addresses the hazard associated with the physical condition of the log surface, which may
be slippery if there is no bark, or otherwise hazardous if the bark is loose and slides off the log as the employee is stepping
on it. Employers must provide appropriate footwear to employees that have to climb on the log. Such footwear typically
are spiked, also known as ``caulked'' shoes, may be styled like a sandal that attaches to existing footwear, and specifically
designed for working logs (Ex. 1&hyph;146, pp.13&hyph;14).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (c), which is taken from the current longshore 1918.96(f), requires that lifelines be furnished
and hung over the side when working log booms or cribs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (d) is also taken from the current longshore regulation 1918.23(c), and requires that a Jacob's
ladder be provided for each gang when working a log boom. However, in accordance with the provision in proposed 1918.23(c),
no more than two Jacob's ladders are required for each log boom being worked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (e) has also been taken from the current longshore regulations, 1918.96(e), and requires that
a U.S. Coast Guard approved life ring with at least 90 feet (27.4 m) of line be in the vicinity of the work area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final paragraph, (f), requires that a rescue boat be available when employees are working on log rafts or booms.
This requirement is similar to that found in Rule 638 of the PCMSC (Ex. 1&hyph;145). This addresses the hazard of employees
falling into the water while loading logs and being carried away by the river current and possibly drowning. The requirement
of a rescue boat would allow an employee who falls into the water to be quickly rescued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Much of the proposed language in this section is based on rules found in the Pacific Coast Marine Safety Code (PCMSC)
(Ex. 1&hyph;145), which has been negotiated by the Pacific Maritime Association and the International Longshoremen's
and Warehousemen's Union. In addition, OSHA believes that the proposed requirements reflect the current safe industry
practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA requests comment from the public concerning the completeness of these proposed regulations pertaining to handling
logs from the water. Proposed 1918.89, addressing hazardous cargo, is carried over from the existing Longshore standard
(1918.86). The same language is found addressing this issue when at shoreside cargo handling operations (1917.22).
Proposed 1918.89 and the Hazard Communication rule that is referenced in the ``Scope and Applicability'' paragraph,
1918.1(b)(6), complement one another in covering employee notification and procedures for handling hazardous
cargo. OSHA requests comment from the public on whether 1918.89(a) and (c), and similar language in 1917.22(a) and
(c) is repetitious in light of the Hazard Communication rule, keeping in mind that HazCom is referenced in both Parts.
(In addition, the exposure of employees to toxic and hazardous substances is addressed in subpart B of part 1917, in
proposed subpart I of part 1918 and in subpart Z of part 1910.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1987, OSHA extended the coverage of the Hazard Communication standard (HazCom) (29 CFR 1910.1200) to all employers
with employees exposed to hazardous chemicals in their workplaces. As a result, subpart I of part 1918 was amended
to include the requirements of that standard as 1918.90. Basically the HazCom standard requires such employers to
provide information to their employees concerning hazardous chemicals by means of hazard communication programs.
These programs would include the use of labels, material safety data sheets (MSDS), training and access to written
records. In addition, distributors of hazardous chemicals are required to ensure that containers they distribute
are properly labeled, and that a material safety data sheet is provided to their customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 24, 1987, OSHA, in expanding the coverage of this rule, also made certain revisions that address the handling
of sealed containers of hazardous materials, such as is usually done in longshoring work. Specifically, OSHA stated
at 52 FR 31861:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
There are a number of work situations where employees only handle sealed containers of chemicals, and under normal
conditions of use would not open the containers and would not expect to experience any measurable exposure to the chemicals.
Such work operations include, for example, warehousing, retail sales, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
marine cargo handling,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and trucking terminals. (Emphasis added.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA recognized, nonetheless, that even under these circumstances, the potential for a hazardous exposure could
occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is reasonable to assume, however, that all such containers are subject to leakage and breakage, and these employees
are in fact potentially exposed by virtue of the presence of these hazardous chemicals in their workplaces. Because
of this potential exposure, they need information to protect themselves form the hazards of these chemicals in the
event such an emergency situation occurs. (Id.)

Proposed 1918.90 consists solely of a cross-reference to the Scope and Applicability section of the proposal, specifically
1918.1(b)(6), which references the Hazardous Communication standard, 1910.1200. OSHA has decided to reference
the Hazard Communication standard in the scope section of this proposal as one of the part 1910 provisions applicable
to longshoring. This would have no effect on either the enforceability or the applicability of HazCom to longshoring.
OSHA proposes to do the same in the Marine Terminals standard (part 1917).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary HazCom obligations that apply to longshoring are found in 1910.1200(b)(4). This paragraph sets out the
basic duties of employers: (1) not to remove or deface labels affixed to containers of hazardous chemicals; (2) to
maintain and provide access to any MSDS's that are received for hazardous chemicals while the chemicals are in the
workplace; and (3) to obtain an MSDS when one is not received but an employee requests one. In addition, the employer
must train employees in accordance with the provisions of the rule to ensure they are protected in the event of a spill
or leak. The Agency seeks comment on this different approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.91 addresses housekeeping. In assessing the types of accidents that most occur in shipboard cargo
handling, one fact has remained constant: many involve slips, trips, and falls (Exs. 1&hyph;14, 1&hyph;73). Housekeeping
factors cause a substantial number of such accidents. Staying with the principle of providing a uniform regulatory
approach to shipboard and shoreside occupational safety and health, OSHA proposes, in this section, to bring into
part 1918 those applicable provisions of part 1917 that cover the same hazards on shore. Those remaining provisions,
which are vessel-specific, would be retained from the current part 1918. In addition, OSHA considers lashing gear
that is used with containers, roll-on, roll-off cargo, and, in particular, automobiles, to be ``equipment,'' as
referred to in paragraph (a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.92 provides illumination requirements for cargo handling work aboard vessels. Here again, OSHA remains
consistent with its shoreside rules in requiring 5 footcandles (average) (54 lux) of illumination at cargo operations.
In proposing this standard, OSHA believes that it will not only remain uniform with its shoreside rule (1917.123),
but also remain consistent with good illumination safety principles. (Ex. 1&hyph;152)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In crossing from one location to another, in this case shore to ship, it is a well-recognized safety practice to provide
uniform lighting. On this topic, the American National Standard practice for Industrial Illumination (ANSI/IES
RP&hyph;7&hyph;1991) (Ex. 1&hyph;152) states the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternate areas of extreme luminance differences are undesirable because it tires the eyes to adjust to them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
.... uniformity permits flexibility of functions and equipment and assures more uniform luminances. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (c) would require that lighting provided aboard ship does not shine into the eyes of personnel
in key positions of cargo control, such as crane and winch operators. Certainly it is extremely important to allow
a clear and unencumbered view to those that are in control of the cargo transit. With the same principle in mind, it would
also be required that stationary lights (those not mounted on vehicles) on Ro-Ro vessels not shine into the eyes of
drivers. In addition, the proposed requirements for portable lights and entry into dark areas closely parallel the
provisions in the existing standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.93, Hazardous atmospheres and substances, is designed to provide protection from atmospheric hazards
which are not specifically addressed in other proposed sections. In as much as these hazards are virtually identical
to those found in marine terminals, the language of this section largely tracks the requirements found in 1917.23.
Since the promulgation of the Marine Terminal standard, OSHA has promulgated a Permit-Required Confined Spaces
standard for General Industry (58 FR 4462, Jan. 14, 1993). Since both the Marine Terminal and Longshoring standards
currently addressed hazards associated with confined spaces, OSHA did not intend the General Industry standard
to apply to these workplaces. However, OSHA also had planned, in its ongoing development of this longshore proposal,
to conform the relevant longshore requirements to the more explicit and protective marine terminal requirements.
Furthermore, this approach is consistent with the vertical nature of these maritime standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the phrase ``the employer is aware'' that a hazardous condition exists means that the employer is or should
be aware of the hazardous condition. This section establishes requirements for the determination of the hazard,
the testing during ventilation, and the procedures for entry into hazardous atmospheres. In addition, the hazards
associated with emergency entry, inadvertent entry and asbestos spills are also addressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.94 provides requirements for ventilation and atmospheric workplace conditions. Proposed paragraph
(a) specifically addresses the hazards associated with carbon monoxide (CO) aboard ship. Longshoring work frequently
involves the use of internal combustion-powered equipment to facilitate the stowage and removal of cargo. This equipment
would include fork lift trucks, bulk cargo movers and the cargo itself (vehicles on Ro-Ro ships). Occupational fatalities
and disabling illnesses still appear on the waterfront (Exs. 1&hyph;76, 1&hyph;77, and 1&hyph;81) due to high levels
of (CO) accumulating from these sources in cargo spaces.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently OSHA's limit for (CO) in General Industry, Construction, and Shipyards is 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. The limits
in Marine Terminals and Longshoring are a 50 ppm and, in confined spaces, a 100 ppm ceiling. The ACGIH&hyph;1986 has
a TLV
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-TWA of 50 ppm and a TLV
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-STEL of 400 ppm for (CO) (Ex. 3&hyph;8). NIOSH (Ex. 3&hyph;1) recommends an 8-hour TWA limit of 35 ppm and a 200 ppm ceiling.
For both Longshoring and Marine Terminals, OSHA is proposing to lower the PELs for CO to 35 ppm (8-hour TWA) and is proposing
a 200 ppm (ceiling, measured over 5 minutes) in outdoor, non-enclosed spaces. OSHA is proposing to retain the 100 ppm
ceiling for CO in enclosed spaces in Marine Terminals and Longshoring. NIOSH concurs (Ex. 3&hyph;2) that the proposed
limits are appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carbon monoxide is a flammable, colorless, practically odorless gas. It is used as a reducing agent in metallurgical
operations, in the manufacture of metal carbonyls and zinc-based white pigments, and as a chemical intermediate.
Most occupational exposures to this ubiquitous substance are the result of the incomplete combustion of organic
material (HSDB 1990; Ex. 3&hyph;18).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carbon monoxide has caused a large number of industrial fatalities as a result of its tendency to combine readily with
hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). The Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) level for carbon
monoxide is 1500 ppm (Ex. 3&hyph;3). At levels above this, workers quickly lose consciousness; if exposure is not
terminated immediately, death by asphyxiation follows quickly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In experimental animals, asphyxiation occurs when the air-borne concentration of CO exceeds 3 percent (30,000 ppm)
(HSDB 1990). CO also causes reproductive and developmental effects in animals. The LD

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0027 unknown -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in rats is 1807 ppm for 4 hours (Ex. 3&hyph;4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Excessive accumulations of COHb cause hypoxic stress in healthy individuals as a result of the reduced oxygen carrying
capacity of the blood. In patients with cardiovascular disease, such stress can further impair cardiovascular function.
A number of studies show that 8-hour TWA exposures to 50 ppm carbon monoxide generally results in COHb levels of 8 to
10 percent. Such levels are not generally associated with overt signs or symptoms of health impairment in healthy
individuals with strong cardiovascular systems who are working under nonstressful conditions. However, the ACGIH
believes that a TLV
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-TWA of 25 ppm, which results in COHb levels of 4 percent or less, may be necessary to protect workers with cardiovascular
disease, because this condition places workers at higher risk of serious cardiovascular injury (Ex. 3&hyph;8, p.
1106). The NIOSH REL of 35 ppm TWA is also aimed at protecting workers with chronic heart disease (CHD); NIOSH believes
that such workers should not be allowed to have carboxyhemoglobin levels that approach 5 percent. In the part 1910
air contaminants rulemaking, several commenters questioned the need to lower the 8-hour TWA and to add a STEL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these commenters, OSHA quoted the ACGIH (Id.):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Each molecule of CO combining with hemoglobin reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and exerts a finite
stress on man. Thus, it may be reasoned that there is no dose of CO that is not without an effect on the body. Whether that
effect is physiologic or harmful 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
depends upon the dose of CO and the state of health of the exposed individual
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The body compensates for this hypoxic stress by increasing cardiac output and blood flow to specific organs, such
as the brain or the heart. When this ability to compensate is overpowered or is limited by disease, tissue injury results
[emphasis added].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exposure to CO sufficient to produce COHb saturations in the 3-5% range impairs cardiovascular function in patients
with cardiovascular disease and in normal subjects. *&blank;*&blank;* The primary effect of exposure to low concentrations
of CO on workmen results from the hypoxic stress secondary to the reduction in the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.
*&blank;*&blank;* Workmen with significant disease, both detected and undetected, may not be able to compensate
adequately and are at risk of serious injury. For such workers, a TLV of 25 ppm *&blank;*&blank;* might be necessary.
Even such a concentration might be detrimental to the health of some workers who might have far advanced cardiovascular
disease. *&blank;*&blank;* It would appear to the Committee that the time-weighted TLV of 50 ppm for carbon monoxide
might also be too high under conditions of heavy labor, high temperatures, or at high elevations (Ex. 3&hyph;8).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, the ACGIH also regards a lower limit for CO as necessary to protect workers with cardiovascular or pulmonary
disease or those working under stressful conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that it is clearly necessary to set a CO level that protects workers who have CHD because (1) a large percentage
of employees have it, (2) it is often not diagnosed or diagnosable, and (3) it is frequently fatal. The 35 ppm 8-hour
TWA is designed to protect employees with asymptomatic CHD. The term CHD is generally used to refer to the process of
atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, which leads to disturbances in the myocardial blood supply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general worker population in the United States is composed of a very significant number of persons with CHD. Since
the identification of such persons in the absence of overt clinical symptoms is virtually impossible, it is necessary
to assume that the average worker has asymptomatic CHD, especially when his/her first clinical symptom may be sudden
death (Ex. 3&hyph;1). Several studies demonstrate the significant risk associated with CO exposure, particularly
with respect to coronary heart disease. A study of firefighters in Los Angeles (Ex. 3&hyph;10) suggests that CO exposure
during firefighting may be responsible for the high incidence of heart disease in firefighters. In some fires, peak
exposures were occasionally as high as 3000 ppm CO, with 40 percent of peak values in the 100-to 500-ppm CO range. However,
in some fires, the peak CO exposure was below 100 ppm. Although these peak exposures in firefighters were high, firefighters
are likely to be exposed overall for fewer hours than the workers of concern in this rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A prevalence study was recently performed on angina pectoris, ECG changes, and blood pressure that involved 1,000
workers from 20 foundries (Ex. 3&hyph;11). A clear dose-response was found with regard to the prevalence of angina
(as obtained by history on a World Health Organization-recommended questionnaire) and CO exposure in workers (both
smokers and nonsmokers).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIOSH conducted a prospective cohort mortality study among 1,558 white male motor vehicle examiners who were employed
in New Jersey for a minimum of 6 months between 1944 and 1973 (Ex. 3&hyph;12). Industrial hygiene surveys indicated
that the examiners were exposed to carbon monoxide at a time-weighted-average (TWA) of 10 to 24 ppm. Using a modified
life table technique, the expected deaths were compared to the expected deaths through August 1973. The overall deficit
of mortality observed (SMR180) in this occupational cohort during the first 10-year period was to be expected as a
result of the widely accepted ``healthy worker effect.'' However, the component SMR for cardiovascular disease
deaths (134) was unexpected, since the ``healthy worker effect'' had been most significantly associated with decreased
cardiovascular disease mortality (Ex. 3&hyph;13). This evidence suggests that slightly elevated COHb may contribute
to excess cardiovascular disease rates in a healthy population that is of average fitness (since the work is not physically
hard).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A recent study (Ex. 3&hyph;14) reviewed the epidemiological evidence for an association between carbon monoxide
and heart disease and concluded that carbon monoxide exerts acute and possibly reversible short-term effects that
can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In another recent study, male volunteers aged 35 to 75 with stable exertional angina pectoris and positive exercise
treadmill tests were exposed to CO concentrations designed to cause 2.2 to 4.4 percent COHb levels after exercise.
The subjects performed a symptom-limited exercise test on a treadmill, followed by exposure for 1 hour to CO, and then
performed a second treadmill test. All subjects who completed the study (N=63) showed significant decreases in time
to onset of ischemic ST-segment changes; in the 2 percent COHb group, this change equalled 5.1 percent, and in the 4
percent COHb group it averaged a 12.1 percent decrease (Allred, Bleecher, Chaitman, Dahms, Gottlieb, Hackney et
al. 1989, in Res. Rep. Hlth. Effect. Inst. 25:79).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As pointed out above, cardiovascular disease (detected or undetected) and pulmonary impairment are widespread
in the general population in this country, in workers as well as other sub-populations. In addition, OSHA is particularly
concerned about the adverse effects of CO because workers regularly encounter complex and stressful situations
at work, including heat stress, jobs demanding heavy exertion, and tasks requiring both judgment and motor coordination.
OSHA standards are intended to protect workers of average and below-average fitness and those who engage only intermittently
in heavy physical labor and who do not therefore receive the benefit of physical conditioning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA thus has determined that, in Longshoring and Marine Terminals, the proposed 8-hour TWA of 35 ppm for carbon monoxide
is needed to reduce the significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease that is associated with overexposure
to CO. The Agency also believes that a ceiling of 200 ppm in outdoors, non-enclosed spaces is necessary to ensure that
peak CO exposures are kept below the 1500 ppm IDLH level by a reasonable safety factor. The ceiling limit will also assist
in keeping COHb levels below 5 percent; the ceiling will be measured over 5 minutes to permit the use of simpler monitoring
techniques.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this evidence, OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 35 ppm and a ceiling of 200 ppm in outdoor, non-enclosed spaces
as the PELs for carbon monoxide in the longshoring and marine terminal industries. In these industries, however,
most employees regularly enter and work in a compartment, hold, or other enclosed space, in which CO levels can increase
rapidly if uncontrolled. CO, therefore, presents an especially great danger of death from IDLH levels of CO. Consequently,
OSHA is retaining the 100 ppm ceiling for CO in such spaces, as well as the provision requiring monitoring of these spaces.
The Agency would continue to require that the employer monitor the ambient air within any cargo space where internal
combustion engines discharge their exhaust. Therefore, when concentrations of CO in these enclosed spaces reach
100 ppm, work shall be suspended and the workers removed from the spaces. Work shall not resume until concentrations
of CO, as determined by actual monitoring, have been reduced to within the allowable limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that these limits will ensure that the COHb levels of exposed workers (especially of non-smokers)
in these sectors are maintained at or below 5 percent, which will protect those workers at greater risk because of cardiovascular
or pulmonary impairment. In addition, these revised limits will protect healthy workers in the affected sectors
who must work in environments involving intermittent exertion, heat stress, or other strenuous conditions. OSHA
believes that these limits are necessary to substantially reduce the significant occupational risk associated
with both chronic and peak exposures to carbon monoxide in the workplace. The hypoxic stress associated with exposure
to carbon monoxide clearly constitutes a material impairment of health and functional capacity. For a more complete
discussion of these health effects see 57 FR 26371.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If natural or vessel supplied ventilation is not sufficient to maintain levels within the allowable limits, the employer
must utilize supplemental methods until such levels are reached (generally accomplished with portable blowers).
It should be noted that the proposed requirement deletes the language ``before work is resumed.'' This is to make the
requirement reflect more clearly the actual industry practices being employed to control exposure to CO through
the use of engineering controls. The longshoring work itself generates CO through the use of the loading equipment.
In reality, then, it is not the circumstance that 100 ppm is routinely reached, the hold is cleared of workers, supplemental
blowers are used to clear the air and then the workers return to work. Rather, when a sustained build-up of CO is detected,
even at much lower levels, the supplemental blowers or other additional means are employed to maintain the exposures
to within the allowable limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Portable ventilating equipment must be guarded to prevent employee injury, and they must be effectively grounded
by a grounding conductor run with or enclosing the circuit conductors. In situations where portable ventilating
equipment is run by vessel supplied power, the grounding conductor must be bonded to the structure of the vessel. Given
the shipboard environment, careful attention must be paid to the electric cords of portable equipment, making certain
they are not worn or otherwise unserviceable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is proposing to retain the requirement for recording tests of the atmosphere. The stevedoring community is successfully
using such testing logs as a frame of reference in assessing atmospheric conditions from one point in time to the next.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposed paragraph (b), OSHA addresses the longshoring hazards associated with handling grain that has been treated
with fumigants. Grain is subject to infestation by insects and rodents during storage and shipping. Fumigants used
to control infestation can be liquid or solid compounds that release poisonous gases and can be applied in the form
of sprays, fogs or gases or by direct contact (Ex. 1&hyph;104).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* these gases are harmful, possibly fatal, to humans as long as they remain potent. Therefore, they
constitute a safety hazard from the time of application throughout the duration of their potency_which may last for
several days. (Id. p.36).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Here, OSHA would require that the employer determine whether or not grain to be loaded or discharged aboard a vessel
had been fumigated. Such a determination shall be based on direct communication with knowledgeable persons from
both the grain elevator and the vessel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a cargo has been fumigated, an employer shall designate a person (see 1918.2(c)), who is thoroughly familiar
with the characteristics of the fumigant being used and how to properly assess contaminant levels; fully aware of
the manufacturer of the fumigant's use recommendations and warnings; and knowledgeable about the proper personal
protective equipment which must be worn to safely guard against the possible effects of the fumigant. The designated
person must test the vessel's compartments after loading begins, but before longshore employees (generally trimmers)
enter. Subsequent tests must be made to ensure that fumigant concentrations to exposed personnel never attain levels
that are beyond the allowable limits. Records of those tests are retained by the employer for a period of 30 days. Whenever
the concentration in any compartment reaches the level specified as hazardous by the fumigant manufacturer or by
subpart Z of 29 CFR part 1910, whichever is lower, all employees shall be removed from such compartments and shall not
be permitted to re-enter until such time as tests demonstrate that the atmosphere is within allowable limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with 1917.25 of the Marine Terminal standard, during emergencies or while tests are being undertaken
in compartments that have hazardous or unknown concentrations of fumigant, the designated person entering the compartment
must be properly outfitted with personal protective equipment, (See criteria at proposed 1918.94(b)(3)(v)), and
must be observed while conducting such tests by two standby employees, who are themselves properly outfitted. The
personal protective equipment used by the designated person and the observers, will be required to be readily available
wherever fumigated grains are handled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In situations where it is necessary to carry out insecticide or pesticide treatment of a localized nature, such as
in rodent control, paragraph (b)(4) would require that employees conducting the treatment and those that may be exposed
to the chemical(s) applied, be equipped with personal protective equipment that meets the specifications set out
by the manufacturer of the chemical(s) being used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposing these rules covering fumigated grain cargoes, the Agency has relied upon the existing rule for longshore
employment (Ex. 1&hyph;39) but has also utilized the Agency's experience in promulgating the general industry Permit-required
Confined Space standard (29 CFR 1910.146, 58 FR 4549), together with accident data (Ex. 1&hyph;104) relating to fumigated
grain cargoes aboard ship. Finally, these rules are further supported by similar provisions found in the Pacific
Coast Marine Safety Code (Ex. 1&hyph;145) and the U.S. Coast Guard's ``Interim Regulations for Shipboard Fumigation,''
46 CFR&hyph;147A (Ex. 1&hyph;105).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposed paragraph (c), the Agency proposes requirements for handling cargoes of fumigated tobacco. Tobacco
cargoes, both ported and exported, are shipped most typically in bales, in hogsheads, and in intermodal containers.
OSHA's proposed Longshoring requirements apply when cargoes are break-bulk, i.e., piece lots of bales or in hogsheads.
When such cargoes are containerized, OSHA addresses employee exposure in the Marine Terminal standard (29 CFR 1917.25(g)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of break-bulk fumigated tobacco cargoes, the employer would be required to determine (by written notification)
if the cargo has in fact been fumigated. If so, the employer would be further required to obtain a written warranty from
the fumigator(s) that the cargo has been sufficiently aerated (concentration of fumigant is within allowable limits.)
OSHA notes that this practice is currently in place at all longshore operations in the U.S. handling tobacco. In the
case of containerized shipments of fumigated tobacco, OSHA is proposing new language that can be found in the proposed
changes to the Marine Terminal regulations, 1917.25(g), which is part of this proposal and which is discussed in Section
VI of this rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraphs (d) and (e) remain virtually identical to the existing provisions. Paragraph (d) involves a
work practice to discover hazardous exposures to fumigants of any cargo other than grain and tobacco while paragraph
(e) involves the use of personal protective equipment to protect against heavy concentrations of dust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (f) addresses operations aboard vessels engaged in the menhaden trade. Menhaden is a term that
refers to several species of trash fish. Menhaden is used to produce, among other products, fertilizer, pet food and
fish oil. (See 46 FR 4213.) As cargo to specialized menhaden marine terminals, menhaden presents a health hazard to
longshore workers when it decomposes, generating hydrogen sulfide (H

S). As recently as 1987, a hydrogen sulfide incident aboard a menhaden vessel led to serious injury and a fatality (Ex.
1&hyph;80). OSHA's current limit for hydrogen sulfide in Marine Terminals is 20 ppm as an 8-hour TWA; the current Longshore

REL for this substance (Ex. 3&hyph;3). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 10 ppm in Longshoring and Marine Terminals
with a STEL of 15 ppm. Promulgation of these PELs will make OSHA's limits for hydrogen sulfide consistent with the best
available evidence on the hazards of H

) in the utilities sector. In agriculture, it is used as a disinfectant (HSDB 1985). It is also generated by the fermentation
of animal manure. Many farm workers have been exposed to this substance while working in the vicinity of liquid manure
storage pits and have been asphyxiated as a consequence (Ex. 4&hyph;1). Hydrogen sulfide also is encountered in natural
oil and gas deposits and in sewers, caissons, tunnels, and other construction sites (Grant 1986, p. 495). When used
in pesticidal applications and as directed on the label, this substance is regulated by the EPA under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). In longshoring, the hazard is brought about by the generation of hydrogen
sulfide gas, caused by the decomposition of the menhaden (and similar species) catch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hydrogen sulfide's effects on experimental animals are similar to those seen in exposed workers: conjunctivitis,
pulmonary irritation, acute poisoning, and death by chemical asphyxiation (Ex. 4&hyph;2). The LD

 in mice is 673 ppm for 1 hour (Ex. 4&hyph;3). A number of experiments have demonstrated that exposure to hydrogen sulfide
concentrations of 50 to 100 ppm for several hours (or sometimes longer) causes damage to the corneal epithelium of
dogs, cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs; animals are believed to be somewhat less sensitive than humans to hydrogen sulfide's
ocular effects but may be more sensitive to its pulmonary effects (Grant 1986, p. 1496).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When inhaled at concentrations exceeding 500 ppm, exposure to hydrogen sulfide has caused respiratory paralysis
and death. Acutely poisoned individuals who recover may experience headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and nystagmus;
eventually, however, recovery is usually complete (Ex. 4&hyph;4). The 1986 ACGIH 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ex. 1-3, p. 1318) cites several reports (Ex. 4&hyph;6) of the occurrence of adverse ocular effects, including conjunctivitis,
caused by exposure to 20 ppm or less of hydrogen sulfide. A study by Poda and Aiken (Ex. 4&hyph;7) reports that the adoption
of a voluntary limit of 10 ppm in two heavy-water plants eliminated exposure problems at those facilities. An early
study by Flury and Zernik (1931f) reports that the conjunctivitis caused by the exposure of volunteers to 10 to 15 ppm
of hydrogen sulfide for six hours endured for several days; however, this substance is not known to have caused irreversible
eye damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The author of the best-known general source on the toxicology of the eye (Grant 1986) states that ``where the concentration
[of hydrogen sulfide] is regularly kept below 10 ppm in air, it is rare to have any irritation of the eyes'' (p. 1496).
OSHA believes that the proposed STEL will ensure that concentrations are maintained close to the 8-hour TWA and that
excursions above irritant levels are thus minimized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this evidence, OSHA believes that the current 10-ppm 8-hour TWA limit alone does not adequately protect workers
in Longshoring and Marine Terminals against the adverse ocular effects associated with exposure to concentrations
of hydrogen sulfide above 10 ppm. OSHA believes that the eye irritation and conjunctivitis associated with such exposures
represent a significant risk of material health impairment to these workers because they may experience pain and
other ocular effects and be forced to seek medical treatment after such exposures. OSHA is accordingly proposing
an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 ppm for hydrogen sulfide with a short-term limit of 15 ppm in these parts 1917 and 1918. Based
on available information, the Agency has determined that these limits are necessary to provide protection from the
significant risk of exposure-related ocular effects, including conjunctivitis, corneal edema, and distortion
of vision, associated with occupational exposure to hydrogen sulfide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the hazard this paragraph seeks to avoid is brought about by the generation of hydrogen sulfide gas, caused by
the decomposition of the menhaden (and similar species) catch, the requirements are not applicable to operations
aboard vessels with operable refrigerated compartments used to hold the catch. Paragraph (f) requires that tests
be performed before and during discharge, by designated personnel who are trained and competent in their understanding
of the potential hazards involved within the catch hold(s). The test would include assessments of hydrogen sulfide
and oxygen content of the atmosphere(s) within the hold(s). Employers would be prohibited from sending employees
into the hold(s) unless the hydrogen sulfide level was kept below 10 parts per million on a time weighted average with
a short term exposure limit of 15 ppm measured over a 15 minute sampling period. Oxygen levels must be maintained to
at least 19.5 percent. In arriving at these proposed requirements, OSHA utilizes information that supported similar
requirements for the shoreside aspect of menhaden operations in the Agency's rules for Marine Terminals (1917.73;
See discussion at 46 FR 4213). Also, in the development of the proposed requirements, the National Fish Meal &amp;
Oil Association was clearly supportive of the proposed regulatory posture. In communications between that group
and the Department of Labor, and in memoranda to the association's membership (Ex. 1&hyph;56), it is clear that industry
practice is quite consistent with OSHA's proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.95 contains requirements for sanitary considerations at all longshoring operations. OSHA believes
that the hazards associated with poor sanitation and sanitary practices are well established and need not be elaborated
here. The proposed provisions are fully consistent with the current regulations for shoreside cargo handling (1917.127),
providing the uniformity that is necessary between the two segments of marine cargo handling. OSHA is proposing in
both 1917.127 and 1918.95 to include tables which specify the number of toilet facilities according to the number
of employees at the worksite. This table has been taken from the sanitation section in OSHA's Construction Safety
Regulations, 29 CFR 1926.51(c). OSHA requests the public to comment on the inclusion of this table in this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summarizing the section, OSHA would require that employers provide their workers with washing and toilet facilities
that are equipped with hot and cold (or tepid) running water; soap; clean hand towels (or warm air blowers); clean and
functional toilets (that offer separate compartments with a latched door), and clean drinking water (with no common
cups). The consumption of food or drink would continue to be prohibited wherever hazardous materials are stowed or
being handled (see definition at 1918.2(g)). Additionally, cargo handling operations are to be separated (by barriers)
from the vessel's uncovered refuse and, in the unlikely event of a sanitary line overboard discharge, from it as well.
Since longshoring work is performed adjacent to a marine terminal, if the marine terminal's sanitation facilities
are available for longshore employees' use, this would constitute compliance with 1918.95. (Section 1917.127,
which covers sanitation at marine terminals, is virtually identical to proposed 1918.95.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because longshoring operations generally take place in a location with restricted space, i.e., aboard a ship, other
non-associated but often necessary work (such as ship's maintenance and repair) must be conducted carefully, with
due deference to the cargo handling being performed. In such circumstances, employees may be exposed to hazards associated
with excessive noise leading to impaired communications, excessive light or heat from hot work, overspray from abrasive
blasting or spray painting, or non-ionizing radiation. In OSHA's current rules for Longshoring (1918.95), the Agency
has prescribed requirements to account for the hazards that can be anticipated when maintenance and repair work are
concurrently undertaken with cargo handling. Those same rules are proposed in 1918.95 (with very minor change) to
be included in the revision of this part. Summarizing them, longshoring operations would be prohibited when noise
produced by such concurrent work interferes with the communication of warnings or instructions; when falling objects
could fall on cargo handlers from such work being conducted overhead; when welding slag, burning sparks or welding
rod flash could injure cargo handlers; and when abrasive blasting or spray painting is being performed in the vicinity
of cargo operations. Additionally, OSHA is proposing to prohibit cargo handling operations where the employees
are exposed to electromagnetic (non-ionizing) radiation that is emitted from the radio and radar equipment on the
vessel. This could be especially dangerous when employees are working on the tops of containers while work is being
done to the radar or radio equipment. OSHA is also aware of the dangers associated with non-ionizing radiation emitted
from radio and television towers that are close to marine cargo handling facilities and has included the words ``or
from radio or television transmitting towers ashore'' in this paragraph. OSHA issued a Hazard Information Bulletin
on September 5, 1990, concerning a non-ionizing radiation incident caused by radio transmitting towers that were
near a cargo handling facility. The radio frequency emissions were aimed in the direction of the cargo handling operation
and the radiation caused longshore workers touching the crane wires and hooks to be burned. This situation was corrected
by having the transmissions directed away from the cargo handling area, however other options were available such
as, insulating the cargo hook, or providing proper personal protective equipment (Ex. 1&hyph;137).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.97 sets out requirements for first aid and lifesaving, and parallels closely the same considerations
set out by OSHA in its rules for the shoreside aspect of marine cargo handling (1917.26). The hazards that this section
is meant to address are those that would occur in the absence of first aid or rescue; that is, following an accident,
this section is intended to mitigate the extent of injury to the employee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summarizing this proposed section, the employer would be required to direct all employees to report all injuries.
A first aid kit would be required to be available at each vessel being worked, with at least one person holding a valid
first aid certificate also available to administer first aid. OSHA does not stipulate who the certificate's issuing
organization must be, but remains consistent with its position taken while developing the Marine Terminals rule,
wherein the agency stated at 46 FR 4193:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
No particular first aid course or approving agency is designated, so long as the certificate is issued by a responsible
organization which requires successful completion of a course as evidence of qualification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA sets out no specific criteria for the contents of the required first aid kit(s). The Agency does, however, propose
to have those needs individualized by a physician who, in consultation with the employer, can customize first aid
kit contents to the hazards to be encountered. This is consistent with the approach taken by OSHA in its General Industry
(1910.151(b)) and its Construction standards (1926.50(d)(1)). OSHA believes this approach to be not only more flexible,
but more protective as well. It should be noted that OSHA is proposing to amend the Marine Terminal regulations to read
the same as what is being proposed in this draft in regards to first aid kits and emergency stretchers. Requiring weekly
checks of the contents of first aid kits is again consistent with OSHA's Safety and Health Regulations for Construction,
1926.50(d)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, OSHA proposes to include more specific requirements addressing strength and design characteristics
of emergency stretchers (Stokes baskets). These requirements reflect the terms of an agreement between the West
Gulf Maritime Association and individual locals of the I.L.A. operating on the Gulf of Mexico, which OSHA considers
to be appropriate for inclusion in the proposal. The requirement that the stretcher have at least four sets of ``effective''
patient restraints means that the restraints must be able to secure the patient to the stretcher even if the stretcher
and patient is being lifted vertically. In an accident cited earlier in the preamble, (Ex. 1&hyph;90), where the employee
was being carried vertically in the stretcher, the restraints were not effective and the patient fell off.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposed 1918.98, OSHA sets out requirements for the qualifications of machinery operators, i.e., crane or winch
operators, industrial truck drivers, conveyor operators, etc., and provides proposed language to require the training
of supervisory personnel, i.e., gang foremen, stevedore superintendents, etc., in accident prevention. The hazards
addressed by this section arise from inexperienced, untrained or inappropriate operators of cargo handling machinery;
and hazards created by improperly trained supervisory personnel. These hazards can readily lead to accidental injury
or death.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both topics originate in the shoreside rules (1917.27), and focus on very important aspects indisputably tied to
safe cargo operations. The proposed provisions would require that all employees (except supervised trainees) be
familiar with signs, signals and operating instructions before operating cargo handling machinery or before giving
signals to operators. OSHA would require that employee competency to perform such work be determined by the employer,
using training and experience as criteria in making such a determination. The employer would be prohibited from allowing
employees with a known incapacitating ailment, such as heart disease or epilepsy, or employees with defective uncorrected
hearing or eyesight, from operating that equipment. Because supervisory training is considered to be essential
to reducing the amount of accidents in any industrial setting, the Agency proposes to set requirements for the shipboard
cargo handling workplace that will complement such requirements already in place for shoreside work. OSHA asks the
public to comment on the effectiveness of the shoreside supervisory programs and benefits that have been derived.
In proposing this requirement, the Agency notes that the great majority of supervisory persons already trained in
accident prevention under the part 1917 rules, are those same individuals who would be covered by the training requirement
under this proposal. The Agency requests interested persons to submit comment on the proportion of supervisory employees
for whom such training would actually be required. The same built-in transition periods established for training
within the Marine Terminals rule (two years after the promulgation of the final rule and after that date 90 days after
supervisory assignment), are proposed also for shipboard application. The criteria for course content is performance-based,
allowing for instruction to be tailored to the particular operation(s). The recommended topics included as a footnote
are considered to be rudimentary to most shipboard cargo handling operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that current 1918.98 entitled ``Grain fitting'' is being deleted by this proposal. OSHA believes
that this type of longshoring operation is obsolete and no longer exists. OSHA, however, recognizes that interested
parties may have differing views regarding this deletion and invite comment on this point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart J_Personal Protective Equipment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All proposed sections of this subpart are based in the requirements for personal protective equipment found in the
shoreside requirements for marine cargo handling (1917.91, 1917.92, 1917.92, 1917.93, 1917.94, and 1917.95).
The hazards addressed by this section are those that personal protective equipment can eliminate or ameliorate by
its proper use. For example, eye protection can prevent the loss of an eye; foot protection can prevent a broken foot;
respirators can prevent toxic poisoning; and so on. As was the case in that rulemaking, (48 FR 30903), OSHA again sets
out the principle that whether the PPE costs must be borne by employers depends largely on whether the employee has
possession, responsibility and control over the specific piece of equipment. As an example, items such as protective
gloves and foot wear are among pieces of gear that employees may bring home for personal use between work shifts, but
the employees would be protected by the gear while at work. As such, the employer has to make available and assure that
employees wear such equipment, but the standard does not require the employer to furnish it free of cost. Other items
however, such as respirators, fall protection systems and special protective clothing, are pieces of gear that the
employer is required to furnish and maintain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These are items that do not leave the workplace and are always under the control of the employer. Such items are those
for which the employee is not obligated to bear any cost under the standards. OSHA understands that various arrangements
exist for shared cost responsibilities and sole cost responsibilities at different parts of the Nation's waterfront,
and leaves to the employers and employees the right to resolve such issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.101, would require employees performing work which is hazardous to the eyes be provided with protection
that meets the requirements (evidenced by marking or labeling) of the American National Standard for Occupational
and Educational Eye and Face Protection (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989). Such eye protection would be required to be maintained
in good condition, with cleaning and disinfection performed prior to issuance to another worker.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.102 refers to 1918.1(b)(12), which adopts by reference OSHA's General Industry standard for respiratory
protection (1910.134). The shipboard cargo handling environment is not unique in the selection or use of respiratory
protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposed 1918.103, the Agency requires that employees whose heads are exposed to hazards associated with impact
or electric shocks or burns be equipped with and be required to wear protective hats that meet the design requirements
(evidenced by marking or labeling) of American National Standard Requirements for Protective Head Wear for Industrial
Workers (ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986). It also requires that cleaning and disinfection be performed when reissued to another
worker.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1918.104 addresses foot protection, requiring that employees exposed to impact or puncture hazards wear
safety footwear meeting the design requirements of the American National Standard for Personal Protection_Protective
Footwear. ANSI Z41&hyph;1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this rulemaking, OSHA also proposes to update the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) references that
are in the Marine Terminal standard so that they are the same as in the proposed Longshoring standard; 1917.91 (Eye
protection); 1917.93 (Head protection); and 1917.94 (Foot protection).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposed 1918.105, other forms of protective measures for personnel are addressed. In summary, OSHA adopts a general
approach to all additional protective clothing which requires that the employer provide and see to the proper use
of all such measures. The Agency would require that all additional protective clothing be cleaned and disinfected
before reissuance. It notes, however, that some types of equipment, such as disposable coveralls, require no cleaning
or disinfection since they are single use items and discarded once used. Also, in some instances protective clothing
may be issued, but because never worn or soiled, necessitates no further sanitary measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Personal flotation devices would be provided by the employer and required for all employees whose work exposes them
to falls into the water in any of the following circumstances: when they are working in isolation (such as when adjusting
by oneself mooring lines of a small craft abreast of a larger vessel); where physical constraints posed by limited
working or walking area creates a fall hazard (such as when securing lines at the outboard edge of a barge having a narrow
fore and aft walkway, or where the work area is obstructed by cargo or other obstacles in a manner that does not allow
employees safe footing (such as when securing boom tie-downs at the outboard edge of a floating crane whose deck is
congested with auxiliary hoisting equipment). OSHA is also proposing to add that personal flotation devices be worn
by employees that are doing any work on the deck of a barge. There are numerous incidents of drowning which have occurred
when employees have fallen overboard from a barge. Often these falls from a barge occur in the river system, where rapid
currents increase the danger of drowning (Exs. 1&hyph;103, Case Nos. 13, 17, 18, 72, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 101, 130,
136, 139, 143). OSHA feels that the danger of falling overboard while working on the deck of a barge (as opposed to working
on the deck of a ship where the edge of the deck generally is guarded by a bulwark and railing) is sufficiently great as
to add this proposed language. All personal flotation devices would be required to be a Coast Guard approved preserver
or vest, and would be expected to be maintained in a safe and serviceable condition (no rips, rot or punctures and all
closure devices in good order).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In all cases, it is clearly not enough just to have PPE available; the equipment needs to be used. The standard requires
the employer to enforce the wearing of each type PPE whenever it is needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendices I, II, and III
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix I is a non-mandatory appendix that sets out the format of vessel cargo gear registers and certificates, under
the terms of ILO Convention 152 (Ex. 1&hyph;33), discussed earlier in reference to 1918.11. Major changes from the
original ILO Convention 32 (Ex. 1&hyph;34), include a new Form (Form No. 2 (U) which is a certificate issued by a ``competent
person'' (most often a surveyor under the employ of a vessel classification society or inspection surety service)
that contains the results of testing and examination of derricks used in union purchase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of foreign flagged ship's gear with which U.S.longshore workers load or discharge cargo, OSHA acts in the
role of the ``competent authority'' in determining which ``competent person(s)''/``responsible person(s)''
are in fact qualified to witness tests/exams and execute certificates and registers. For this purpose, as a practical
matter, OSHA recognizes persons and organizations acceptable to the Nation under whose laws the particular vessel
is registered. In the event that a given flag has no laws that specifically apply (Ex. 1&hyph;91), OSHA would rely upon
the vessel having a register and certificates endorsed by an entity approved for that purpose by the Commandant of
the U.S. Coast Guard (see 46 CFR 91.37) or, alternately, an organization accredited by OSHA under part 1919 of this
chapter (see proposed 1918.11). Another significant change from the original Convention, is the interval between
tests of cargo handling gear. Such gear, under the terms of Convention 32, was required to be tested (for the assignment
of a safe working load) initially before being taken into use. Because OSHA's current rule adopts the testing and examination
requirements for vessel's cargo gear contained in Convention 32 (see 1918.12(a) of the current rules), the Agency
can presently require that such gear is initially tested but, absent special circumstances, the gear is not required
to be tested again. As a practical matter, most vessels (those operating under the rules of classification societies
and international inspection services) have been operating under a quadrennial test schedule. With the advent of
Convention 152, the international standard has shifted to ``at least once in every five years,'' giving latitude
to all organizations desiring to maintain the four year cycle. In proposing to stay in step with the international
standard, OSHA offers this Appendix to assist employers and employees in correctly ascertaining the form and content
of registers and certificates prescribed for in the newer Convention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix II, which is also non-mandatory, is offered as an aid to employers and employees in arriving at strength values
of various pieces of gear used aboard ship in longshoring operations. Although the primary source for information
on component gear strength is ``the manufacturer's recommendations'' or ``the manufacturer's recommended ratings,''
the Agency appreciates that instances will arise wherein such recommendations or ratings will not be available (such
as when some preslung cargoes are to be discharged from foreign ports). In such instances, proposed Appendix contains
tables which can be used to evaluate hoisting equipment. Many of the tables appearing in this Appendix are taken directly
from the latest American National Standard (ASME B30.9&hyph;1990 and addenda titled, Slings) (Ex. 1&hyph;148).
The balance of the tables (those for allowable chain wear; shackle safe working loads; and wire rope clips) are derived
from an amalgam of other OSHA rules for Longshoring, Construction (1926.251), and General Industry (1910.184).
These tables have been carefully assessed by OSHA as to their appropriateness for cargo handling applications, and
the Agency believes that they will serve as fully protective criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix III, which is also non-mandatory, recognizes that, in some very limited situations, the use of fall protection
may be infeasible. OSHA has listed two narrowly defined situations where it feels that fall protection may not be feasible.
OSHA solicits comment from the public regarding the appropriateness of these two examples and whether there are additional
examples of infeasibility. In addition, OSHA would consider this as an appropriate place to include any other advisory
information regarding container top safety and solicits comments accordingly.

VI. Proposed Amendments and Corrections To Marine Terminal Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several of the proposed amendments to the Longshoring standard (part 1918) address marine cargo handling hazards
that should be reflected by a corresponding provision in the Marine Terminal standard (part 1917). For example, both
parts currently do not explicitly prohibit employees from riding the hook or the load. By contrast, proposed 1918.81(l)
prohibits this practice as does proposed 1917.45(l). The basis for this prohibition is discussed above. For the purposes
of this discussion, when the basis for a proposed amendment is treated in the preamble above, it is not necessary to
repeat it here. OSHA is requesting comment from the public on proposed amendments to Marine Terminals (part 1917)
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new paragraph (d) has been added to 1917.11 that addresses the hazards associated with protruding nails that may
be left in materials, such as dunnage, that have ben removed from the vessels and placed ashore. This paragraph has
been taken from language that is in the current Longshoring regulations and is in the proposal at 1918.91(h)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently in both parts, the allowable exposure limits for carbon monoxide is 50 ppm over an 8-hour time weighted average
with a ceiling of 100 ppm. OSHA is proposing to change the 8-hour time weighted average to 35 ppm while leaving the ceiling
limit at 100 ppm. This change is reflected in both proposed parts in 1918.94 and 1917.24. (See above.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In another example, currently in both 1918.96 and 1917.26, the contents of a first-aid kit are specifically listed.
In proposed 1918.96, however, the contents of a first-aid kit are to be determined by a physician. OSHA feels that the
proposed part 1918 standard is more protective and proposes to amend 1917.26 to be consistent. OSHA would also incorporate
into part 1917 the more extensive provisions that are found in proposed 1918.96 pertaining to the requirements for
stokes basket stretchers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1917.45(j)(2), OSHA is proposing to require that all cranes used to hoist personnel be equipped with and operate
in the power up and power down mode and have the brake apply automatically when not hoisting or lowering. This is consistent
with proposed 1918.66(c)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is proposing a new requirement in 1917.50(i)(1), that prohibits exceeding the safe working load of cargo handing
gear which is similar to language found in proposed 1918.61(b)(1). OSHA is also proposing a new requirement in 1917.50(i)(2),
which requires the safe working load be marked on cargo handling gear with a safe working load greater than 5 short tons.
This proposal is similar to proposed 1918.61(b)(2). See the discussion on these proposed requirements in the preamble
for 1918.61.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1917.71(e), OSHA is proposing to allow only high-visibility vests (or equivalent protection) to be worn and remove
the words ``decals or reflectors.'' This would be in agreement with proposed 1918.86(n). As indicated above, the
reflective area of a decal on a hard hat is obviously less than that of a vest. Also, the reflective value is lost during
daylight hours or whenever the wearer takes off the hard hat. A number of serious accidents (Exs. 1&hyph;78, 1&hyph;89)
have occurred in the past due to the nature of the work involved in such cargo operations. Additionally, OSHA is proposing
to amend the language found in 1917.71(f)(5) to reflect the language found in proposed 1918.86(f), which requires
that all brake air-lines be connected when pulling trailers equipped with air brakes. OSHA is proposing to change
1917.73(a)(2) to read 10 ppm of hydrogen sulfide to agree with proposed 1918.94(f)(4). As recently as 1987, a hydrogen
sulfide incident aboard a menhaden vessel led to serious injury and a fatality (Ex. 1&hyph;80). (See discussion of
this for 1918.94(f) in Section V of this proposal).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA proposes to carry over to 1917.71 the provision found in proposed 1918.86(g) that requires that flat bed and low
boys trailers (mafi's) be marked with their cargo capacities and not be overloaded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also seeks public comment on two proposed rules to be included in the Marine Terminal standard that do not have
analogous rules in the proposed Longshoring standard. First, OSHA proposes to require that seat (lap) belt restraints
be installed in the crane operators seat in high-speed container gantry cranes. High speed container gantry cranes
are now capable of hoist speeds of 360 feet per minute (110 m/min) (without a load) and trolley speeds of 500 feet per
minute (152 m/min). OSHA is concerned that the operator may be exposed to potentially injurious effects of sudden
stops and starts (Ex. 1&hyph;133). OSHA believes that operator restraints will minimize the hazard and seeks comment
from the public on this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of shipments of tobacco that have been containerized and then fumigated, OSHA is proposing, in 1917.25(g),
that such containers be aerated (before being loaded on a ship) as follows: (1) If in unsealed bales or in hogsheads,
aerated (with doors open) for 48 hours after fumigation has been completed, and, (2) if contained in a plastic enclosure,
aerated (with doors open) for 72 hours. In proposing these requirements, OSHA relies on studies performed by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service (Ex. 1&hyph;70). These studies concluded that intermodal
containers so treated required 48 to 72 hours aeration to be free of hazardous fumigant levels. Past and recent communications
(Ex. 1&hyph;95) with the Tobacco Association of the United States, also show that organization in accord with the
72-hour aeration required for tobacco shipped in polyethylene or similarly lined boxes carried in intermodal containers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon the publication of the final Marine Terminal standard, several technical drafting amendments were treated
in the preamble that were not consistently picked up in the subsequent regulatory text. OSHA is now proposing that
these amendments be made. Several paragraphs have been corrected by removing the phrase, ``The employer shall ensure...'',
from the beginning of the paragraph. See the discussion for this in 48 FR 30888&hyph;30889. The paragraphs that have
been corrected in this manner are: 1917.18(a); 1917.43(e)(1)(i); 1917.44(o)(3)(ii); 1917.44(o)(4); 1917.126(b);
1917.152(f)(1); 1917.152(f)(2) and 1917.152(f)(3)(iv). In addition, several paragraphs are being proposed to
be revised by changing the phrase, ``shall be available at the terminal'' to the phrase, ``shall be made available
for inspection''. See the discussion for this in 48 FR 30889. The proposed paragraphs that reflect this change are:
1917.24(d), 1917.25.(c), 1917.42(b)(4), 1917.42(c)(1), 1917.42(d)(1), 1917.42(h)(4), and 1917.42(h)(5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is also aware of several typographical errors that are in the current 29 CFR part 1917 and intends to correct those
in this rulemaking. For example, one of these corrections is in 1917.42. A square root sign has been added to the formula
found in paragraph (d)(2), correcting an error that is in the current formula. OSHA seeks public comment on any other
areas in the Marine Terminal standard that are affected because of the changes proposed to the Longshoring standard
in this rulemaking.

VII. Other Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. OSHA is raising the issue of the possible harmful effects of diesel exhaust on employees, especially those employees
who work Ro/Ro vessels where exposure to such exhaust is probably the greatest. OSHA is aware that studies have been
done concerning the effects of diesel exhaust by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) in the mining industry.
OSHA is not aware of any studies relating to the longshoring industry, (although the International Cargo Handling
and Coordination Association (ICHCA) is in the process of drafting a paper entitled ``Fumes in Ships'', which will
address this topic), and requests the public to submit pertinent information. OSHA requests information of the following:
1. What are the health effects of diesel exhaust? 2. What are the typical timeframes where employees are exposed to
diesel exhaust? 3. Is mechanical ventilation sufficient to eliminate any harmful effects? 4. What other methods
can be employed to reduce any harmful effects?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. OSHA is aware of the problem of picking up the chassis and fifth wheel along with the container due to the failure of
the container and chassis to separate during a loading operation. This is due to one or more of the chassis's twistlocks
being in the locked position or one or more of the twist locks ``hanging up'' while in the unlocked position. Unfortunately,
the driver of the fifth wheel is in the cab as it is being lifted and often sustains injuries when the cab and chassis fall
back to the ground before the crane operator can lower everything back down. OSHA requests information on the following
questions: 1) How frequently does this problem occur;? 2) OSHA believes this is primarily a problem on the West Coast.
Is this true and why;? 3) OSHA is aware of several devices that have been developed to shut the crane down once the device
detects the fifth wheel being raised off the ground. OSHA seeks information on the effectiveness of these devices
in eliminating the problem, and the cost to purchase and install these devices; 4) Are there other ways to eliminate
the problem, such as better ``monitoring'' of the chassis twistlocks under the hook through training and work practices,
or requiring the driver to get out of the cab until the container is lifted clear of the chassis?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. OSHA has long recognized the utility of comprehensive occupational safety and health programs, and adopted non-mandatory
guidance for safety and health program management on January 26, 1989 (54 FR 3904). These guidelines were based on
a distillation of safety and health management practices used by employers that have implemented successful comprehensive
programs. The major elements OSHA identified in the guidelines for effective occupational safety and health programs
are: 1) management commitment and employee involvement; 2) worksite analysis to anticipate and identify potential
hazards; 3) hazard prevention and control; and 4) safety and health training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Successfully implemented programs generally result in facilities that have a lower incidence of occupationally
related illnesses and injuries. In particular, OSHA has found that companies which have implemented comprehensive
safety and health programs and are participating in its Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) have lost-workday rates
that range from one-fifth to one-third the rates experienced by average worksites within their industrial classification.
In addition, participating sites have reported improved employee morale, product quality, and productivity as
some of the secondary benefits of their safety and health management activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Occupational safety and health standards and guidelines, whether mandatory or developed as voluntary consensus
activities, traditionally have tended to focus on specific problems or hazards rather than taking a broad, program-oriented
approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years, however, OSHA has promulgated a number of generic standards that have program requirements. There
is now increasing evidence that a requirement for all employers to address occupational safety and health programmatically
can provide an effective supplement to specific hazard-related requirements, and provides an added degree of safety
and health for employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Properly designed and implemented comprehensive programs focus the attention of both employers and employees on
safety and health in the workplace. With increased awareness of safety and health concerns, and the commitment to
alleviate the hazards by implementing appropriate controls, workplace-related safety and health injuries and
illnesses are expected to decrease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the specific elements of existing comprehensive occupational safety and health (COSH) programs may vary,
the general concept is the same. COSH programs are designed to coordinate and integrate all facets of occupational
safety and health into the management practices for the facility. Rather than addressing problems on a one-by-one
basis, implementation of a COSH program requires company management to systematically review all hazards in the
facility, and develop a plan to prevent or control them. All employees of the facility must be involved in the development
and implementation of the plan, and there must be a company-wide commitment to controlling or eliminating occupational
safety and health problems. The program is implemented on a continuing basis, that is, there are provisions for ensuring
that the situation in the facility is monitored on a regular basis to ensure that the program is working. Program evaluation
activities to assess effectiveness are also part of the concept. The logic of this approach is simple_prevent adverse
effects from occurring by identifying hazards, and implementing a plan to eliminate or minimize them. By doing this
systematically, resources are not duplicated or wasted, and a coordinated, integrated strategy can be implemented.
Effective functioning of such a program depends largely on the commitment and involvement of all members of the organization,
beginning with the highest level of management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes the COSH program approach can be applied in any establishment, and in any size facility. The complexity
of the specific program in a particular establishment will depend on the nature of the business, the number of employees,
and the types of hazards present. While the basic components of a COSH program would be the same in, for example, a marine
terminal and an automobile manufacturing plant shop, the methods used to implement them would vary based on the different
needs of the facilities. Every type and size of establishment should nevertheless have a systematic approach to addressing
occupational safety and health concerns. All workplaces, from office situations to health care facilities, restaurants
to stevedoring operations, can benefit from the development and implementation of an appropriate COSH program.

Request for Comments and Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA is raising this issue to solicit public input on COSH programs. The Agency is particularly interested in learning
about the experiences of employers who have already implemented such programs, and those of employees who work in
facilities where these programs have been implemented. The purpose of collecting these comments is to determine
whether OSHA should adopt mandatory requirements for comprehensive occupational safety and health programs; what
the components of such programs should be; what problems employers have had in implementing such programs, and what
can be done to alleviate those problems; the benefits of implementing COSH programs; methods that can be used to evaluate
the effectiveness of the programs; the costs and economic feasibility of such programs; the impacts on small businesses;
and suggestions regarding existing OSHA rules that could be consolidated or modified as a result of promulgating
requirements for mandatory COSH programs.

Format of Questions and Responses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific questions asked are designed to elicit the information OSHA believes would be helpful in determining
appropriate elements for COSH programs in longshoring work. The questions are in some cases directed towards specific
audiences, such as employers who have implemented programs. Other questions have more general applicability. Interested
persons may also submit other information or opinions which they believe are relevant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA asks that commenters respond to the specific questions enumerated, and to number responses in accordance with
the number of the question to which the response is addressed. In addition, it would also be helpful for OSHA to receive
copies of written materials to supplement these responses, such as copies of written programs, examples of forms
used, and sample evaluations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) OSHA would like to receive information and data regarding the respondents to this notice in order to properly profile
the responses. If you are submitting comments in response to this notice on behalf of an employer or group of employers
that have implemented a COSH program, or employee or group of employees working in such a facility, please provide
the following specific information. If you are not one of either of these groups, please indicate your role or relation
to COSH programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a) The size of the facility by number of employees;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b) When the program was implemented;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c) Why the program was implemented (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., voluntary decision, state requirements, insurance carrier's requirements, etc.);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d) What the major components of the existing program are;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e) What the initial and annual costs of implementing each of these components have been, and how you derived these costs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f) What resources have been required to operate the programs; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g) What cost savings, illness or injury reductions, or other benefits (e.g., changes in productivity, absenteeism,
turnover, insurance, etc.) have accrued due to implementation of the program, and how you derived these benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Components of a COSH Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, OSHA has published and distributed guidelines for safety and health management programs which
include four major elements. OSHA would like comments on whether these elements are appropriate; whether more specific
information should be provided regarding what should be addressed under each of these elements; and what other elements
may be appropriate for inclusion in COSH programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Management commitment and employee involvement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The first element included in the guidelines is management commitment and employee involvement, or management
leadership. Management commitment is expected to be stated in a worksite policy which outlines the organization's
priority on safety and health, and indicates who has primary responsibility for implementation of various aspects
of the policy. Other facets of this element include establishing and communicating clear goals and objectives for
the program; providing visible management involvement; ensuring employee involvement; providing adequate authority
and resources for those responsible; holding those responsible accountable; ensuring contract workers are protected;
and reviewing and evaluating the program at least annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) Please comment on the inclusion of management commitment and employee involvement as a major element of a COSH program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been OSHA's experience and that there is no situation where these considerations are inappropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) Is this a common program component? How is it implemented? Is the program integrated into the overall management
of the workplace? How well does this work? 4) Who is responsible for managing the program? What skills and knowledge
must this person have to be the program manager? What is the role of the President or Chief Executive Officer? The facility
manager? The supervisor? The employee? Do performance evaluations include an assessment of performance with regard
to safety and health? Are managers and employees held accountable for safety and health performance? How?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5) Are written policy statements prepared and distributed? Please provide examples. Are there situations where
a program can operate effectively without having a written plan?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6) What was the primary motivation for implementing the program (e.g., voluntary, state requirements)? Have insurance
companies encouraged adoption of COSH programs? How was this done?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7) How is employee involvement ensured in existing programs? Are labor-management committees used? If so, please
provide details about how the committees are formed and are operating. What other suggestions do you have for ensuring
employee involvement?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8) How are existing programs evaluated to determine whether or not they are effective? Are worksite program audits
conducted? What do the audits include? How often are workplace conditions reevaluated after the initial assessment?
Please provide copies of any evaluation procedures that may be available. What are the criteria for determining that
the program is or is not effective? What type of evidence is required to demonstrate that each program element has been
implemented? Is the program integrated into the overall management of the workplace?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9) Have any problems been encountered in implementing this element in existing programs? If so, how were these problems
solved? Is the guidance provided in the voluntary guidelines sufficient to implement this element appropriately?
What other information would be useful?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Worksite analysis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The second element in the guidelines is worksite analysis. Employers must identify all worksite hazards by conducting
an initial and subsequent periodic comprehensive baseline worksite surveys for safety and health. The surveys would
vary by the type of workplace, and the nature of the hazards present, but would include an assessment of both safety
and health hazards. Examples of situations that would have to be assessed would include: exposure to chemicals; exposure
to noise, radiation, or other physical hazards; ergonomics hazards; procedures to handle chemicals that have physical
effects such as flammability and reactivity; machine guarding; shoring of trenches; and potential for falls. Programs
must include provisions for regular worksite inspections to determine if existing controls are working, and to identify
uncontrolled hazards; investigations of accidents, or other unusual incidents; analysis of planned and new facilities,
processes, materials and equipment; job hazard analysis; an employee hazard reporting system; and analysis of injury
and illness trends.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10) Do existing programs you are familiar with include worksite analysis? How is it implemented, and who is responsible
for doing it? Please provide examples of how this element is being implemented in existing programs. What criteria
are used to determine what hazards are present? Are there OSHA standards, guidelines, or other documents you can recommend
to assist employers? What do you consider to be the most significant hazard in the workplace?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11) Do existing programs include chemical exposure assessments as part of the worksite analysis process? Should
further guidance be provided for exposure assessment? What criteria for exposure assessment are used in existing
programs? Is exposure monitoring conducted? What criteria are used to determine when monitoring is to be done? Who
is performing exposure monitoring? What training or background did they have to prepare them for this? Are other types
of hazards subject to monitoring (such as noise, radiation)? What criteria are used to monitor these hazards?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12) Do existing programs include an ergonomics component? How are ergonomics problems identified? What criteria
are used? Who does the evaluation, and what is their relevant training or background?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13) Has any illness/injury trend analysis been undertaken in facilities with COSH programs? What have the trends
shown? What action was taken as a result of the findings? Please provide any trend data you have to demonstrate the effect
of such programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14) What problems have been encountered in implementing this element in existing programs? How were these problems
solved? Is the guidance provided in the voluntary guidelines sufficient to implement this element appropriately?
What other information would be useful?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hazard prevention and control. Once the hazards have been identified, the third element the COSH program must address
is hazard prevention and control. The current and potential hazards must be corrected or controlled in a timely manner,
using engineering techniques where feasible and appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures for working safely are to be established, and all affected parties must understand and follow them. Personal
protective equipment is to be made available where appropriate; administrative controls are to be used when necessary;
provision is to be made for repair and maintenance of equipment; emergency preparedness is to be addressed; and a medical
program must be available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15) Do existing programs you are familiar with include hazard prevention and control? How is it implemented, and who
is responsible for doing it? Please provide examples of how this element is being implemented in existing programs.
In particular, please provide any available information about how hazards and risks are defined, and how risk reduction
goals are set. Who decides what control measures are implemented? What criteria are used? Does the program include
an evaluation of occupational safety and health implications when new facilities, processes, materials, or equipment
are planned?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16) Do existing programs include standard operating procedures for repair and maintenance?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17) Are their programs for emergency preparedness? If so, how are they compiled and made available? Is there a plan
for emergency response? If so, what types of emergencies are addressed? Please provide samples of your standard operating
procedures and emergency preparedness and response plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18) Is a medical program available? What is the scope of the program, e.g. does it cover assessments related to workplace
conditions, wellness programs, etc.? Are medical services provided in-house, or are they contracted out? What types
of health professionals are involved in delivering occupational health services? What are their respective roles
and what is their relevant training or background?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19) Does the medical program include preplacement medical surveillance? Periodic medical surveillance? What criteria
are used to determine what surveillance is done? Who decides what surveillance is to be done? Are medical records reviewed
to determine if there are trends in injuries and illnesses? Who conducts the review? What is done with the results?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20) Have problems been encountered in implementing this element in existing programs? If so, how were these problems
solved? Is the guidance provided in the voluntary guidelines sufficient to implement this element appropriately?
What other information would be useful?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Safety and health training
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The last major element in the voluntary guidelines for COSH programs is safety and health training. In order to ensure
that the program works effectively, all employees must be trained to understand the safety and health concerns in
their workplace; the plan to minimize or eliminate those concerns; and their roles in implementation of the plan.
This includes training for those in supervisory or management roles. Responsibilities must be clearly described,
and the lines of authority appropriately drawn. OSHA has published Voluntary Training Guidelines to provide employers
with information about designing and implementing an appropriate safety and health training program. (See Training
Requirements in OSHA Standards and Training Guidelines, OSHA 2254 (Revised), 1992.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21) Do existing programs include safety and health training? How is it implemented, and who is responsible for performing
and implementing it? Please provide examples of how this element is being implemented in existing programs, including
the type of training, such as classroom instruction, on-the-job work practices training, videotapes, or interactive
videos. Does the type of training vary with the type of operation? Have OSHA's Voluntary Training Guidelines been
used in designing and implementing the safety and health training program?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22) Is safety and health training conducted prior to workplace assignment? What does it include in this situation?
Are training requirements for various programs combined into one training program? Approximately how long does
the initial training take for managers? For supervisors? For other workers? Is periodic training conducted? How
often? How long does periodic training take? What is included in the periodic training?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23) Do you have workers who are subject to training certification requirements? How has this worked?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24) Is the training evaluated to determine whether or not it is effective? How is this done?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25) What qualifications do the trainers have?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26) Have problems been encountered in implementing this element in existing programs? If so, how were these problems
solved? Is the guidance provided in the voluntary guidelines sufficient to implement this element appropriately?
What other information would be useful?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Issues Related to Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If OSHA determines that it would be appropriate to promulgate a standard for COSH programs, there are a number of other
issues which will have to be addressed. Comments from the public are solicited on the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27) Should the voluntary guidelines OSHA issued in 1989 be the primary basis for any future regulatory activity in
this area? Based on your experiences, what modifications to the guidelines would be necessary in order for OSHA to
use them as a basis for regulation? Are there additional elements that should be included in a COSH program? What other
information do you think employers would need to implement an appropriate program?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28) The current guidelines are very generally written, and OSHA believes they can be applied in any type of industry
or workplace. Do you think that industry-specific guidelines are required? If so, what should the breakdown be, and
what is the rationale for different program requirements?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29) The current guidelines are also applicable to all sizes of industries. Do you think that small businesses should
be treated differently? If so, why, and in what way?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30) It has been suggested that if OSHA promulgates requirements for COSH programs, there are existing OSHA standards
that could be revised, modified, consolidated, or otherwise changed as a result. Without diminishing employee protections
under current OSHA standards, what rules do you think could be reconsidered if the Agency promulgates a new rule requiring
COSH programs? Commenters are requested to be specific, and provide the rationale for any suggestions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31) If OSHA promulgates a rule for COSH programs, what type of outreach or compliance assistance materials would you
suggest be made available to employers? What would be the most effective way for OSHA to reach small employers who do
not belong to trade associations or professional societies?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
D. OSHA is aware of the increased usage of Flexible Intermediate Bulk Containers (FIBC's) which are used to handle
bulk chemical solids. Some of the FIBC's are designed only to be used for one voyage while others are designed for repeated
usage. OSHA wishes to know: 1) What means are used to mark and identify the one use only type of FIBC, and are they adequate?
and 2) What are the current industry practices regarding the testing of FIBC's and should OSHA incorporate them into
this regulation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. OSHA issued a standard for the control of hazardous energy sources (lockout/tagout) that applied to general industry
employment under 29 CFR part 1910 as 1910.147 (54 FR 36645). This standard addresses practices and procedures that
are necessary to disable machinery or equipment and to prevent the release of potentially hazardous energy while
maintenance and servicing activities are being performed. The standard requires that lockout be utilized for equipment
which is designed with a lockout capacity, and tagout may be used for equipment which was not designed to be locked out.
Servicing and maintenance activities are necessary adjuncts to the industrial process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They are needed to maintain the ability of all machines, equipment, or processes to perform their intended functions.
OSHA believes that these types of operations present the employee with the same types of hazards of unexpected activation,
re-energization, or the release of stored energy, regardless of the type of industrial setting. For these reasons,
OSHA is soliciting public comment regarding the appropriateness of including ``The control of hazardous energy
(lockout/tagout)'' in the ``Scope and applicability'' sections of both 29 CFR part 1917 (Marine Terminals) and 29
CFR part 1918 (Longshoring). While OSHA recognizes that marine terminal activities are more likely to contain work
operations where lockout/tagout hazards are present, it also sees the potential to occur in some longshoring related
operations. OSHA wants to know: 1) should 1910.147 be included in Marine Terminals and why or why not, and 2) should
1910.147 be included in longshoring and why or why not?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. As indicated earlier, OSHA contracted a safety expert, A. J. Scardino, to conduct a study of the fall hazards associated
with the cargo handling of intermodal containers. (Ex. 1&hyph;139). The development of the data, that was used in
formulating the opinions and recommendations of this study, involved the visiting and documentation of the activities
at 20 major ports in the United States. Those ports were: Gulfport, MS, Houston, TX, Barbers Cut, TX, Galveston, TX,
Miami, FL, Miami River, FL, Port Everglade, FL, Charleston, SC, Savannah, GA, Norfolk, VA, Portsmith, VA, Elizabeth,
NJ, New Jersey, NJ, Long Beach, CA, Los Angeles, CA, Seattle, WA, Tacoma, WA, Oakland, CA, San Francisco, CA, Honolulu,
HI. As part of the data gathering process the contractor conferred with: members of the Technical Committee of the
National Maritime Safety Association, representatives of Labor Associations, individual Stevedores, Longshore
personnel, and Port representatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the many areas of inquiry that resulted in positive recommendations, the issue of the location of the fixed anchorage
point in relation to the working surface was addressed: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
When feasible the attachment point of the fall protection system shall be located ``above'' the head of the employee.
Every effort should be made to assure that the attachment point for the system is located no lower than the vertical
height position of the harness ``D'' ring. According to ``Humanscale 7a'', for the 50th percentile male, this would
be 1.4 meters (55.4 inches).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In support of this position, the study cites the National Safety Council in its Accident Prevention Manual for Industrial
Operations 9th. Edition
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (the Bible on Safety) states: (p. 347) ``A belt or harness is worthless unless it is being worn at the time that a fall
is possible and attached to a lanyard or fall arrestor with an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
adequate overhead anchorage
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' (Emphasis added; Id. p. 3.) In addition Mr. Scardino indicates the importance of pre-exposure planning by citing
Best's Safety Directory 1994 Edition which states: (p634) ``A fixture point above head height always should be planned.''
(Id.)(Ex. 1&hyph;153).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to current practice, many fall protection systems in use could meet the raised attachment requirement
recommended by Mr. Scardino ``&sect;*&blank;*&blank;* approximately 70 to 75% of the existing operations that
employ various fall protection techniques would be able to meet *&blank;*&blank;*'' the requirement. (Id.) Some
existing systems have attachments to devices that are installed on the work surface. Recommendations addressing
these systems include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of systems that are at foot level, thereby creating a tripping hazard, should be discouraged. If these systems
are to be used, then, the components that make up the system should be of a high visibility color. This field study further
determined that these systems were not reliable and created a sense of false security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While it is recognized that there is in existence, fall protection that does not meet this criteria, steps should be
taken to meet these minimums 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
within a three year period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In light of these recommendations, OSHA wishes to raise an additional issue. To what extent is it necessary and appropriate
to add an additional criteria to those found in 1918.85(k) requiring an elevated anchorage point in order to assure
worker safety.

Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act require OSHA to analyze the costs, benefits, and other consequences
and impacts associated with proposed standards. Consistent with these requirements, OSHA has prepared this regulatory
impact analysis for the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This analysis includes a description of the industries affected by the regulation, an evaluation of the risks addressed,
an assessment of the benefits attributable to the proposed revisions, the determination of the technological feasibility
of the new requirements, the estimation of the costs of compliance with proposed revisions, the determination of
the economic feasibility of compliance with the proposed revisions, and an analysis of the economic and other impacts
associated with this rulemaking.

Affected Industries
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements of the proposed revisions apply to all establishments involved in marine cargo handling. As classified
by the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) manual, this industry consists of establishments in SIC 4491
as well as establishments in other SICs conducting marine cargo handling activities.

Evaluation of Risk and Potential Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An estimated 7,593 injuries and 18 fatalities occur annually during marine cargo handling activities. The proposed
revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards are expected to result in the prevention of 1,262 injuries
and 3 fatalities, annually. Many additional fatalities and injuries would be prevented through full compliance
with existing requirements retained in the proposed standards. Most of the injuries occurring during marine cargo
handling activities could be prevented through compliance with the existing as well as with the proposed standards.
In addition to the unquantifiable benefits associated with the reduction in pain and suffering associated with these
incidents, the prevention of these injuries will result in savings of over $18 million dollars, annually. This estimate
includes savings related to wage and productivity losses, medical costs, administrative expenses, and other costs
associated with accidents.

Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The estimated costs associated with the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards amount
to less than $4.7 million for the first year and less than $1.8 million, annually, after the first year. These costs
primarily reflect the sum of various minor expenditures associated with modifications to existing standards. New
provisions involving compliance costs include requirements for sideboards on dockboards and ramps, required certification
of fall protection systems, requirements for the vertical application of lifting forces to containers, requirements
for high visibility vests, and requirements to provide personal flotation devices, among others.

Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance with the proposed new requirements of the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards has been determined
to be economically feasible and is not expected to produce any significant adverse economic impacts. The costs that
are imposed by the regulation should be a minimal burden on marine cargo handling establishments. The total estimated
first-year costs of compliance represent less than 0.06 percent of revenues associated with marine cargo handling
activities and less than 1.19 percent of profits. Total annualized costs for subsequent years represent less than
0.03 percent of revenues and 0.46 percent of profits.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, OSHA has made an assessment of the impact of the revised standards and
has concluded that it would not have a significant impact upon a substantial number of small entities. The estimated
compliance costs do not involve large capital expenditures, and there is no significant differential effect on small
firms relative to that on large firms.

Overview of Stevedoring and Marine Terminals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Marine terminals are designated areas of ports which include wharves, bulkheads, quays, piers, docks and other berthing
locations. Adjacent storage or contiguous areas associated with the primary movements of cargo or materials from
vessel to shore or shore to vessel, and structures devoted to receiving, handling, holding, consolidating, loading
or delivering waterborne shipments are considered part of the marine terminal. Marine terminals are the facilities
owned or leased by stevedores or marine terminal operators (MTOs). MTOs and stevedores provide most of the portside
services that shipping lines require. They provide the equipment and machinery for conducting cargo handling at
multi-use terminal facilities, in addition to specialized terminals designed to handle specific types of cargo
[2].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stevedores are persons or firms contracting with a ship owner or agent for the purpose of loading or unloading ships
or barges in ports. Stevedores are direct employers of longshore labor and contractors to ship owners. Basically,
they are middlemen between the entity requiring the service and the longshore workers who perform the physical labor.
The stevedore's role is to provide the cargo handling expertise and the equipment required to load or unload all types
of cargo safely and efficiently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The stevedore may also be the MTO. The functional roles and activities of stevedores and MTOs vary throughout the United
States and often cannot be distinguished. The stevedore contractor and the MTO may be distinctly different entities,
the same entity, or corporately related. In some cases, public entities or port authorities may be the MTOs. These
entities may also act as stevedores or lease the terminals to private operators [2].

Workplaces Affected
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance with the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards will affect two areas where
marine cargo handling operations occur. Activities that occur off the dock (work aboard vessels) are covered under
OSHA's Longshoring standard (29 CFR part 1918) and those which occur on the dock fall under the Marine Terminals standard
(29 CFR part 1917). The Longshoring standard covers establishments classified under SIC 4491 (marine cargo handling),
as well as various establishments in manufacturing; transportation; communications; electric, gas and sanitary
services; and wholesale trade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data on the exact number of stevedoring companies currently operating in the United States are not available. For
the purposes of this analysis, the number of marine terminals estimated by the Maritime Administration (MARAD) was
used as the estimate of the total number of firms affected by the Longshoring standard. According to MARAD, there are
a total of 3,700 marine terminals in the United States [4]. Establishments engaged primarily in marine cargo handling
are classified under Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 4491, Marine Cargo Handling. The Bureau of the Census
estimated that 746 establishments are classified under SIC 4491 [7]. To identify other affected industry sectors,
Kearney/Centaur screened OSHA inspection data for non-SIC 4491 sectors where 29 CFR part 1918 citations were issued.
Non-SIC 4491 establishments primarily engage in activities other than longshoring, although longshore work is
a small part of their overall operation. For example, manufacturing establishments which load their products directly
onto barges are covered by the OSHA's Longshoring standard, though these operations represent only a very small part
of their total activity. Kearney/Centaur estimated the distribution of the remaining establishments among affected
industry sectors according to the distribution of non-SIC 4491 29 CFR part 1918 citations issued in other sectors.
The estimated number of affected establishments is shown in Table B-1 by industry and in Table B-2 by region. Although
only 20 percent of establishments affected by the longshoring standard are in SIC 4491, the majority of affected workers,
as discussed below, are accounted for in SIC 4491.

Of the industry sectors covered by the Longshoring standard, most also fall under the scope of the Marine Terminals
standard, with the exception of manufacturing establishments and some wholesale trade establishments. Approximately
1,928 of the 3,700 marine terminals covered by the Longshoring standard are estimated to fall under the scope of the
Marine Terminals standard [1].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The stevedore/MTO typically hires longshore workers, usually on a daily basis, from a hiring hall or labor pool of
union or nonunion members. Labor force size varies directly with the amount of work contracted to be performed. This
method of hiring creates difficulty in determining the size of the affected establishments. No data were available
on the number of small stevedoring firms. To estimate the number of small firms, the percent of establishments in SIC
4491 classified by the Bureau of the Census as employing fewer than 20 workers, is used. Fifty-six percent of affected
establishments are estimated to be small establishments [7].

This discussion describes the affected vessels calling at U.S. marine terminals. The proposed rule will be applicable
to five broad vessel categories. Four of these categories are self-propelled vessels: bulk carriers, freighters,
combination passenger/cargo ships, and cruise ships. The fifth category consists of non-self-propelled dry cargo
barges. Descriptions of these vessel categories, as well as important subcategories, are presented in Tables B-3
and B-4. Tankers and tanker barges are excluded since these vessels are primarily under the jurisdiction of the U.S.
Coast Guard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large mostly double hulled cargo holds lacking an internal means of propulsion. Virtually all barges used on the inland
river system are 195 feet long by 35 feet wide and have loaded drafts of up to nine feet. Barges can carry virtually any
dry cargo and have and average capacity of 1,500 tons or about 52,500 bushels. Also classified as barges are scows and
ocean-going barges. These barges tend to be much larger and have a higher freeboard than barges used on the inland river
system.

Barges are typically lashed together in groups referred to as tows. The standard tow on most navigable rivers is three
barges wide by five barges long for a total of 15 barges. Tow sizes, however, vary by waterway with tows as large as 45
barges on the lower Mississippi and as small as two barges on the intracoastal waterway. Tows are usually propelled
by a towboat pushing them ahead, though occasionally they are moved by a towboat pulling them on a hawser.

Table B&hyph;5 shows the number of self-propelled vessels of 1,000 gross tons (GTs) and over in the world fleet, by
type of vessel. Of the 692 U.S. flag vessels, approximately two-thirds are privately owned and the remaining one-third
are Government owned. Only 11 of the 225 Government owned vessels were active as of mid&hyph;1992 and were being used
by several Government agencies, state maritime academies, or private steamship companies under various forms of
agreement with the Maritime Administration. All U.S. flag vessels are owned either by the Government or U.S. firms.
However, U.S. firms also own a substantial number of merchant vessels that are registered under foreign flags. As
shown in Table B&hyph;5, 313 of the 23,549 foreign flag vessels are owned by U.S. parent companies. Although no data
were available on the total number of self-propelled vessels in the world fleet of under 1,000 Gts, data were available
on the number of vessels calling at U.S. ports. According to Bureau of the Census data [5], approximately 1,980 U.S.
flag and 9,593 foreign flag self-propelled vessels called at U.S. ports in 1992.

The total number of non-self-propelled vessels is shown in Table B&hyph;6. Of the 31,017 non-self propelled vessels,
87 percent are dry cargo barges, 13 percent are tanker barges, and less than 1 percent are railroad car floats. Nearly
86 percent of all non-self-propelled vessels in the United States operate on the domestic river and intracoastal
waterway system and carry nearly all of the waterborne cargo transported on the inland waterways. Thirteen percent
of the non-self-propelled vessels (4,158 vessels) in the United States operate on the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific
coasts. The remaining 1 percent of non-self-propelled vessels operate in the Great Lakes.

Containers and Container-Carrying Vessels
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Over recent years, there has been an increase in the volume of containerized cargo handled. Containers are large,
standard size metal boxes, equipped with corner castings, into which cargo is packed for shipment. Containers are
designed to be moved with common handling equipment enabling economical, high-speed intermodal transfers in large
units between ships, railcars, truck chassis, and barges, using a minimum of labor. The container, therefore, serves
as the transfer unit rather than the cargo contained therein. Most containers in the U.S. inventory are either 20-foot
(6.1 m) containers (56 percent) or 40-foot containers (12.2 m) (42 percent).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Containerships are vessels equipped with permanent container cells. They have little or no space for other types
of cargo. Partial containerships are multi-purpose ships where one or more, but not all, compartments are fitted
with permanent container cells. The remaining compartments are used for other types of cargo. Several other types
of vessels also carry containers.

Vessels in liner service operate on fixed routes to advertised ports on published schedules. As shown in the table,
1,020 container-carrying liner service vessels with a total container capacity of approximately 1.7 million TEUs
(twenty-foot equivalent units) called at U.S. ports in 1992. Virtually all containerships, partial containerships,
bulk/containerships, RO RO/containerships and barge carriers are in liner service, and essentially, the entire
container capacity of these types of vessels are accounted for in liner services. Break bulk freighters and RO-RO
ships also carry containers. Although RO-RO ships are generally in liner service, break bulk carriers are not. Data
on the number and container capacity of non-liner service break bulk carriers were unavailable. However, based on
the proportion of container traffic accounted for by break bulk freighters, the estimated number of voyages made
annually to the United States by these vessels, and their average container capacity, Kearney/Centaur estimated
that 544 non-liner service break bulk freighters with a container capacity of 78,336 containers called at U.S. ports
in 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Combining the number of liner service and non-liner service container-carrying vessels, OSHA therefore estimates
that a total of 1,564 container-carrying vessels, with an overall container capacity of 1.76 million TEUs, call annually
at U.S. ports [1].

estimated that about 70,140 of these workers would also be covered by the Marine Terminals standard, 78 percent of
which are in SIC 4491. Estimates of full-time equivalent workers, as well as the population at risk are shown in Table

Wages

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Wages of longshore workers vary among regions and ports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two primary factors account for this variation. First, local union contractual agreements vary in wage rates, holidays,
and other rules or benefits which affect the wages and earnings of longshore workers. Second, the number of hours worked
per year varies by port and region, resulting in variations in overtime wage payments. The average national wage rate
of longshore workers, including overtime and benefits, is estimated to be $40.30 per hour. The average supervisor
wage rate, including overtime and benefits, is estimated at $50.78 [1].

Statistics on shipping costs were estimated based on vessel operating revenue data for domestic water carriers compiled
by The U.S. Department of Transportation. Table B-11 presents operating revenues and tonnage data, by region, for
1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As shown, operating revenues were nearly $3.0 billion for Coastal regions, $2.9 billion for Inland waterways, and
$0.6 billion for the Great Lakes region. The operating revenues per ton of freight hauled were $10.27, $4.57 and $5.33,
respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost for shipping a 40-foot (12.0 m) container with FAK (freight-of-all-kinds) worth $100,000 and weighing 10
long tons from New York to Rotterdam was estimated to range from $277.40 to $300.50 per long ton. The cost for the same
shipment from Los Angeles to Tokyo was estimated to range from $243.60 to $288.30 per long ton [1].

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A side-by-side comparison of the proposed and existing rules was conducted to identify revisions to the existing
rules. In addition, a profile of current industry practices was developed to enable estimates of incremental compliance
costs to be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data used in this preliminary analysis of compliance costs were obtained from three studies conducted in 1986,
1989 and in 1994 by OSHA's contractor, Kearney/Centaur. In 1986 and 1989, analyses were performed on proposed requirements
identified as changes to existing standards. These studies were conducted through field visits and telephone surveys
of U.S. ports. The 1994 study was conducted to update information collected in previous studies and to collect information
on the impact of proposed revisions made recently to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards. Efforts included
interviews with industry officials to gather information on key cost issues, and calls to equipment manufacturers,
suppliers, and professional service providers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three general types of costs were identified: first-year costs, capital costs, and recurring annual costs. First-year
costs are training and workplace analysis costs that which are expected to be incurred in the first year after promulgation
of a final rule. Capital costs are costs for equipment with a working life of more than one year. Recurring annual costs
are costs that will be incurred each year after promulgation of a final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of compliance costs are expected to be borne directly by stevedoring companies, although vessel operators
may incur some short-term costs.

Proposed revisions to the existing Longshoring standard will result in general costs for workplace analysis and
training. Total first-year costs for these activities are estimated at $1,607,563, and will most likely be borne
by stevedoring firms.

Workplace Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Workplace analysis involves evaluating an establishment to determine what needs to be done to achieve compliance
with the proposed rule. Preliminary costs for this activity are estimated using the hourly wage rate of a safety consultant
or safety engineer. The average hourly fee for a safety consultant is estimated to be $87.50, based on a range of $50
to $125 per hour [1]. The average time per establishment to have a safety consultant conduct such an analysis is estimated
to be about an hour and a half [1]. This yields an average cost per facility of $131.25. The total first-year workplace
analysis cost across all 3,700 affected establishments is estimated to be $485,625. This cost will most likely be
borne by stevedoring firms.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 -->
Training
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First-year costs will be necessary to train supervisors on the new requirements of the proposed rule. No recurring
annual training costs are estimated since interviews with industry officials indicated that longshore supervisors
receive regular safety training, and training in new requirements will replace safety training related to the existing
rule. Kearney/Centaur field visits, and telephone interviews with longshore safety experts and industry officials
revealed that supervisors will assure implementation of proposed requirements. No additional training time will
be required for longshore workers. The proposed rule will result in three types of training: (1) general training
in new requirements; (2) additional safety training for RO-RO and containerized operations; and (3) accident prevention
proficiency training for supervisors overseeing five or more workers. The costs of additional training for container
and RO-RO operations, and accident prevention proficiency training will be discussed under the appropriate subparts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA assumes that first-year supplementary general training will be required to familiarize supervisors with the
new requirements of the proposed rule. The number of supervisors that will need general training is estimated using
a 10 to 1 employee to supervisor ratio. As discussed in the Industry Profile, approximately 93,427 workers are estimated
to be at risk. Hence, 9,343 supervisors are estimated to require general training. Kearney/Centaur estimated that
less than one hour of training, in addition to regular safety training, will be necessary to train each supervisor.
Using an average supervisor wage rate of $50.78, the total first-year cost of supervisor time to receive general training
is estimated at $474,438.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the cost of supervisor training time, the cost to provide safety instruction is estimated. The fee for
an instructor is estimated to be about $175 per hour of training [1]. The total cost for general safety instruction
is estimated at $647,500.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Most of the proposed revisions to this subpart are not expected to impose additional costs on affected establishments.
For example, proposed requirements for portable ladders are already addressed in the existing Marine Terminals
standard. Since portable ladders used on the vessel are typically the same ladders used on the dock, no incremental
costs are expected to be incurred. No additional costs are expected to result from requiring 6 inches (15.2 cm) or more
of clearance in the back of ladder rungs. This requirement can be met using portable ladders, which are currently available
on-site [1].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed requirement for 6 inch (15.2 cm) sideboards on dockboards and ramps is expected to impose additional
costs on stevedoring firms. Based on Kearney/Centaur interviews with regional industry representatives, approximately
1,070 ramps will need to be retrofitted at a unit cost of $1,000 [1]. The incremental capital cost for this provision
is estimated at $1,070,000.

In the existing rule, 29 CFR 1918.32(b) requires fall protection for workers exposed to fall hazards at the edge of
a hatch section or stowed cargo over 8 feet (2.4 m) high. Although changes to the regulatory text are being proposed
for clarification purposes, the proposed language does not impose additional responsibilities upon employers.
Hence, no incremental costs are attributed to this provision. This is consistent with court interpretations, as
found by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission in its decision of October 24, 1979, OSHRC Docket No.
15242 concerning 1918.32(b) citation of Seattle Crescent Container Service, and the decision of the U.S. Court of
Appeals, Ninth Circuit in Long Beach Container Terminal Inc. v. OSHRC and Brock, February 23, 1987.

Proposed revisions to Subpart D also include requirements for ``walking sticks'' (floating walking and working
surfaces) for employees working logs out of the water. However, local rules in ports affected by this requirement
currently include these requirements, and affected establishments are already in compliance [1].

The proposed rule includes several revisions to this subpart. Proposed revisions impose more restrictions on working
spaces along coamings, more flexibility on covering hatches with tarpaulins, and more flexibility on securing hatch
covers. The proposed revisions would also require that all unsecured materials be removed before moving hatch covers.
Such changes in work practices are not expected to result in incremental costs other than first-year costs for general
training discussed earlier in this chapter [1].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This subpart covers all employer-provided gear and equipment used in longshoring operations aboard vessels. The
majority of the gear used aboard vessels is also used on the dock. To the extent that proposed revisions to the Longshoring
standard covering this gear are addressed by the existing Marine Terminals standard, no incremental costs are estimated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would require that all special stevedoring gear purchased or fabricated 90 days or more after publication
of a final rule, and having a safe working load of 5 short tons or over, be certified by an OSHA accredited agency in accordance
with 29 CFR part 1919. Most gear covered under this subpart is either also used on the dock and therefore, already required
to be certified under 29 CFR 1917.50, or already certified prior to purchase by the manufacturer. Although situations
do arise in which special gear is manufactured and used only on the vessel, such occurrences are rare and the overall
cost to affected establishments is expected to be minimal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two requirements, however, are expected to impose costs on affected establishments. The proposed requirements
for the quadrennial testing of special stevedoring gear and the lockout/tagout of powered conveyors are expected
to generate compliance costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA assumes that only the 746 establishments classified under SIC 4491 will be affected by the proposed requirement
for quadrennial testing of special gear and equipment. Testing is estimated to take an average of five hours per affected
establishment. Assuming that a designated person with an average wage rate of $40.30 will do the testing, the average
cost per establishment is estimated to be $201.50 every four years, or $50.38 annually. The total annual cost for affected
establishments to comply with this provision is estimated at $37,583 [1].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance costs are also expected to result from the proposed revision requiring the lockout/tagout of powered
conveyors. Those conveyors with master shut-off switches used only aboard vessels and not on the dock will be affected.
Kearney/Centaur estimated that existing switches on a total of 60 powered conveyors would need to be replaced by general
duty 240 volt/100 amp, 3 pole, fused, lockable safety switches. The unit cost for switch replacement, including installation
charges, is estimated to be $315 each ($130 for materials cost, $112 direct labor, $73 overhead and other charges)
[1]. OSHA estimates that the total capital cost associated with the lockout/tagout of powered conveyors is $18,900.
This cost will most likely be borne by stevedoring firms.

Nine proposed revisions to the existing rule were identified as substantive changes to the existing rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 -->
Vertical Lifting of Containers 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule requires that, when containers are being hoisted by the top fittings, lifting forces must be applied
vertically from at least four such fittings. Since container gantry cranes provide vertical lifts, only non-container
cranes will be affected. Stevedores using non-container cranes currently use either box spreaders, or wires and
hooks to lift containers. The use of box spreaders would provide vertical lifts. Approximately 423 non-container
gantry cranes are used to lift containers. However, box spreaders would only need to be purchased for 8 to 20 percent
of these cranes [1]. Approximately one 20 foot (6.1 m) box spreader and one 40 foot (12.2 m) box spreader will need to
be purchased for 59 cranes (14 percent of non-container cranes). Kearney/Centaur estimated, based on an interview
with a box spreader manufacturer, that a 20-foot (6.1 m) box spreader costs about $8,800 and a 40-foot (12.2 m) box spreader
costs about $9,800. The total cost per crane to purchase one 20-foot (6.1 m) box spreader and one 40-foot (12.2 m) box
spreader is, therefore, estimated at $18,600 ($8,800 + $9,800). Thus, the total capital cost that will be incurred
by stevedoring companies to comply with this provision is estimated at $1,101,492 [1].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 -->
Prohibiting Work On Top of Containers to the Extent Feasible
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule would eliminate work on top of container stacks, to the extent feasible, through the use of engineering
controls. Compliance with this proposed requirement is considered feasible, for most operations, when container
gantry cranes are used to move containers. To secure stacked containers, twistlocks are placed in the corner castings
of each container. When manual twistlocks are used, workers are placed, usually by crane, on top of each container
to place or remove (cone or decone) twistlocks. The use of semi-automatic twistlocks (SATLs) and above-deck cell
guides would eliminate the need for workers to go atop containers for the purpose of coning or deconing. These engineering
controls would greatly reduce the time spent on top of containers and thus, reduce the fall hazards. The use of such
controls would also eliminate the need to use personal protective equipment (PPE) for the purposes of coning and deconing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kearney/Centaur conducted a time-motion study comparing the use of SATLs with the use of fall protection using tie-off.
Through field visits to eight ports, Kearney/Centaur observed various container operations on different types
of vessels. Activities that directly affect the total time to complete a project (activities on the critical path)
were identified, and the average time to complete each of these activities was estimated. Operations that delay the
crane are activities on the critical path. The study demonstrated that the use of SATLs would result in significant
decreases in crane delay time, since workers would no longer need to be placed on each container to cone or decone. This
finding is consistent with other studies conducted on the use of SATLs [1, Appendix E]. The unit cost of a SATL is about
$20 more than the cost of a conventional twistlock. Thus, the incremental cost per SATL is estimated to be $20 [1]. An
estimated 177 U.S.-owned vessels and 350 foreign-owned vessels will need to purchase SATLs. The total annualized
investment cost to purchase SATLs is estimated at about $2 million for U.S. vessel operators and $4 million for foreign
operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of SATLs is expected to result in cost savings to vessel operators, as well as to stevedores, in terms of productivity
increases. The total dollar value of the cost savings depends on the time savings per vessel, the vessel configuration,
the number of containers carried, the number of container cranes used to load or unload the vessel, and the number of
trips made to U.S. ports. In each case, as analyzed in Kearney/Centaur's study, cost savings exceed the annualized
cost of purchasing SATLs. Even under the worst case scenario, annual productivity increases more than offset the
annualized investment cost of the SATLs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of SATLs also results in reduced damage to containers. Conventional twistlocks are often thrown or dropped
onto the tops of containers, often damaging them. Since SATLs are placed and removed on the dock, such damage would
be avoided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, interviews with industry officials revealed that shipping lines are already rapidly converting to
the use of SATLs. Approximately 47 to 55 percent of all containerships calling at U.S. ports are currently using SATLs.
An estimated 22 to 26 percent of U.S. flag containerships and 74 to 78 percent of foreign flag containerships currently
use SATLs. In addition, major shipping lines are currently in the process of fully converting to the use of SATLs [1].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, based on the Kearney/Centaur study, the annual productivity gains realized as a result of using of
SATLs are expected to exceed the annualized investment cost to purchase SATLs. OSHA requests additional data and
comments on this issue.

Certification of Fall Protection Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The certification of fall protection systems used in container operations is also expected to result in compliance
costs. The proposed rule would require that all fall protection systems be certified by a registered professional
engineer as being capable of sustaining at least twice the potential impact of an employee's fall. Based on Kearney/Centaur
interviews with industry officials, compliance with this provision would require, on average, one annual certification
per establishment involved in container operations. Each certification is expected to take about two hours. Approximately
277 establishments are estimated to be involved in container operations [1]. The services of a registered professional
engineer to conduct the required testing and provide certification are estimated to cost about $50 per hour, or $100
per establishment, annually. In addition, there may be a $200 documentation fee and a 15 percent administrative surcharge.
This results in an average cost of $345 per establishment, and a total annual recurring cost of $95,565 for stevedoring
firms.

Secondary Attachments for Safety Cages
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed standard requires the use of secondary attachments for safety cages attached to container gantry cranes
which are used to hoist employees. Few safety cages have secondary means of attachment. The installation of padeyes
on cages to allow them to be attached to the spreader by chains and hooks would satisfy this requirement. Approximately
75 to 100 safety cages are currently in use, 90 percent of which lack secondary means of attachment [1]. Applying this
percentage to 88 safety cages (the midpoint of the estimated range of safety cages in use) yields an estimate of 79 cages
that will need to be retrofitted. The installation of padeyes is estimated to cost $200 per safety cage. No costs are
attributed to the purchase of hooks and chains since these items are readily available from existing inventories
of equipment. The total capital cost to comply with this provision is estimated at $15,840. This cost would is likely
to be borne by stevedoring companies [1].

Marking of Load Capacities on RO-RO Ramps
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed provision requiring that RO-RO ramps be marked with their load capacities is expected to impose first-year
costs primarily on vessel operators. Field visits and interviews with industry representatives indicated that
virtually none of the vessels have load capacities marked on their ramps. The Bureau of the Census reported that 147
RO-RO vessels called at U.S. ports in 1992. Approximately 120 of these are RO-RO car carriers, and 27 are heavy capacity
RO-RO vessels. On average, car carriers have about four ramps each and heavy capacity RO-RO vessels have 1.5 ramps
each. Thus, an estimated 521 ramps would need to be marked. Industry officials indicated that this procedure would
require about 0.5 hour per vessel to obtain the necessary information, and 0.5 hour to mark each ramp. Thus, a total
of 334 labor hours would be required. Using a labor rate of $40.30, the total estimated first-year cost for vessel operators
to comply with this requirement is $13,460.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 -->
Separation of Vehicles and Pedestrians on RO-RO Ramps
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule also requires that pedestrians and vehicles be physically separated on RO-RO ramps. When no physical
separation is present or feasible, a signal person would be required to direct traffic, disallowing concurrent use.
Although some heavy capacity RO-RO ramps have pedestrian walkways built into them, most are relatively wide and are
often used concurrently by pedestrians and vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For car carriers, ramps are narrow and many do not have room to designate both a pedestrian walkway and a car lane. Discussions
with car carrier foremen indicated that, currently, a gang member is assigned the duty of directing traffic and coordinating
the movement of vehicles. Consequently, no incremental costs are expected to be incurred for a signal person. However,
decreases in productivity may result since vehicles, which would normally be driven onto ramps when pedestrians
are present, would have to wait until all pedestrians clear the ramp.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kearney/Centaur indicated that productivity decreases would be in the form of additional personnel rather than
vessel delays. Based on the number of vehicles imported to and exported from the United States each year, the probability
that pedestrians and vehicles would concurrently use a ramp, and the average delay time that would result for each
incident, Kearney/Centaur estimated that this proposed requirement would result in a total annual delay time of
about 2,178.7 hours [1]. Applying an average longshore worker wage rate of $40.30 to the total time delay yields a recurring
annual cost of about $87,801.

Marking Flat Bed and Low Boy Trailers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule requires that flat bed and low boy trailers (mafis) be marked with their load capacities. Kearney/Centaur
concluded that the 307 establishments involved in container and RO-RO operations will be affected by this requirement,
80 percent of which are already in compliance [1]. To mark all mafis would take about eight hours per establishment.
Using an average hourly wage rate of $40.30, the first-year incremental cost of this requirement is estimated at $19,795.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 -->
High Visibility Vests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule would require that high visibility vests be used during RO-RO and container operations. Kearney/Centaur
estimated that one vest would be required, annually, for each affected worker [1]. OSHA estimates that about 75 percent
(40,963 workers) of SIC 4491 workers are involved in container or RO-RO operations. The average unit cost of a high
visibility vest is estimated to be $6.50 [1]. Therefore, the annual recurring cost for high visibility vests is estimated
at $266,260.

Additional Training in Container and RO-RO Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Since there are several revisions proposed for container and RO-RO operations, additional training is expected
to be needed. OSHA estimates that 75 percent of longshore workers employed in SIC 4491 (40,963 workers) engage in either
container or RO-RO operations or both. Assuming one supervisor will need to be trained for every 10 workers at risk,
4,096 supervisors will need additional training. Additional training in container and RO-RO operations is not expected
to exceed 0.5 hour [1]. Applying an hourly supervisor wage rate of $50.78 yields a first-year cost of approximately
$103,997.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A first-year cost to provide safety instruction is also estimated. An estimated 307 establishments will need instructors
for container and RO-RO safety training [1]. Using an hourly instruction fee of $175 per hour of training provided,
the estimated instruction cost is $26,863.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total first-year cost for additional container and RO-RO safety training is estimated to be $130,860, and will
most likely be borne by stevedoring firms.

Illumination 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
According to industry officials, most lighting situations meet the proposed requirement of 5 footcandles (54 lux)
of illumination. The existing rule requires that ``adequate'' lighting be provided at all times. OSHA assumes that
establishments not using at least 5 footcandles (54 lux) of lighting would be in violation of the existing rule. Thus,
no incremental costs are estimated for this provision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 -->
Sanitation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed standard includes specifications on the number of toilets that would need to be available to longshore
workers. Kearney/Centaur interviews with industry representatives indicated that current practice already meets
this proposed requirement, with the exception of certain situations in the Gulf region. Compliance with this requirement
can be achieved through semi-monthly rentals of portable toilets at a rental cost of $65 each. The total recurring
annual cost to comply with the proposed sanitation requirements is estimated to be $1,560 for stevedoring companies
operating in the Gulf [1].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 -->
First Aid Kits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule would require that first aid kits be checked at least weekly and that contents be approved by a physician.
Industry officials indicated that first aid kits currently in use are stocked on the basis of recommendations by first
aid and safety professionals and are expected to already meet physicians' recommendations. Thus, kit contents are
not expected to change as a result of proposed revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Incremental costs are expected to result in the form of labor time necessary to perform weekly checks of the contents
of each kit. This procedure is not expected to take more than 5 minutes per week per establishment. Applying an average
hourly wage rate of $40.30 yields an annual cost of $174.63 per establishment per year. The total recurring annual
cost for all 3,700 establishments to comply with this requirement is estimated at $646,143.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 -->
Stretchers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Incremental costs are expected to result from the proposed requirement that stretchers be equipped with four sets
of working patient restraints. Costs are estimated assuming that 25 percent of the affected workplaces would need
to retrofit their stretchers. Approximately one stretcher per establishment would need to be retrofitted at an average
cost of $400 each [1]. The total capital cost for this requirement is estimated at $370,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 -->
Accident Prevention Proficiency Training for Supervisors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule would require that all supervisors overseeing more than five workers complete a course in accident
prevention. This training is currently required under the Marine Terminals standard. Kearney/Centaur field visits
indicated that approximately 75 percent of supervisors already receive accident prevention training [1]. Each
course is estimated to take two hours. At an average supervisor wage rate of $50.78 per hour, the cost for 2,336 supervisors
to receive this training is $237,244. The average fee to provide instruction is estimated to be $175 per hour of training.
Assuming that 25 percent of the affected establishments (925 establishments) would require such training, the cost
for instruction is estimated at $323,750 ($175 x 2 x 925). The total first-year cost for accident prevention proficiency
training is, therefore, estimated to be $560,994 and is expected to be borne by stevedoring companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to first-year costs, annual recurring costs are expected to be incurred as a result of supervisor turnover.
Kearney/Centaur estimated that the turnover rate for longshore supervisors is about five percent per year. The resulting
annual cost of supervisor time is estimated at $11,883. The annual cost to provide instruction is $16,188, assuming
that five percent of establishments would need such instruction. The recurring annual cost for accident prevention
proficiency training is, therefore, estimated at $28,070.

The proposed rule would broaden the existing scope to require that personal flotation devices be used in more situations
where workers may be at risk of falling into the water. Since the existing rule already requires the use of personal
flotation devices in the Gulf/Mississippi region, no incremental costs in addition to general training costs are
expected to be incurred by establishments in this region. To estimate the number of flotation devices that would be
needed, OSHA assumes that 50 percent of employees not working in the Gulf/Mississippi region (19,386 workers), would
need personal flotation devices. The average unit cost per life vest meeting the required specifications is estimated
at $55 [8]. Thus, the total capital cost to purchase personal flotation devices is estimated at $1,066,230.

Revisions to 29 CFR Part 1917: Marine Terminals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Several of the proposed revisions to the Marine Terminals standard are not expected to generate any specific costs.
Some of the costs of the proposed revisions are included in the cost analysis of the proposed Longshoring standard.
For example, the first aid kits and stretchers used for workers aboard vessels are the same ones used in marine terminals.
Also, Kearney/Centaur concluded, based on interviews with industry representatives, that many of the proposed
requirements reflect current practices. For example, current industry practice prohibits riding the load and hoisting
workers by hooks. In addition, industry officials indicated that lowering the 8-hour time-weighted average exposure
limit of carbon monoxide from 50 ppm to 35 ppm would not be a problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with most of the proposed revisions to the Marine Terminals standard can be met through workplace analysis
and general training. Specific compliance costs are expected to be generated from the proposed requirement for seat
belts in high speed container gantry cranes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Costs for workplace analysis and general training are based on the assumption that 1,928 establishments and 70,140
workers (see Industry Profile), would be affected by proposed revisions to the Marine Terminals standard [1]. The
total first-year cost for these activities is estimated at $515,485.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 -->
Workplace Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Approximately one hour, on average, is estimated to be required for a safety consultant, familiar with the proposed
rule, to evaluate an establishment. At an average fee of $87.50 per hour, the total estimated first-year cost for workplace
analysis is $168,700 [1].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 -->
General Training
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
One supervisor per every 10 workers (7,014 supervisors) would receive supplementary general training in the proposed
new requirements. General training in the proposed requirements is estimated to take about 0.5 hour. Using an average
supervisor wage rate of $50.78, the total first-year cost of supervisor time for additional training is estimated
at $178,085. The cost per establishment to provide instruction, using an average fee of $175 per hour of training,
is estimated at $168,700.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the total first-year cost of general training is estimated at $346,785, and will most likely be borne by stevedoring
firms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed rule requires that seat belts be placed in the operators' seats of high-speed container gantry cranes.
Kearney/Centaur estimated that 40 percent of the 411 container gantry cranes in U.S. ports are already equipped with
chest harnesses. Based on interviews, the cost to retrofit one crane is estimated at $500. The total capital cost to
retrofit 247 container cranes is estimated to be $123,500.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed revisions to the Marine Terminals standard are estimated to result in first-year costs totalling $535,585
and annualized costs totalling $20,099 (Table C&hyph;3).

Introduction

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards are expected to reduce the numbers of injuries
and fatalities in the marine cargo handling industry. Since affected workers are involved in both off-the-dock (covered
under 29 CFR part 1918) and on-the-dock activities (covered under 29 CFR part 1917), separate analyses are presented
on accidents that occur in each area of operation.

Injuries and Fatalities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
As presented in the Industry Profile, approximately 87,951 full-time equivalent (FTE) longshore workers, based
on a 1,436 hour work-year, are affected by the Longshoring standard. Approximately 67,974 of these workers are also
covered by the Marine Terminals standard. About 54,617 of affected workers are employed in SIC 4491, while the others
are employed in establishments classified under other industry sectors. A summary of injuries occurring among affected
workers in the marine cargo handling industry is shown in Table D-1. As shown, a total of 18 fatalities and 7,593 injuries
occurred among workers affected by the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provided the 1991 injury rate for SIC 4491. This rate was 13.6 for every 100 FTE
workers, based on a 2000 hour work-year [1]. The lost workday and non-lost workday injury rates per 100 FTE workers
were 8.4 and 5.2, respectively. An average of 38.9 lost workdays occurred per lost workday injury.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BLS also conducted a study of longshore-related injuries processed under the Federal Longshoremen's and Harbor
Workers' Compensation Act [9]. According to this study, 49 percent of longshore-related injuries occurred off the
dock, while 51 percent occurred on the dock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since BLS injury rates are per 100 FTE workers based on a 2,000 hour work-year, the number of FTE workers based on a 1,436
hour work-year must be converted to FTEs based on a 2,000-hour work-year. The conversion results in 63,148 FTE off-the-dock
workers and 48,805 FTE on-the-dock workers.

Off-the-Dock
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of off-the-dock injuries was estimated by applying 49 percent of the BLS injury rate to the 63,148 FTE off-the-dock
workers (based on a 2,000 hour work-year). As a result, 4,208 annual injuries are estimated to occur off the dock. Of
these, 2,599 are lost workday cases resulting in 101,109 lost workdays, and 1,609 are non-lost workday cases.

On-the-Dock
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of FTE workers affected by the Marine Terminals standard, based on a 2,000 hour work-year, is 48,805. Applying
51 percent of the BLS injury rate to the 48,805 FTE workers on the dock yields 3,385 annual injuries occurring on the
dock. Of these, 1,294 are non-lost workday cases and 2,091 are lost workday cases resulting in 81,332 lost workdays.

Fatalities

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Although BLS did not provide a fatality rate for SIC 4491, data were available on the total of number of 1992 fatalities
that occurred in SIC 4491. BLS indicated that 13 fatalities occurred among SIC 4491 workers [1]. Since 54,617 FTE workers
(based on a 1,436 hour work-year) are estimated to be employed in SIC 4491, a fatality rate of 0.0238 per 100 FTE workers
(based on a 1,436 hour work-year) was derived.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
To determine the number of off-the-dock fatalities occurring annually, 49 percent of the fatality rate was applied
to the 87,951 FTE longshore workers (based on a 1,436 hour work-year). This results in 10 fatalities occurring, annually,
off the dock. On-the-Dock

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
To estimate the number of fatalities occurring among the population covered by the Marine Terminals standard, OSHA
used 51 percent of the fatality rate estimated above. As a result, approximately eight fatalities are estimated to
occur on the dock, annually.

BENEFITS
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards are expected to reduce many of the risks
involved in marine cargo handling operations. Reductions in fatalities and injuries are expected as a result of proposed
revisions to the two standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing OSHA's first reports of serious accidents in the marine cargo handling industry, Kearney/Centaur estimated
the percent of fatalities that would have been prevented by proposed revisions to the existing standards. Approximately
30 percent of off-the-dock fatalities and injuries could have been prevented through compliance with proposed requirements.
Thus, an estimated 3 fatalities are expected to be prevented, annually, by the proposed requirements. In addition,
an estimated 1,262 injuries would be prevented annually through compliance with proposed new requirements. Many
additional fatalities and injuries would be prevented through full compliance with existing requirements retained
in the proposed standards.

Summary of Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
All of the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards are likely to reduce the risk of injuries
occurring in the marine cargo handling industry. The proposed new requirements are expected to prevent approximately
3 of the 18 fatalities and 1,262 of the 7,593 injuries occurring annually among affected workers. Approximately 779
lost workday injuries involving 30,303 lost workdays are expected to be prevented, annually. An additional 483 non-lost
workday cases are also expected to be avoided. Many additional fatalities and injuries would likely be prevented
through full compliance with existing requirements retained in the proposed standards.

E. Economic Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compliance with the requirements of the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards are
not expected to produce any significant adverse economic impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs that are imposed by the regulation should be a minimal burden on all affected establishments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total annual revenues and profits associated with longshoring operations are approximately $7.8 billion and
$388.9 million, respectively [1]. The total estimated costs of compliance with the proposed revisions to the Longshoring
and Marine Terminals standards rules are less than $4.7 million for the first year after promulgation of the final
rules and less than $1.8 million annually, thereafter. Thus, the total first-year costs of compliance with the proposed
revisions represent less than 0.06 percent of the revenues and 1.19 percent of the profits of the industry. Compliance
costs for subsequent years represent less than 0.03 percent of revenues and less than 0.46 percent of profits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current practices in the marine cargo handling industry indicate that the requirements of the proposed standard
can generally be met without significant hardship. Many employers already comply with the proposed requirements
and presumably are not imposing substantial disadvantages on themselves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since stevedoring establishments engaging in similar cargo handling operations in the United States would be subject
to the same regulations, no competitive disadvantages between industries or with regard to international trade
are projected. Costs are expected to be passed through as an increase in the costs of cargo handling and shipping, and
the effect on profits and prices should be negligible. The estimated compliance costs would represent an average
increase in cost of less than 25 cents for shipping a loaded container in or out of U.S. ports, which costs an average
of about $3000. On the whole, the costs of marine cargo handling operations for society would actually decrease as
fewer accidents would mean less lost time and wages and fewer medical and legal resources necessary for a given amount
of cargo shipping and handling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated savings to society attributable to the prevention of injuries and fatalities would far outweigh the
costs of preventing these incidents. According to the National Safety Council, the total costs associated with occupational
injuries and deaths in 1992 were $115.9 billion, or an average cost of over $15,000 per case. This estimate includes
wage and productivity losses, medical costs, administrative expenses, and other costs associated with accidents.
The estimated benefits anticipated from proposed requirements include unquantifiable reductions in pain and suffering,
plus estimated savings of over $18 million annually.

REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (P.L. 96-353, 94 Stat. 1164 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)), OSHA has made an assessment of the impact of the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards,
and has concluded that they would not have a significant impact upon a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The important criterion that governs a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is whether the proposed standards would
impose significant costs upon small entities. ``Significance'' is determined by the effect upon profits, market
share, and the entity's financial viability. In particular, the effect of the proposed revisions upon small entities
relative to their effect upon large entities needs to be specifically evaluated. That is, OSHA must determine whether
the proposed requirements would have a relatively greater negative effect upon small entities than they would have
upon large entities, thereby putting small entities at a competitive disadvantage, and if so, whether there are ways
to minimize any differentially adverse effects without increasing the risk to employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the costs of compliance are proportional to firm size and are insignificant to small firms, then there is no significant
differential burden on small firms relative to that on large firms. In those cases involving large absolute costs
(typically capital equipment costs), financing may be more difficult to obtain for small entities than for larger
entities and in such cases of economies of scale in compliance, the burden on small firms will be greater than the burden
on large firms. The proposed changes to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards, however, require minimal
capital expenditures and generally impose costs that are proportional to firm size and the amount of business done.
In addition, these costs would be a minimal component of the overall costs of operations. As a result, small entities
would not be put at a competitive disadvantage to large entities due to these compliance costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, OSHA concluded that the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards would not have
a significant adverse impact upon a substantial number of small entities.

Impact Upon International Trade
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OSHA determined that compliance with the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards would
not have any measurable impact upon international trade. The compliance costs are minimal and are not expected to
affect exports, imports, or international competitiveness. To the extent that compliance with the proposed rule
would increase cargo handling efficiency and reduce the number of injuries and fatalities associated with these
operations, shipping costs may be reduced and result in a general increase in the competitiveness of U.S. firms.

IX. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards have been reviewed in accordance with the
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the regulations of
the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR Part 1500), and DOL NEPA Procedures (29 CFR Part 11). No significant
negative impact is foreseen on air, water or soil quality, plant or animal life, the use of land or sea, or other aspects
of the environment.

X. Recordkeeping Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 1320 of title 5 of the CFR sets forth procedures for agencies to follow in obtaining OMB clearance for information
collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed Longshoring standard requires the employer to allow OSHA access to records. In accordance with the provisions
of the Paperwork Reduction Act and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, OSHA certifies that it has submitted
the information collection to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of that Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average five minutes per response to allow
OSHA compliance officers access to the employer's records. Send comments regarding this burden estimate, or any
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Office of
Information Management, Department of Labor, Room N&hyph;1301, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20210; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Management and Budget, Washington, D.C. 20503.

XI. State Plan Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those of the 25 states with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans whose plans cover the issues
of maritime safety and health must revise their existing standard within six months of the publication date of the
final standard or show OSHA why there is no need for action, e.g., because an existing state standard covering this
area is already ``at least as effective'' as the revised Federal standard. Currently five states (California, Minnesota,
Oregon, Vermont and Washington) with their own state plans cover private sector on-shore maritime activities. Federal
OSHA enforces maritime standards offshore in all states and provides onshore coverage of maritime activities in
Federal OSHA states and in the following state Plan States: Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Virgin Islands, and Wyoming (all states
with state plans must also extend coverage to state and local government employees engaged in maritime activities.)

XII. Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standard has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987) regarding
Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting State policy options,
consult with States prior to taking any actions that would restrict State policy options, and take such actions only
when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides for
preemption of State law only if there is a clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national
scope. Additionally, the Order provides for preemption of State law only if there is a clear Congressional intent
for the agency to do so. Any such preemption is to be limited to the extent possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt State
laws relating to issues with respect to which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety or health standards.
Under the OSH Act a State can avoid preemption only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development
of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Plan-States
must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment
as the Federal standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal standards on longshoring and marine terminal operations address hazards which are not unique to any one
state or region of the country. Nonetheless, those States which have elected to participate under section 18 of the
OSHA Act would not be preempted by this final regulation and would be able to deal with special, local conditions within
the framework provided by this performance-oriented standard while ensuring that their standards are at least as
effective as the Federal standard.

Filing of Testimony and Evidence Before the Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any party requesting more than ten (10) minutes for presentation at the informal public hearing, or who intends to
submit documentary evidence, must provide in quadruplicate the testimony and evidence to be presented at the informal
public hearing. One copy shall not be stapled or bound and be suitable for copying. These materials must be provided

to the date of the hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each submission will be reviewed in light of the amount of time requested in the notice of intention to appear. In instances
where the information contained in the submission does not justify the amount of time requested, a more appropriate
amount of time will be allocated and the participant will be notified of that fact prior to the informal hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any party who has not substantially complied with the above requirement may be limited to a ten-minute presentation
and may be requested to return for questioning at a later time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any party who has not filed a notice of intention to appear may be allowed to testify for no more than 10 minutes as time
permits, at the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, but will not be allowed to question witnesses.

Conduct and Nature of Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The hearing will commence at 9:30 a.m. on the first day. At that time, any procedural matters relating to the proceeding
will be resolved. The nature of an informal rulemaking hearing is established in the legislative history of section
6 of the OSH Act and is reflected by OSHA's rules of procedure for hearings (29 CFR 1911.15(a)). Although the presiding
officer is an Administrative Law Judge and questioning by interested persons is allowed on crucial issues, the proceeding
is informal and legislative in type. The Agency's intent, in essence, is to provide interested persons with an opportunity
to make effective oral presentations which can proceed expeditiously in the absence of procedural restraints which
impede or protract the rulemaking process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, since the hearing is primarily for information gathering and clarification, it is an informal administrative
proceeding rather than an adjudicative one. The technical rules of evidence, for example do not apply. The regulations
that govern hearings and the pre-hearing guidelines to be issued for this hearing will ensure fairness and due process
and also facilitate the development of a clear, accurate and complete record. Those rules and guidelines will be interpreted
in a manner that furthers that development. Thus, questions of relevance, procedure and participation generally
will be decided so as to favor development of the record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing will be conducted in accordance with 29 CFR part 1911. It should be noted that 1911.4 specifies the Assistant
Secretary may upon reasonable notice issue alternative procedures to expedite proceedings or for other good cause.
The hearing will be presided over by an Administrative Law Judge who makes no decision or recommendation on the merits
of OSHA's proposal. The responsibility of the Administrative Law Judge is to ensure that the hearing proceeds at a
reasonable pace and in an orderly manner. The Administrative Law Judge, therefore, will have all the powers necessary
and appropriate to conduct a full and fair informal hearing as provided in 29 CFR part 1911 including the powers:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. To regulate the course of the proceedings;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To dispose of procedural requests, objections and comparable matters;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. To confine the presentations to the matters pertinent to the issues raised;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. To regulate the conduct of those present at the hearing by appropriate means;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In the Judge's discretion, to question and permit the questioning of any witnesses and to limit the time for questioning;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In the Judge's discretion, to keep the record open for a reasonable, stated time (known as the post-hearing comment
period) to receive written information and additional data, views and arguments from any person who has participated
in the oral proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA recognizes that there may be interested persons or organizations who, through their knowledge of the subject
matter or their experience in the field, would wish to endorse or support the whole proposal or certain provisions
of the proposal. OSHA welcomes such supportive comments, including any pertinent data and cost information which
may be available, in order that the record of this rulemaking will present a balanced picture of public response on
the issues involved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whenever practicable, a gangway of not less than 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inches (.51 m) in width, of adequate strength, maintained in safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repair and safely secured shall be used. If a gangway is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practicable, a substantial straight ladder meeting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;1918.25 of this subpart and extending at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36 inches (.92 m) above the upper landing surface, and adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secured against shifting or slipping shall be provided. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions are such that neither a gangway nor straight ladder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be used, a Jacob's ladder meeting the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1918.22 may be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each side of such gangway, and the turntable, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used, shall have a railing with a minimum height of 33 inches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(.84 m) measured perpendicularly from rail to walking surfaces at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stanchion, with a midrail. Rails shall be of wood, pipe, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain, wire, rope or materials of equivalent strength and shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be kept taut at all times. Portable stanchions supporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
railings shall be so supported or secured as to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidental dislodgement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The gangway shall be kept properly trimmed at all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When a fixed flat tread accommodation ladder is used, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the angle is low enough to require employees to walk on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
edge of the treads, cleated duckboards shall be laid over and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secured to the ladder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When the gangway overhangs the water in such a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that there is danger of employees falling between the ship and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the dock, a net or suitable protection shall be provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent employees from falling to a lower level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the foot of the gangway is more than 1 foot (.30 m) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
away from the edge of the apron, the space between them shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bridged by a firm walkway equipped with railings with a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
height of approximately 33 inches (.84 m) with midrails on both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Gangways shall be kept clear of supporting bridles and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other obstructions, in order to provide unobstructed passage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, because of design, the gangway bridle cannot be moved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to provide unobstructed passage, than the hazard shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly marked to alert employees of the danger. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When the upper end of the means of access rests on or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is flush with the top of the bulwark, substantial steps, properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secured, trimmed and equipped with at least one substantial hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rail 33 inches (.84 m) in height shall be provided between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
top of the bulwark and the deck. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Obstructions shall not be laid on or across the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gangway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Handrails and walking surfaces of gangways shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kept free of oil, grease, bulk cargoes or other substances that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could cause an employee to slip and fall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) The means of access shall be illuminated for its full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length in accordance with &sect;1918.92. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) If possible, the vessel's means of access shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located so that suspended loads do not pass over it. In any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
event, suspended loads shall not be passed over the means of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access while employees or others are on it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) There shall be at least one safe and accessible ladder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each gang working in a hatch. However, no more than two such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ladders are required in any hatch. An effective means of gaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a handhold shall be provided at or near the head of each vertical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fixed ladder cannot serve this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When any fixed ladder is visibly unsafe, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer shall identify such ladder and prohibit its use by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Where portable straight ladders are used, they shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of sufficient length to extend 36 inches (.91 m) above the upper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landing surface, and positively secured or held against shifting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or slipping. When conditions are such that a straight ladder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be used, Jacob's ladders meeting the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1918.22 may be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When 6 inches (15.2 cm) or more of clearance does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist in back of ladder rungs, the ladder shall be deemed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``unsafe'' for the purpose of this section. However, for vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built prior to December 5, 1981, the ladder shall be deemed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``unsafe'' when 4 inches (10 cm) or more of clearance does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist in back of ladder rungs. Alternate means of access (for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, a portable ladder) must be utilized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) (1) Where access to or from a stowed deckload or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cargo is needed and no other safe means is available, ladders or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps of adequate strength shall be furnished, and positively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secured or held against shifting or slipping while in use. Steps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formed by the cargo itself are acceptable when the employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates that the nature of the cargo and the type of stowage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides equivalent safe access. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where portable straight ladders are used they shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of sufficient length to extend at least 36 inches (.92 m) above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the upper landing surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The following standards for existing manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portable ladders must be met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Rungs of manufactured portable ladders obtained before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Rungs shall be evenly spaced from 9 to 161/2 inches (22.9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 41.9 cm), center to center. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Rungs shall be continuous members between rails. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rung of a double-rung ladder (two side rails and a center rail) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall extend the full width of the ladder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Width between side rails at the base of the ladder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Handling hatch beams and covers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (f)(2), (g), and (h) of this section apply only to folding, sliding, or hinged metal hatch covers or to those
hatch covers handled by cranes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) (1) When hatch covers or pontoons are stowed on the weather deck abreast of hatches, they shall be arranged in stable
piles not closer than 3 feet (.91 m) from the hatch coaming except, when on the working side of the hatch, they are spread
one high between coaming and bulwark with no space between them and with not less than a 24-inch height of hatch coaming
maintained. Under no circumstances shall hatch covers or pontoons be stacked higher than the hatch coaming or bulwark
on the working side of the hatch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On seagoing vessels, hatch boards or similar covers removed from the hatch beams in a section of partially opened
hatch during cargo handling, cleaning or other operations, shall not be stowed on those left in place within that section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Hatch beams shall be laid on their sides, or stood on edge close together and lashed. Except that: This paragraph
(b) shall not apply in cases where hatch beams are of such design that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The width of the flange is 50 percent or more of the height of the web; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The flange rests flat on the deck when the hatch beam is stood upright. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Strongbacks, hatch covers, and pontoons removed from hatch openings and placed on the weather deck shall not obstruct
clear fore and aft or coaming to bulwark passageways and shall be lashed or otherwise secured to prevent accidental
dislodgement. Dunnage or other suitable material shall be placed under each tier, to prevent strongbacks and hatch
covers from sliding, when stowed on steel decks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Hatch covers unshipped in an intermediate deck shall be placed at least 3 feet (.91 m) from the coaming or they shall
be removed to another deck. Strongbacks unshipped in an intermediate deck shall not be placed closer than 6 inches
(15.2 cm) from the coaming, and if placed closer than 3 feet (.91 m), they shall be secured so that they cannot be tipped
or dragged into a lower compartment. If such placement or securement is not possible, strongbacks shall be removed
to another deck. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Any hatch beam or pontoon left in place adjacent to an open hatch section being worked shall be locked or otherwise
secured, so that it cannot be accidently displaced. All portable, manually handled hatch covers, including those
bound together to make a larger cover, shall be removed from any working section, and adjacent sections, unless securely
lashed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) (1) The roller hatch beam at the edge of the open section of the hatch shall be lashed or pinned back so that it cannot
be moved toward the open section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Rolling, sectional or telescopic hatch covers of barges which open in a fore and aft direction shall be secured
while in the open position against unintentional movement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Hinged or folding hatch covers normally stowed in an approximately vertical position shall be positively secured
when in the upright position, unless the design of the system otherwise prohibits unintentional movement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Hatches shall not be opened or closed while employees are in the square of the hatch below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) All unsecured materials such as dunnage, lashings, twist-locks, or stacking cones shall be removed from the hatch
cover before the hatch cover is moved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) When a hatch is to be covered, hatch covers or night tents shall be used. Any covering which only partially covers
the hatch, such as alternate hatch covers or strips of dunnage, shall not be covered by a tarpaulin. Except that: A tarpaulin
may be used to cover an open or partially open hatch in order to reduce dust emissions during bulk cargo loading operations,
provided that employees are prevented from walking on top of the tarpaulin.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) When preventers are used they shall be of sufficient strength for the intended purpose and secured to the head of
the boom independent of working guys except when, in the case of cast fittings, the strength of the fitting exceeds
the total strength of all lines secured to it. Any tails, fittings, or other means of making the preventers fast on deck
shall provide strength equal to that of the preventer itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Wire rope clips or knots shall not be used to form eyes in, nor to join sections of, preventer guys.

 (1) When an employee works in the bight formed by the heel block, a preventer of at least three quarter inch (1.9 cm) diameter
wire rope shall be securely rigged, or equally effective means shall be taken, to hold the block and fall in the event
that the heel block attachments fail. Where physical limitations prohibit the fitting of a wire rope preventer of
the required size, two turns of one-half inch (1.3 cm) diameter wire rope shall be sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the heel block is not so rigged as to prevent its falling when not under strain, it shall be secured to prevent alternate

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Except as noted in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, fork lift trucks shall be equipped with overhead guards securely
attached to the machines. The guard shall be of such design and construction as to protect the operator from boxes,
cartons, packages, bagged material, and other similar individual items of cargo which may fall from the load being
handled or from stowage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Overhead guards shall not obstruct the operator's view, and openings in the top of the guard shall not exceed 6 inches
(15.2 cm) in one of the two directions, width or length. Larger openings are permitted if no opening allows the smallest
unit of cargo being handled through the guard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Overhead guards shall be built so that failure of the vehicle's mast tilting mechanism will not displace the guard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Overhead guards shall be large enough to extend over the operator during all truck operations, including forward
tilt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) An overhead guard may be removed only when it would prevent a truck from entering a work space and if the operator
is not exposed to low overhead obstructions in the work space. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Where necessary to protect the operator, fork lift trucks shall be fitted with a vertical load backrest extension
to prevent the load from hitting the mast when the mast is positioned at maximum backward tilt. For this purpose, a ``load
backrest extension'' means a device extending vertically from the fork carriage frame to prevent raised loads from
falling backward.

design and construction as to protect the operator, when seated, against injury from contact with a projecting overhead.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Guards and their attachment points shall be so designed as to be able to withstand, without excessive deflection,
a load applied horizontally at the operator's shoulder level equal to the drawbar pull of the machine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Guards shall not be required when the vehicle is used in situations in which the possibility of the seated operator
coming in contact with projecting overheads does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

top layer of which is not bound by the sling, shall be slung in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a manner as to prevent sliders. Double slings shall be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on unstrapped dunnage, except when, due to the size of hatch or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deep tank openings, it is impractical to use them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Case hooks shall be used only with cases designed to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hoisted by these hooks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Bales of cotton, wool, cork, wood pulp, gunny bags or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar articles shall be hoisted only by straps strong enough to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support the weight of the bale. At least two hooks, each in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate strap, shall be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Unitized loads bound by bands or straps may be hoisted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the banding or strapping only if the banding or strapping is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable for hoisting and is strong enough to support the weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the load. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Additional means of hoisting shall be employed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure safe lifting of unitized loads having damaged banding or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strapping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Loads requiring continuous manual guidance during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling shall be guided by guide ropes (tag lines) that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long enough to control the load. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) No draft shall be hoisted unless the winch or crane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator(s) can clearly see the draft itself or see the signals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a signalman in observation of the draft's movement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Intermodal containers shall be handled in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with &sect;1918.85.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No container shall be hoisted by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lifting appliance unless the following conditions have been met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The employer shall ascertain from the carrier whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container to be hoisted is loaded or empty. Empty containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be identified before loading or discharge in such a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as will inform every supervisor and foreman on the site and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charge of loading or discharging, or every crane or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hoisting equipment operator and signalman, if any, that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container is empty. Methods of identification may include cargo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans, manifests, or markings on the container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of a loaded container: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The actual gross weight shall be plainly marked so as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be visible to the crane or other hoisting equipment operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or signalman, or to every supervisor or foreman on site and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charge of the operation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The cargo stowage plan or equivalent permanently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recorded display serving the same purpose, containing the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gross weight and the serial number or other positive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of that specific container, shall be provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the crane or other hoisting equipment operator and signalman, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any, and to every supervisor and foreman on site and in charge of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Every outbound container which is received at a marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminal ready to load aboard a vessel without further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consolidation or loading shall be weighed to obtain the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gross weight, either at the terminal or elsewhere, before being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hoisted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) (i) When container weighing scales are located at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine terminal, any outbound container with a load consolidated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at that terminal shall be weighed to obtain the actual weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before being hoisted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the terminal has no scales, the actual gross weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be calculated on the basis of the container's contents and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the container's empty weight. The weights used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation shall be posted conspicuously on the container, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the name of the person making the calculation, and the date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Open top vehicle carrying containers, and those built 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically and used solely for the carriage of compressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gases, are excepted from paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Closed dry van containers carrying vehicles are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempted from paragraph (b)(4) of this section provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The container carries only completely assembled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles and no other cargo; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The container is marked on the outside in such a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an employee can readily discern that the container is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carrying vehicles; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The vehicles were loaded into the container at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine terminal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The weight of loaded inbound containers from foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ports shall be determined by weighing, by the method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by shipping documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Any scale used within the United States to weigh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers for the purpose of the requirements of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall meet the accuracy standards of the state or local public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority in which the scale is located.

Ventilation with respect to carbon monoxide.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1)(i) When internal combustion engines exhaust into a hold, intermediate deck, or any other compartment, the employer
shall see that tests of the carbon monoxide content of the atmosphere are made with such frequency to ensure that dangerous
concentrations do not exceed allowable limits. Such tests shall be made in the area in which employees are working
by persons competent in the use of the test equipment and procedures. If operations are located in a deep tank or refrigerated
compartment, the first test shall be made within one half hour of the time the engine starts. In order to determine the
need for further testing, the initial test in all other cargo handling areas shall be taken no later than one hour after
the time the engine starts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The carbon monoxide content of the atmosphere in a compartment, hold, or any enclosed space shall be maintained
at not more than 35 parts per million (ppm) (0.0035%) as an 8-hour time weighted average and employees shall be removed
from the enclosed space if the carbon monoxide concentration exceeds 100 ppm (0.01%). The short term exposure limit
in outdoors, non-enclosed spaces shall be 200 ppm (0.02%) measured over a 5 minute period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
time weighted average
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means that for any period of time in which the concentration exceeds 35 parts per million, it shall be maintained at
a corresponding amount below 35 parts per million for an equal period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(iii) When both natural ventilation and the vessel's ventilation system are inadequate to keep the carbon monoxide
concentration within the allowable limits, the employer shall use supplementary means to bring such concentration
within allowable limits, as determined by actual monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A record of the date, time, location and results of the tests required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall
be maintained for at least 30 days after the work has been completed. Such records may be entered on any retrievable
medium, and shall be available for inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The intakes of portable blowers and any exposed belt drives shall be guarded to prevent injury to employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The frames of portable blowers shall be grounded at the source of the current by means of an equipment grounding
conductor run with or enclosing the circuit conductors. When the vessel is the source of the current, the equipment
grounding conductor shall be bonded to the structure of the vessel. Electric cords used shall be free from visible
defects.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fumigated grains.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Before commencing to handle bulk grain in any compartment of a vessel in which employees will or may be present,
the employer shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) ascertain from the elevator operator whether the grain has been or will be fumigated at the elevator; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) ascertain from the vessel's officers, agent, or other knowledgeable source whether those compartments, or
any cargo within them that was loaded at a prior berth, have been treated with a fumigant or any other chemical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If such treatment has been carried out, or if there is reason to suspect that such treatment has been carried out,
it shall be determined by atmospheric testing that the compartment's atmosphere is within allowable limits. (See
paragraph (b)(3) of this section.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A test of the fumigant concentration in the atmosphere of the compartment shall be made after loading begins and
before employees enter the compartment. Additional tests shall be made as often as necessary to ensure that hazardous
concentrations do not develop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Tests for fumigant concentration shall be conducted by a designated person, who shall be thoroughly familiar
with the characteristics of the fumigant being used, the correct procedure for measurement, the proper measuring
equipment to be used, the manufacturer's recommendations and warnings, and the proper use of personal protective
equipment employed to guard against the specific hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A record of the date, time, location and results of the tests required by paragraph (b) of this section shall be
maintained for at least 30 days after the work has been completed. Such records may be entered on any retrievable medium,
and shall be available for inspection.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) At any time the concentration in any compartment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaches the level specified as hazardous by the fumigant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer or by part 1910, subpart Z of this chapter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever is lower, all employees shall be removed from such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compartments and shall not be permitted to re-enter until such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time as tests demonstrate that the atmosphere is within allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) No employee shall be permitted to enter any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compartment in which grain fumigation has been carried out, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any compartment immediately adjacent to such a compartment, until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it has been determined by test that the atmosphere in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compartment to be entered is within allowable limits for entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) In the event a compartment containing a hazardous or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unknown concentration of fumigants must be entered for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of testing the atmosphere, or for emergency purposes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each employee entering shall be protected by respiratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective equipment recommended by the fumigant manufacturer for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection against the particular hazards. At least two other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees shall be stationed outside the compartment as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observers, to provide rescue services in the event of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency. The observers shall be equipped with similar personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) One or more employees on duty shall be equipped and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

handled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In the event that a compartment is treated for local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infestation before loading grain by a chemical other than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fumigant, the employee applying the treatment, and any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees entering the compartment, shall be provided with and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to use any personal protective equipment which may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended by the manufacturer of the product to protect them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against the effects of exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Every lifting appliance shall be tested with a test load which shall exceed the Safe Working Load (SWL) as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->
Up to 20 tons 
<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
25 percent in excess. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 to 50 tons 
<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
5 tons in excess. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over 50 tons 
<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
10 percent in excess. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</TABLE>

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. In the case of derrick systems, the test load shall be lifted with the ship's normal tackle with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derrick at the minimum angle to the horizontal for which the derrick system was designed (generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15 degrees), or at such greater angle as may be agreed. The angle at which the test was made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be stated in the certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.1. The SWL shown is applicable to swinging derrick systems only. When derricks are used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
union purchase, the SWL (U) is to be shown on Form 2 (U). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.2. In the case of heavy derricks, care should be taken to ensure that the appropriate stays are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correctly rigged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In the case of cranes, the test load is to be hoisted, slewed and luffed at slow speed. Gantry and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traveling cranes together with their trolleys, where appropriate, are to be traversed and travelled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the full length of their track. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.1. In the case of variable load-radius cranes, the tests are generally to be carried out with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate test load at maximum, minimum and intermediate radii. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.2. In the case of hydraulic cranes where limitations of pressure make it impossible to lift a test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
load 25 percent in excess of the safe working load, it will be sufficient to lift the greatest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible load, but in general this should not be less than 10 percent in excess of the safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working load. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. As a general rule, tests should carried out using test loads, and no exception should be allowed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case of initial tests. In the case of repairs/replacement or when the periodic examination calls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for re-test, consideration may be given to the use of spring or hydraulic balances provided the SWL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the lifting appliance does not exceed 15 tones. Where a spring or hydraulic balance is used, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be calibrated and accurate to within 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2 percent and the indicator should remain constant for 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.1. If the test weights are not used, this is to be indicated in Col. (3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The expression ``tone'' shall mean a tone of 1000 kg. (2000 lbs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The terms ``competent person'', ``thorough examination'', and ``lifting appliance'' are defined in Form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note: For recommendations on test procedures reference may be made to the ILO document ``Safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health in Dock Work''.

This Appendix is non-mandatory and provides guidance to part 1918 to assist employers and employees in complying

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the almost limitless physical possibilities dictated by such factors as vessel design; container type; container
stowage; types of container hoisting gear, etc., there may be instances during vessel loading/discharge operations
when it is not feasible to utilize container top fall protection devices. As a result, a case by case and event by event
approach must be utilized in assessing the feasibility of providing such devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following are examples of situations where fall protection 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
may
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 not be feasible: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When hooking up to or disconnecting from an overheight container using ``special'' gear, where attaching
fall protection to the cranes spreader bar is not allowed by the owner of the crane (for example a Port Authority). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When handling containers, ``in a chimney stow'' on a break bulk vessel, with ships gear, when a personnel basket
is not sufficient to be used as an anchorage point.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today proposes to amend its regulations under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA) governing the permitting of hazardous waste management facilities. This proposed rule expands
the opportunities for public involvement by allowing public participation at an earlier point in the permitting
process for all RCRA facilities, and during key permitting milestones. This proposed rule also amends and clarifies
permit modification classifications pertaining to combustion facilities. Finally, this proposed rule amends
the procedures for interim status combustion facilities during the trial burn period by making the procedures more
equivalent to the procedures governing permitted facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations are proposed under the authority of sections 2002, 3004, 3005 and 7004(b) of the Solid Waste Disposal
Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments
of 1984.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), requires owners and operators of treatment, storage,
and disposal facilities to comply with standards ``necessary to protect human health and the environment.'' These
standards are implemented generally through interim status standards applicable to facilities that achieve interim
status under RCRA section 3005(c), and through permits that are issued by EPA or under authorized State programs.
EPA continuously strives to improve the hazardous waste management standards in order to ensure protection of human
health and the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The role that combustion plays in hazardous waste management has changed dramatically over the last decade and a half.
With the recognition that land disposal of hazardous waste could present long term pollution problems, larger use
of combustion ensued. However, waste treatment alone will not totally solve the problems associated with hazardous
waste disposal. Therefore, EPA decided to take a fresh look at how to achieve a fully integrated waste management program
that gives source reduction its proper emphasis.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 While the Agency is committed to source reduction as its primary approach to waste management, it believes that there
will continue to be a role for waste combustion, provided it is done safely and in compliance with federal regulations.
Combustion is a proven waste treatment technique to address many types of wastes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To this end, on May 18, 1993, the Agency announced its Draft Strategy on Waste Minimization and Hazardous Waste Combustion.
EPA issued the strategy in draft form as the starting point for the debate on what source reduction/recycling actions
and regulatory changes the Agency should pursue. The Agency has been aggressive in involving all the stakeholders
as part of the national dialogue on these national policy questions. In addition, since EPA and the States are partners
and co-regulators in hazardous waste management, any evaluation of the role of waste minimization and hazardous
waste combustion in the hazardous waste management system must be a joint federal and state effort. Thus, EPA and the
States have used, and will continue to use, a joint EPA/State committee to further develop the national strategy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the context of a national dialogue on waste minimization and hazardous waste combustion, the Agency has identified
a number of specific actions it would pursue to ensure that existing combustion facilities operate safely and without
unacceptable risks to human health and the environment. These actions include:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Aggressive use of waste minimization measures in permitting and enforcement efforts that involve generators
of combustible waste, as well as incinerators and boilers and industrial furnaces (BIFs);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensuring that a comprehensive risk assessment, including indirect risk, is conducted at each facility site;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Use of omnibus permitting authority to include dioxin/furan emission limits and more stringent particulate
matter standards in new permits, where necessary to protect human health and the environment; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Giving low management priority to permitting any new incinerator and BIF capacity, unless the new facilities
would replace and be a significant improvement over existing capacity; in other words, the draft strategy makes interim
status combustion facilities the highest permitting priority, in terms of processing permits, in order to bring
these facilities under more comprehensive environmental controls.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the draft strategy calls for development of mechanisms to facilitate increased public participation
in the permitting process. By developing such mechanisms, EPA hopes to allow the public early access to information
about the facility and an opportunity to participate in permitting decisions regarding hazardous waste storage,
treatment, or disposal facilities (TSDFs) that may affect their communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By providing citizens an enhanced opportunity to participate in facility permitting, the Agency is striving to give
citizens more input into decisions about facilities that may impact their communities. This may be particularly
so in low income or minority communities where the lack of this opportunity has been felt strongly. Consistent with
the Agency's efforts to ensure environmental justice, EPA intends that this rulemaking will give people in such communities
increased opportunity to affect RCRA permitting decisions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft strategy has many components and implementing all of its aspects will take time. Today's notice is the first
regulatory action that EPA has taken under the draft strategy; it addresses public participation and several improvements
to the RCRA permitting program that EPA had envisioned prior to the development of the draft strategy. Specifically,
EPA proposes to: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Expand opportunities for timely and effective public involvement in the permitting process for all types of units;
(2) improve the regulations pertaining to permit modifications, specifically, to clarify combustion modification
classifications; and (3) align certain interim status requirements for combustion units with the more stringent
permit standards for new units, particularly with regard to trial burns. Although the Draft Waste Minimization and
Combustion Strategy focuses on combustion units, many of the requirements EPA is proposing today are more encompassing
and apply to all RCRA facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional efforts are underway to continue to improve EPA's hazardous waste management standards and to implement
other components of the Agency's Draft Waste Minimization and Combustion Strategy. Today's proposed rule is only
one piece of an integrated and comprehensive set of regulatory, non-regulatory, and guidance materials intended
to support the Agency's Draft Waste Minimization and Combustion Strategy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has taken administrative steps to address the section of the draft strategy that discusses the Agency's permit
denial and appeals process. In particular, the draft strategy indicates that EPA will evaluate ways to limit the burning
of hazardous waste in interim status units during the administrative appeal of a permit denial, prior to a final decision.
EPA considered a number of options for implementing this aspect of the draft strategy and selected one that could be
effected immediately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency issued a directive under Administrator Browner's signature, on March 16, 1994, to prioritize and expedite
the review by the Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) of Federal RCRA permit denials. Under the procedures set forth
in the directive, entitled Expedited Administrative Review of Appeals of RCRA Permit Denials Filed by Interim Status
Hazardous Waste Combustion Facilities, the Administrator directed the EAB to take final action on any combustion
permit denial no later than 90 days from the receipt of a petition for review. EPA believes that these procedures will
promote the draft strategy's goal of limiting burning of waste during the potentially lengthy appeals process, during
which interim status facilities whose permits were denied were entitled to continue operating under interim status,
without infringing upon important rights of appeal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Expanded Public Participation Requirements for All RCRA Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose of Public Involvement in Today's Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this section of the proposed rule is to enhance public involvement in the RCRA permit process by improving
and increasing the opportunities for public participation. The permitting agency should carry out these new opportunities
concurrently with the existing permitting process. Today's proposed requirements should not delay the process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Public participation'' is part of the process leading to a final EPA or State permit decision; it provides an opportunity
for the public to express its views to the permitting authority and the applicant, and enables both to give due consideration
to the public's concerns. Today's proposal will establish procedures to promote better and more timely information-sharing,
not only between the public and the permitting agency, but among the facility applicant, EPA (or the State) and the
public. In particular, the rule places new responsibilities on the permit applicant. The Agency believes that the
permit applicant, who is responsible for initiating the permit process, is a key participant in the public participation
process because it is the permit applicant who must interact and operate within the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this portion of today's proposal applies to all applicants for new RCRA permits, certain aspects of the proposal
specifically respond to the Agency's Draft Waste Minimization and Combustion Strategy (see the Background Section
of today's preamble for further discussion of the draft strategy). As noted above, one component of the draft strategy
specifically calls for greater and earlier public involvement in the hazardous waste permitting process. Accordingly,
EPA proposes to amend the hazardous waste regulations to provide for earlier public involvement in the permitting
process and, in the case of combustion units, to ensure public involvement at the trial burn plan stage. For example,
today's regulations propose specific provisions to: solicit public participation at the beginning of the permit
process for all new and interim status facilities; maintain open lines of communication with the public throughout
the permit process; and increase public involvement with regard to trial burn plans at combustion facilities. These
provisions will provide the public an expanded role in the permitting process by promoting community participation
and input at all decision-making levels. These provisions will also help the permitting authority to better address
public concerns during the permitting process and foster continued community involvement after facilities are
permitted. These procedures are consistent with, and in furtherance of, the congressional mandate, expressed in
RCRA section 7004(b)(1), to ``encourage'' and ``assist'' public involvement in implementation of the permit program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Current Public Participation Requirements in the RCRA Permit Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed public involvement requirements build upon the current RCRA public participation process. EPA
does not intend for the proposed provisions to replace or delete the existing public participation requirements
in 40 CFR part 124 and 40 CFR 270.42; these requirements form the foundation for public involvement activities during
the RCRA permitting process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four steps make up the existing RCRA permitting decision process: (1) Receipt and review of the permit application;
(2) preparation of draft permit or decision to deny; (3) public comment period; and (4) final permit decision. EPA
regulations currently require public involvement activities during two of the four steps. The first step in the decision
process begins when the permitting agency receives the permit application from the facility. Under the existing
federal rules, no direct public involvement activities occur at this stage; however, the permitting agency begins
to assemble a mailing list of appropriate government agencies and individuals, including interested members of
the public, as required by &sect;124.10(c). The permitting agency uses the list to distribute information about
meetings, hearings, and available reports and documents later in the permit process. In addition, the permitting
agency may periodically publicize the existence of this list and solicit additions to it.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second step in the permitting decision process occurs after the regulatory agency completes review of the permit
application. At this point, the regulatory agency decides either to tentatively deny the permit application or to
prepare a draft permit for the facility. The third step occurs once the regulatory agency makes its preliminary decision
about the permit application. Under the existing regulations, the public has its first formal participation opportunities
in this step. If the permitting agency prepares a draft permit, it must give a formal public notice that the draft permit
is available for public review and comment. In addition, the permitting authority must formally notify the public
if it plans to deny a permit application. In both cases, the permitting agency must place the notice in a major local
newspaper, broadcast it over local radio stations, and send it to all persons on the mailing list. A 45-day public comment
period on the draft permit or notice of intent to deny the permit follows the publication of the notice. The comment
period provides the public with an opportunity to comment, in writing, on conditions contained in the draft permit
or notice of intent to deny. The regulatory agency may re-open or extend the comment period if, during the comment period,
it receives substantial new questions or issues concerning the draft permit decision. In addition, the public may
request that the permitting agency hold a public hearing on the draft permit decision. If the regulatory agency holds
a public hearing, it must give the public a 30-day advance notice of the time and place of the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final permit decision is the fourth step in the permitting decision process. After the public comment period closes,
the regulatory agency reviews and evaluates all written and oral comments and, then, issues a final permit decision.
At this time, the regulatory agency must send a notice of decision, together with a written response to all significant
comments, to all persons who submitted public comments or requested notice of the final permit decision (in accordance
with &sect;124.17). The response to comments summarizes all significant comments received during the public comment
period and explains how the permitting authority addressed or rejected the comments in the final permit decision.
The permitting agency must place the written response to comments in the Administrative Record established at the
regulatory agency.

3. Summary of Proposed Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. EPA's approach to public participation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's amendments introduce provisions for new public notices and meetings in the permit process. Through this
approach, EPA intends to open opportunities for public participation earlier in the permit process. Through earlier
public involvement and improved public awareness, today's requirements will result in more meaningful and interactive
public participation. At the same time, these amendments are flexible and allow permitting agencies and facilities
to tailor public participation activities according to facility-specific circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By expanding public involvement opportunities, the proposed rule should streamline the permitting process, since
public issues will be raised and addressed earlier in the process. At present, formal public involvement in the permitting
process does not begin until the draft permit stage. By this point in the process, the permitting authority and the
applicant already have discussed crucial parts of the Part B application; thus, the public often feels that most major
decisions on the permit are made before public input. Under today's proposed requirements, the permitting authority
will be focusing discussion and dialogue on the permit application earlier in the permitting process. EPA wishes
to encourage the public to participate in these earlier and expanded opportunities for involvement, fully raising
issues and concerns early so they may be evaluated and responded to. Such early and meaningful dialogue should result
in an expeditious permit decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The earlier public involvement opportunities proposed today allow the public the opportunity to raise issues before
many decisions are made. This then allows the applicant and the permitting authority to address citizen concerns.
The idea of promoting earlier public involvement in the permitting process is also consistent with recommendations
put forth by the RCRA Implementation Study and a number of outside sources (e.g., the Keystone Center, environmental
groups, and business trade associations). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered a variety of approaches in developing today's proposal. After careful evaluation, EPA believes that
the proposed requirements will meet the Agency's goal of providing increased opportunity for public involvement.
Today's proposed requirements would not, of course, preclude additional public involvement activities beyond
the regulations, where appropriate on a facility-specific basis, such as alternative public outreach activities,
supplementary meetings, or fact sheets. At RCRA locations, in fact, permitting agencies and facilities have implemented
a variety of public involvement activities that have helped affected communities to understand and participate
in permit decision-making. EPA has published a practical how-to guidance for regional permit writers and public
involvement staff, entitled the RCRA Public Involvement Manual (September 1993/ EPA 530&hyph;R&hyph;93&hyph;006).
In the guidance, EPA recommends public involvement activities to encourage productive public participation in
a variety of community and facility situations. Additional examples of ways to expand public involvement, beyond
what is required by today's proposed regulations, are included in section 5.a: General Requirements for Providing
Public Notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before drafting this proposal, the Agency contacted a variety of interested parties involved in public outreach
activities. EPA had discussions with a range of groups, including: Public interest groups, industry, state and local
government, Indian tribal representatives, trade associations, and public involvement specialists from EPA regions
and Headquarters. These groups submitted valuable comments and suggestions to the Agency on how to expand and enhance
public involvement. The Agency also held an informal meeting on October 13, 1993, with a small, yet diverse group of
stakeholders to receive their input and to facilitate the exchange of information concerning greater opportunities
for public participation. This meeting was a starting point for efforts to improve public involvement in the permitting
process; EPA would like to continue these discussions beyond this proposal.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rule is consistent with, and builds upon, the Agency's final Public Participation Policy, published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 46 FR 5740, January 19, 1981. This policy established a uniform set of guidelines concerning public participation
in all EPA programs. The guidelines encouraged EPA programs to provide a consistent level of public involvement during
EPA activities, including State and local activities funded or delegated by EPA. The 1981 policy embodied many public
comments on improving the process and outlined new steps that the Agency should take to ensure that members of the public
are given earlier and better opportunities to be involved in EPA decision-making. Among other things, the policy
emphasized public access to information as a critical component to successful public participation programs, and
encouraged the use of a variety of outreach activities throughout the permit process so that the public can be kept
up to date on matters of concern. Today's rule builds upon these policy statements and, in many cases, strengthens
them through proposed regulatory language. For example, EPA is proposing regulatory requirements to provide the
public with the opportunity to attend a public meeting at the outset of the permitting process. Additional public
notices, including improved notification activities, are required at new points within the permit process. These
proposed notices will provide information to the public at the beginning of decision-making processes so that the
public will have adequate time to respond. Finally, today's rule adopts the ideas suggested by the policy on ``depositories''
and incorporates them into a flexible tool called the information ``repository.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a separate effort, the Agency is reviewing its regulations that impose restrictions on siting RCRA hazardous waste
treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs). The Agency's current regulations impose restrictions on
siting these facilities in flood plains and seismic zones. EPA believes that there may be a need for enhanced national
minimum standards as required under section 3004(o)(7) of RCRA. Consistent with Executive Order 12898 on environmental
justice, EPA is reviewing existing and potential standards for siting hazardous waste TSDFs. As a part of this review,
the Agency intends to look at siting TSDFs in proximity to populations and institutions such as schools, hospitals,
and prisons, to determine whether there is a need to consider (and the appropriate way to do so) such factors in siting
these facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conducting the review, EPA will recognize the appropriate role of State and local governments in land use planning
and facility siting. EPA does not intend to preempt this role. Rather, it is EPA's intention to review the current procedures
and requirements to identify whether any additional measures are necessary to protect human health and the environment.

b. Structure of proposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In expanding the public involvement activities within the permit process, EPA proposes to place these requirements
within 40 CFR parts 124 and 270. EPA placed the general requirements for public participation within Part 124 Subpart
B_Specific Procedures Applicable to RCRA Permits. Subpart B is an already established section, which does not contain
any regulations at this time. EPA proposes to place public involvement requirements within Subpart B to ensure a clear
and orderly integration of new RCRA permitting requirements into part 124. Please note that other sections of this
rule will address additional public involvement requirements during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trial burn phase within part 270. The flow chart shown in Figure 1 indicates the points in the permitting process where
the proposed additions to public involvement activities would occur.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To avoid any potential confusion, it should be noted that facilities operating under interim status would not lose
this status if they do not follow the procedures the Agency is proposing in part 124 or 270. However, the permitting
agency may choose to pursue an enforcement action, not connected to the termination of interim status provisions,
including a requirement that the application be resubmitted or the notice be republished, if a facility fails to comply
with the requirements. Similarly, for a new facility, the permitting agency's recourse would be to require that the
application be resubmitted or the notice republished under the correct procedures, rather than permit denial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Overview of proposed requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA first proposes that a permit applicant must give notice and hold at least one informal public meeting before submitting
a RCRA permit application to EPA or the State. EPA believes this requirement will address the public concern that public
involvement occurs too late in the RCRA permit process. One purpose of the meeting is to inform the affected community
of the facility's proposed operations and its intent to apply for a RCRA permit in the near future. Another important
purpose of the meeting is for the applicant to solicit and receive public input. EPA believes that dialogue between
the applicant and the public, before the permitting process is initiated with the permitting authority, will allow
the public to raise important community issues early in the process, and will promote discussion between the public
and the persons seeking the permit. In this way, the public will have direct input to facility owners or operators;
at the same time, facility owners or operators can gain an understanding of public expectations and attempt to resolve
public issues well in advance of the draft permit. For example, facility owners or operators could address public
concerns through the permit application itself, by changing the proposed design or operation of the facility, or
through subsequent public interactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice and meeting also will assist in the generation of a mailing list of interested citizens. This list is a currently
required mechanism used in the distribution of notices and information concerning the facility at points throughout
the permit process. The permitting authority is responsible for developing a representative mailing list for public
notices under 40 CFR 124.10 (see also preamble Section A.2: Current Public Participation Requirements in the RCRA
Permit Process). Section 124.10 specifies the timing and content of such mailing lists. The pre-application meeting
will assist the permitting authority in identifying people or organizations to include on the list so that it is complete
and represents everyone who demonstrates an interest in the facility and the permit process. The permitting authority
may develop the mailing list, in part, from the pre-application meeting attendance list. It has been EPA's experience
that mailing lists often are not fully developed until the permitting authority issues the draft permit for public
comment. Since EPA seeks to increase public participation earlier in the process, generation of a mailing list should
precede such activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, EPA is proposing that the permitting authority provide public notice upon receiving a permit application.
Under this provision, the permitting authority would notify the public of proposed facility operations at a much
earlier stage than 40 CFR part 124 currently requires. Existing &sect;124.10 requires the permitting authority
to provide public notice of a facility's intention to obtain a RCRA permit, but only after the permitting authority
has received and reviewed the application and proposes to grant or deny the permit. Due to the volume and complexity
of information contained in a permit application, this process may take several years to complete from the time a permit
application is initially submitted. (See Figure 1.) For some facilities, the public has expressed a concern that
critical decisions about the facility already have been made by the time the permitting authority proposes the draft
permit decision. A requirement for a notice at the permit application stage would allow members of the public to review
a permit application at the same time as the permitting agency and inform the agency of any concerns or comments they
may have. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to involving the public earlier in the RCRA permitting process, the proposed provisions will also allow
the public to get an overview of the RCRA application and permitting process, and the parts played by the permitting
authority and the facility owner and operator in that process. Under the proposed rule, the permit applicant conducts
the pre-application meeting since it is the applicant who initiates the permit process by submitting a permit application.
The permitting authority issues the notice when it receives the permit application from the facility since, at that
time, EPA or the State will use its authority to begin review of the permit application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Third, the Agency is proposing a provision that will allow the Director the discretion to require the facility to establish
an information repository. An information repository is a central collection of documents, which could include
reports, summaries of data, studies, plans, etc., that the regulatory agency considers in evaluating the permit.
The collection would be set up by the applicant in a convenient and accessible location. An information repository,
similar to those required under Superfund and proposed under the RCRA Subpart S corrective action regulations of
40 CFR part 264 (see 55 FR 30798, July 27, 1990), would allow the interested public greater access to information, such
as the permit application, and other material relevant to the permit decision process. To maintain flexibility in
the permit process, and in recognition that information repositories may not be necessary for all facilities, the
Director will use his or her discretion, based primarily on the level of public interest, in requiring a facility to
establish an information repository. In situations where public interest is high, a locally established repository
may benefit a community by providing convenient and timely access to important information about a local facility.
If EPA or an authorized State decides to require a facility to establish a repository, it should be noted that only one
repository is needed to fulfill the intent of today's proposed requirement, whether the permitting process for that
facility is EPA-lead, State-lead, or joint federal-state.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Equitable public participation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency believes that affected members of the community should have an equal opportunity to participate in the
permitting process. EPA considers the community to be all residents in the vicinity of the facility who might be most
affected by the facility's operations. The Agency recognizes that local communities may be composed of a diverse
group of people who may not share English as a primary language. Therefore, for a notice to be effective, the Agency
is requiring under proposed &sect;124.30 that both the facility and the permitting authority make all reasonable
efforts to communicate with the various segments within the community. Multilingual public notices and fact sheets
may be necessary for some communities, for example, communities that contain a significant non-English speaking
population. Likewise, interpreters may need to be provided at public meetings and hearings. EPA understands that
developing multilingual notices and fact sheets, and providing translators, could be difficult to implement depending
on the size, composition, and diversity of the community. Also, resource constraints could be a factor when determining
what is a ``reasonable effort'' to communicate effectively with the public. EPA would like to solicit comments on
how the requirements proposed in &sect;124.30 could be implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a.1. Agency activities dealing with environmental justice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is placing heavy emphasis on environmental justice issues across all environmental programs. The Agency
has stated repeatedly that environmental justice is one of EPA's top priorities; all offices should consider environmental
justice issues during decision-making. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In December 1993, the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) established an Environmental Justice
Task Force to broaden discussion of these issues and formulate short and long-term recommendations for how OSWER
can integrate the Agency's environmental justice goals and objectives into all of OSWER's programs and activities.
Specifically, the task force has examined ways that OSWER can better address the concerns of minority populations
and low-income populations that are affected by OSWER-regulated facilities and may face disproportionately high
and adverse human health or environmental effects. The task force has included representatives from all OSWER program
and administrative offices, as well as other offices throughout the Agency that have an interest in OSWER's programs
and activities. The task force has met with representatives from citizen groups, industry, Congress, and state and
local governments to ensure that stakeholders have an opportunity to influence OSWER's environmental justice strategy.
The draft recommendations emerging from OSWER's Environmental Justice Task Force are consistent with and supportive
of the Agency's environmental justice goals and objectives, as well as the President's Executive Order on Federal
Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that this rule presents significant opportunities to be responsive to environmental justice
concerns in relation to specific OSWER-regulated facilities. The measures recommended in this proposed rule would
help enhance the level of public participation in the permitting process and thereby provide minority populations
and low-income populations with a greater voice in decision-making and a stronger opportunity to influence permit
decisions early in the process. In today's proposal, the Agency would like to solicit comments on ways to incorporate
environmental justice concerns into the RCRA public participation process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to public participation, some of the key environmental justice issues for the RCRA permitting program
include: (1) The siting of hazardous waste facilities; (2) the manner in which EPA should respond when confronted
with a challenge to a RCRA permit based on environmental justice issues; and (3) environmental justice concerns in
corrective action cleanups. The Agency requests comments on these aspects of the RCRA program in order to help identify
the need for additional rulemaking or policy guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has also begun to focus on how EPA's programs can take account of the ``cumulative risk'' and ``cumulative
effects'' associated with human exposure to multiple sources of pollution. Although the Agency does not expect to
address these issues in this rulemaking, EPA would like to solicit comment on suggested methodologies and procedures
for undertaking this type of analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the siting of a RCRA facility, EPA has in the past focused on geological factors to be considered when
siting a facility, but has not undertaken a concerted effort to address environmental justice issues associated
with the siting of a hazardous waste facility. The draft final report of the OSWER Environmental Justice Task Force
recommends that the Agency compile a national summary of existing State, tribal, and local government requirements
for siting with regard to environmental justice. The draft report also recommends that the Agency develop guidance
for State, tribal, and local governments on how to best site a hazardous waste facility in the light of environmental
justice concerns. In developing this guidance, the Agency would look to existing State and local requirements and
would consult with a wide range of public and private stakeholders. EPA has placed the OSWER Environmental Justice
Task Force Draft Final Report, April 25, 1994, into the docket for this proposed rule. The Agency is soliciting comments
on the recommendations in the draft final report, as well as on any additional steps that the Agency might wish to consider
in order to respond to environmental justice concerns associated with the siting of RCRA facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also interested in exploring appropriate responses when confronted with a challenge to a RCRA permit based
on environmental justice concerns. This issue has arisen in the context of recent challenges under Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act alleging that federal grants allocated to States to support State RCRA permit programs are being
administered in a discriminatory manner. The draft report of the OSWER Environmental Justice Task Force recommends
that the Agency first seek to mediate appropriate resolutions among affected citizens, the State, and the permittee.
Where necessary and prudent, the task force also proposes that the Agency explore ways of using risk and/or health
assessments to determine whether the affected community would face unacceptable human health or environmental
effects if the permit were issued. EPA requests comment on these recommendations as well as on the relationship of
Title VI to RCRA permitting and EPA's administration of state grants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency would also like to solicit comments on ways to incorporate environmental justice concerns into the RCRA
corrective action program. The OSWER Environmental Justice draft task force report recommends that the Agency examine
the current priority-setting method for the cleanup of RCRA corrective action sites to determine whether this system
adequately addresses environmental justice concerns. The task force has also recommended that environmental justice
policy governing cleanup actions at RCRA corrective action facilities be consistent with the policy implemented
under the Superfund program. The Agency would like to receive responses to these proposals as well as additional options
under the RCRA corrective action program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a.2. The relationship of today's rule with Indian Policy. Currently, EPA has the responsibility for ensuring the
implementation of the Subtitle C hazardous waste program on Indian lands. This includes the issuance of hazardous
waste permits. However, consistent with EPA's Indian Policy of 1984, the Agency will look directly to, and work with,
Tribal governments in determining the best way to implement these proposed public involvement requirements in Indian
country. This Indian policy recognizes the sovereignty of Federally-recognized Tribes and commits EPA to a government-to-government
relationship with these Tribes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Applicability of pre-application meeting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements for the pre-application meeting would pertain only to new permit applications, i.e., the initial
permit applications submitted by either new or interim status facilities. Therefore, the proposed pre-application
meeting requirements would not affect facilities that are submitting a permit renewal application under &sect;270.51
or applying for a permit modification under &sect;270.42. The additional requirements would not apply to cases where
a facility submits a permit renewal application, since information concerning the facility would have been previously
available to the public throughout the life of its operation. The facility would have completed the permit process
and conducted public involvement activities, usually through the permit modification requirements. For example,
the public will have had access to the administrative record for the facility, and the permitting authority already
would have developed a mailing list for the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, EPA is proposing today in &sect;124.32(a) that the permitting authority provide public notice when
a renewal application is submitted. This will provide the public an opportunity to further review the state of operations
at the facility, and be aware that the previously approved permit is expiring. The current opportunities for public
involvement throughout the duration of a facility's permit should be sufficient to keep the public informed of the
facility's activities. No change can occur to any permit without the public, at a minimum, being notified (see &sect;270.42
modification procedures). EPA would like to request comments on whether these current opportunities are indeed
sufficient, or whether the pre-application meeting requirements should apply to renewal permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, EPA does not believe the addition of a pre-application meeting requirement is necessary for requested
permit modifications. A facility proposing changes to its permit must apply for a permit modification under &sect;270.42.
Existing permit modification requirements have established public involvement procedures that must be followed
by the permitting authority and the facility before the final decision. These requirements are comparable to those
proposed today for permit applications submitted by new and interim status facilities. For example, significant
permit modifications, called class 2 or class 3 modifications, require a public meeting at the initiation of the permit
modification process to alert the public to changes the facility is proposing to make. Requiring an additional public
meeting would be redundant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA conducted a preliminary overview of State regulations containing public involvement requirements that could
potentially overlap with today's pre-application requirements. Approximately a dozen States have siting permit
regulations that contain public participation requirements, apart from RCRA requirements. The state siting requirements
could overlap with the pre-application meeting requirement proposed today. For example, the two permit processes,
i.e., for siting and RCRA permits, could share similar public involvement mechanisms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that it is important for the facility to host an informal and informational pre-application meeting
with the public. This meeting should focus on the operating requirements for the permit, including (1) whether the
facility should operate and (2) suggestions on how the facility should operate to protect human health and the environment.
The informal atmosphere of the meeting should encourage dialogue between the public and the facility, addressing
questions, such as the need for the facility, the proposed facility design, waste management practices, and safety
considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, the public meetings required by State siting regulations are more formal and may be hosted by the
State rather than the facility (although state siting regulations differ regarding which party is responsible for
conducting the siting meeting). The focus of the siting meeting is also different than a pre-application meeting,
usually examining such factors as the physical location of the proposed facility, including local land-use issues,
location sensitivity and suitability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, there may be a large gap in time between the public siting meeting (for the dozen states with public involvement
siting requirements) and the pre-application meeting. If a significant period of time were to elapse between the
siting meeting and the actual commencement of the RCRA permitting process, then the issues raised at the siting meeting
may not be fresh in the public's mind, or the public may not have the opportunity to raise new issues or potential solutions
until later in the process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the goals of each meeting are typically different, i.e., a decision for whether a new facility is located at
a particular site versus a decision on whether a facility should operate and how a facility could operate to protect
human health and the environment, EPA is not proposing today to allow siting meetings to automatically substitute
for the pre-application meeting. Some of the same issues may come up in either public meeting; however, this should
not deter the public from providing input at both meetings. Of course, if a State's requirements for siting meetings
meet the goal of today's proposal for a facility-led pre-application meeting, particularly in terms of opening a
dialogue between the applicant and the community, then they would probably fulfill authorization requirements.
In this case, the State would not have to require separate pre-application meetings. Refer to Section V, State Authority,
of this preamble for further information on flexibility within the State authorization process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA evaluated the option of allowing State siting meetings to substitute for the pre-application meeting, and, for
the reasons discussed above, decided not to include it in today's proposal. However, the Agency is requesting comments
on this issue. Specifically, the Agency would like to hear comments on reasons for or against allowing State siting
meetings to automatically substitute for the pre-application meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Applicability of the public notice at permit application. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements for the permitting authority to provide public notice when it receives a permit application, like
the pre-application meeting requirement, would not apply to permit modifications, because similar requirements
already exist for both class 2 and class 3 permit modifications that would make the requirement redundant. Specifically,
under &sect;270.42 (b)(2) and (c)(2), the permittee must send a notice of the modification request to all persons
on the facility mailing list and publish the notice in a major local newspaper. The notice is required to give, among
other things, the location where copies of the modification request and any supporting documents can be read and copied.
EPA believes that this requirement effectively substitutes for the public notice at application in the case of permit
modifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike the pre-application meeting requirement, the public notice requirement will apply to permit renewals. A
public notice for permit renewals is appropriate because the renewal application may be significantly different
from the original permit application, warranting early public involvement. For example, facilities may decide
to propose major changes, such as addition of a new unit, at the time of permit renewal, separate from any modifications
processed during its original permit. In this situation, the results would be an application that is new in certain
key respects. The permitting authority should give the public the same notification as it would for a new permit application,
even though the public may already be familiar with the general scope of operations at the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, since permit renewals generally occur 5 to 10 years after a facility is permitted and operating, a notice
of the permit renewal alerts the public to the fact that the facility plans to continue operating. A public notice at
permit renewal also would allow the public to compare changes between the initial approved permit and the permit renewal
application to determine the magnitude of any proposed changes. Finally, the notice could serve as a mechanism for
updating the facility mailing list, which may not contain a thorough list of people who are interested in the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements for the pre-application meeting and the notice at permit application would not apply to post-closure
permits. Post-closure permit applications raise a narrower set of issues and a narrower range of alternatives. The
public may be adequately involved through notices at the draft permit stage. Furthermore, the post-closure period
does not involve the same ongoing relationship between the facility and the community as the operating period. EPA
is requesting comments on whether current requirements are adequate to ensure public involvement, or whether today's
proposed requirements for public notice at application submittal should apply to post-closure permits.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
d. Applicability of the information repository. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information repository is a public participation tool that the permitting authority can use at any time during
the permit process. As proposed, the permitting authority may require the facility to establish a repository during
the permit review process for a new facility, or at any time during the life of a facility when the Director determines
a repository is warranted due to significant public interest in the facility. The need for an information repository
will be decided by the Director, based on decision criteria discussed elsewhere in today's preamble. It is important
to have a repository requirement that the Director can adapt to different facility situations and public information
needs. Thus, the Agency has allowed the Director the flexibility to decide whether and when a repository is established,
for what activity, how long it must be maintained, and where it is housed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. General considerations regarding public notices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing new requirements for public notice in order to address public concern that community members are
sometimes unaware of hazardous waste permitting activities or that public notice about a facility comes too late
in the RCRA process. EPA believes that appropriate public notice is necessary to fully inform communities and involve
them in permitting decisions involving hazardous waste facilities. By appropriate public notice, the Agency means
that sufficient information is provided in a timely manner to all segments of the public throughout the permit process.
Towards this end, EPA is proposing additional public notices throughout the permit process. These new notices will
require the permitting authority to notify the public when it reaches certain points in the permitting process (e.g.,
application submittal, prior to a trial burn). This provision will give the public the opportunity to become involved
in the decision-making process. As a result, the public may become more informed about the various steps of the permit
process and the time requirements of each step.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, a widely-distributed notice may reach interested individuals who otherwise may not have known about
the opportunity to be on the facility mailing list. To address this issue, EPA is proposing requirements under &sect;124.31(c)(1)
concerning the distribution of the public notice for the pre-application meeting. This notice will be the first activity
required by the RCRA permit process; EPA believes that stronger requirements resulting in a wider initial outreach
are appropriate at this juncture. EPA is not proposing that implementing agencies follow the new distribution requirements
for subsequent notices. Such a requirement would be redundant since, as a result of the widely distributed notice
of the pre-application meeting, the permitting authority would have a list of interested people that it could contact
as part of the mailing list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency recognizes that the means by which a notice is effectively distributed is highly community-specific.
The permitting authority may find any of a variety of distribution mechanisms effective, depending upon such factors
as population density, geographic location, expanse, and cultural diversity of a community, when such mechanisms
are used in conjunction with required notice activities. EPA has learned, through discussions with States, Regions,
and outside parties (environmental and industry organizations), of a number of mechanisms for distributing notices.
Facilities and agencies may voluntarily use the methods that are most practical for disseminating information throughout
their community. Several of these methods that go beyond today's proposed requirements, and which may be voluntarily
implemented, are discussed below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Press releases. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Permitting authorities and industry alike have used press releases to successfully alert the local community to
specific activities. A press release to one paper may be picked up by other local papers with no cost to the original
party. Press releases have the advantage of providing in-depth coverage of a subject in a forum that can be widely distributed
within a short timeframe. 40 CFR 124.10(c) specifically cites press releases as a method that permitting authorities
can use to promote public participation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Local cable tv channels.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many communities run their own cable channels for local news and activities. This medium may be used to target a local
audience, often at no charge. TV spots may be advantageous for delivering pertinent information about a hazardous
waste facility directly to people at home. The permitting authorities may also use the stations to broadcast logistics
for upcoming meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Local community groups.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The facility may enhance the distribution of information by including local community groups on the facility mailing
list. Such groups may have a particular interest in hazardous waste issues and can be effective in circulating the
information to a wider audience. Local religious establishments, for example, can be particularly useful in distributing
information locally. Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs), required under Section 301 of the Superfund
Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), can also be an effective group through which to disseminate notices.
LEPCs are composed of representatives from a variety of groups or organizations, for example, local elected officials,
law enforcement, fire fighting, health, and transportation personnel, community groups, and broadcast and print
media. Facility mailing lists can include other community groups, such as professional and trade associations,
planning commissions, civic leaders, and special interest groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Requirements for the pre-application meeting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing that the facility provide public notification of the pre-application meeting between the facility
and the public. This provision would apply to all RCRA facilities that submit a Part B Permit application for the first
time. The facility will have the dual responsibility of providing appropriate notice and conducting the meeting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the requirements for the pre-application meeting should apply to all RCRA TSD facilities. EPA emphasizes
that the pre-application meeting is meant to be flexible, informal, and informative. Owners and operators of hazardous
waste facilities, including owners and operators of small businesses, should be able to meet the proposed requirements
for the pre-application meeting without undue burden. EPA estimates that the costs associated with the pre-application
will be small. In addition, EPA believes that this approach will benefit the facility, as well as the public, in the
long run since the public will gain greater understanding of the facility's plans and responsibilities. As stated
above, earlier and more meaningful public involvement could streamline the permitting process, since issues and
concerns will be raised at the initial point of the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA solicits public comment on whether or not the Agency should require facilities to hold a pre-application meeting
and, if so, whether the requirement should apply to all facilities, or only particular facilities, such as facilities
conducting specific waste management practices, managing certain kinds of waste, or accepting off-site waste.
In addition, EPA requests comment on the proposed functions of the pre-application meeting as well as comments about
the notice requirements for the meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b.1. Providing notice of the pre-application meeting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency is proposing this requirement because EPA is concerned that the existing mechanisms for providing public
notice (found in 40 CFR part 124) may not work as effectively at the pre-application stage of the permit process as they
do later in the permit process. The main reason for this is that the permitting authority generally does not develop
the facility mailing list by the pre-application stage; it usually develops the list after the facility submits its
permit application. Consequently, there is no mailing list for the facility to utilize. These initial outreach efforts
will ultimately benefit the permit process by engaging interested individuals early in the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to require that the applicant provide notice of the pre-application meeting to the public, including
EPA and appropriate units of State and local government, in three separate ways. EPA has designed these requirements
to ensure effective public notice for the meeting. As proposed under &sect;124.31(c)(1), two of these requirements
are new approaches to providing public notice and apply only to the notice for the pre-application meeting. The third
is a current requirement under &sect;124.10(c)(2)(ii). EPA believes that since the notice for the pre-application
meeting is the first public notice in the RCRA permitting process and occurs so early in the process, i.e., possibly
before a mailing list is developed, these additional requirements are necessary to ensure widespread notice so that
the public is appropriately informed. All of the public notice requirements for the pre-application meeting must
contain the information proposed under &sect;124.31(c)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first requirement proposes that the facility must place the notice not only in a paper of general circulation within
the community where the facility is located, as currently required, but also in newspapers that cover each jurisdiction
adjacent to that community. EPA believes this approach is necessary to ensure that the facility appropriately notifies
neighboring jurisdictions in the event that a facility is located near a jurisdictional boundary. In these cases,
people who live near, but across the county or state line from, a hazardous waste facility that is applying for a RCRA
permit may not receive notice of the activity under the present scheme because the newspaper is not in general circulation
across that jurisdictional line. As a result, these people may not learn about the facility until much later in the
permit process or after the facility is permitted. This initial outreach requirement would avoid such a situation.
Interested persons could respond to this initial notice either by attending the pre-application meeting or by signing
up for the facility mailing list. In either case, the person would be on the list for subsequent notices that comply
with existing requirements in &sect;124.10(c)(2) (including requirements for the facility mailing list).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some states (especially in the western part of the United States), the geographic areas covered by a host county
or adjacent counties can be very large. In these cases, the requirement for the facility to give public notice in adjacent
counties may not be practical or useful. Therefore, in situations where the geographic area of a host jurisdiction
or adjacent jurisdictions is very large (hundreds of square miles), the newspaper notice shall cover a reasonable
radius from the facility, such that all potentially affected persons have the opportunity to receive notice. EPA
requests comment on how to implement this alternative notice provision in the regulations without prescribing a
specific formula or approach that may not be appropriate in all circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The required newspaper notices must appear as display advertisements within the newspapers. This provision clarifies
the form in which the official public notice must appear in the papers. As defined by this proposed rule, a display ad
must be of sufficient size to be seen easily by the reader. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends the display ad requirement to make information about the pre-application meeting more visible within
the newspaper. The display ad must be placed in a section of the newspaper that the average reader is likely to see, or
in a manner that otherwise gives the general public effective notice. Currently, most public notices related to RCRA
permitting appear as legal notices. However, EPA proposes to change this practice for the notice at pre-application
in response to public concerns that legal notices are not widely read. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA encourages facilities and permit writers, if it is within their means, to apply this requirement to other notices
published in the newspaper. The requirements proposed in today's rule are in no way meant to inhibit additional public
involvement activities that the owner or operator or the regulatory agency could carry out voluntarily.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second proposed mechanism for enhancing public notice of the pre-application meeting is a requirement that the
facility owner or operator post a sign on the facility property displaying information about the meeting. This requirement
will give clear notice of the facility location, and activity the facility is, or will be, conducting. The posted sign
must show the same information as the other notices, except for the requirement to include a facility map, which is
unnecessary. The sign must be large enough so that the wording is readable from the facility boundary; it should be
located where it will be visible to the public, including passers-by. The Agency encourages facilities to post similar
signs within the local community, where appropriate, to encourage people to attend the pre-application meeting.
In some cases, the option of posting additional signs around the community may be a cost-effective way for the facility
to communicate with the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third requirement is that the facility owner or operator must provide a radio broadcast announcement of the pre-application
meeting. This is a current mechanism for providing public notice in &sect;124.10(c)(2)(ii). The Agency is including
it within today's proposed requirements for the pre-application meeting in order to maintain consistency with existing
public notice requirements under &sect;124.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the years, EPA has received many questions from authorized states and the public concerning radio announcements.
Today's proposal requires a radio announcement to be broadcast from at least one local radio station serving the community,
which is the same as the current part 124 regulations. As mentioned earlier in the Equitable Public Participation
section, EPA considers the community to be all residents in the vicinity of the facility who might be most affected
by the facility's operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Facilities can, of course, go beyond the minimum requirement being proposed today. EPA provides the following suggestions
as guidance for those facilities interested in going beyond the proposed minimum requirements. In some rural areas,
community members may listen predominantly to one station; in this case, EPA recommends that the applicant use this
station as the vehicle for the notice. Some areas are part of a radio market (i.e., as defined by services such as Arbitron's
Radio Market Definitions) and have competing radio stations. Where there is more than one radio station, the facility
owner or operator should carefully consider the likely listeners of the radio stations in order to ensure a substantial
listener audience. For example, if the facility is located within a predominately Hispanic-American community,
the applicant should use the local Spanish language station as the vehicle for the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Areas with many competing stations are more likely to have listener groups that may be delineated by, for instance,
age, ethnicity, or income. In these situations, broadcasting the notice on several stations, or in more than one language,
may be beneficial. In all cases, EPA suggests that the announcement occur at listening hours with a substantial audience,
which will vary for each community as well as within listener groups. The facility may consult with radio stations
and community members to determine the best times to broadcast the public notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice of the pre-application meeting is perhaps the most important of the permit notices, since it is the first
notice of the permitting process for new or existing facilities. The applicant should make an attempt to ensure that
all interested citizens are aware of the pre-application meeting. The new requirements proposed today_display
ads, notices published across jurisdictional boundaries, and posted signs at facilities_are more likely to reach
a wider audience than a single notice in the legal section of the paper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In analyzing other approaches, such as applying the new pre-application notice requirements to all other RCRA public
notices, EPA found that the requirements may become burdensome to regulatory agencies, who must publish a number
of notices throughout the permitting process. (As proposed today, the facility bears the burden of the pre-application
meeting requirements.) EPA's goal in proposing this approach is the efficient use of resources for effective public
notice. EPA proposes a larger initial outreach effort to help establish a mailing list. By initiating a larger effort
early in the process, people who desire to be put on the mailing list are included as early as possible in the permit process.
The facility will conduct subsequent notices using the existing notice requirements, which have proven adequate
when accompanied by a well-developed mailing list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comment on the proposed requirements for public notice of the pre-application meeting. For example,
EPA would like comments regarding the practicality or usefulness of these requirements and their application within
the permitting process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b.2. Conducting the pre-application meeting. Today's proposed rule requires the applicant to hold at least one informational
meeting, open to all interested members of the public, before submitting a permit application. This meeting will
provide earlier public involvement opportunities in the RCRA permitting process, and enable the applicant to explain
facility plans and the scope of the project to the public. In addition, EPA intends this meeting to create a dialogue
with the community, raise public awareness, determine public views and questions raised with respect to the facility,
and provide the applicant with the opportunity to make changes to its application based on public comments. (The facility
may choose to hold additional meetings to answer questions raised at the pre-application meeting.) It is appropriate
for the facility to conduct the public meeting because the facility initiates the permit process and conducts business
in the area. The permit applicant must give the public adequate notice, at least 30 days before the date, of the pre-application
meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the meeting should be informal and informational. This approach is consistent with the preamble
discussion of public meeting requirements for Class 3 permit modification procedures (see 53 FR 37912, September
28, 1988). However, in contrast to the requirements for Class 3 modifications, today's rule would require the facility
to submit a record of the pre-application meeting, a list of attendees and their addresses, and copies of any written
comments or materials submitted at the meeting, to the Director. The facility must include this record as part of the
permit application and, if required, the information repository. The record requirement will provide the public,
especially people who are unable to attend the meeting, and the Agency with a summary of information and issues raised
at the pre-application meeting. The proposed rule does not require the permitting authority to attend the meeting.
The Agency believes that attendance by the permitting authority, in certain instances, may undercut one of the main
purposes of the meeting, which is to open a dialogue between the facility and the community. In some cases, attendance
by the permitting authority might be useful in gaining a better understanding of public perceptions and issues for
a particular facility. However, it should always remain clear that it is a facility-lead meeting. EPA believes it
is important for the public to understand that it is the facility's responsibility both to initiate the permit process,
by submitting an application to EPA, and to inform the public of its intentions. EPA would like to solicit comments
on whether the permitting agency should attend the pre-application meetings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the nature of the public meeting, EPA intends to provide facilities with considerable latitude. Through
discussions with community relations experts from a variety of backgrounds, EPA has found that ``public meeting''
means many things to many people. In most cases, however, it appears that people view public meetings as being similar
to public hearings. EPA would like to dispel the idea that public meetings must be similar to formal public hearings;
rather, EPA encourages facilities to be creative in their approach towards conducting the pre-application meeting,
in order to encourage constructive and open participation with people in the community. The facility may accomplish
this goal through any of a variety of meeting formats. EPA further encourages innovation in the type of public meeting
by allowing the facility to choose the medium by which it reports the record of the meeting to EPA, as long as the medium
provides an adequate record of the meeting. For example, facilities may choose to tape-record discussions at the
meeting or find another effective medium with which the public is comfortable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many guidance documents are available on how to conduct public meetings and community outreach. Among them are EPA
documents Community Relations in Superfund: A Handbook (January 1992, EPA/540/R&hyph;92/009), RCRA Public Involvement
Manual (September 1993, EPA 530&hyph;R&hyph;93&hyph;006), as well as publications by private interests. The applicant
may wish to consult these or similar publications for appropriate guidance on how to conduct an appropriate meeting
with the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of the guidance source, EPA believes that the facility, in meeting regulatory requirements, should also
consider the following factors to conduct what EPA believes to be an appropriate and effective public meeting: first,
the applicant should give special attention to process, logistics, content and trouble-shooting when preparing
for a public meeting; second, the applicant should provide appropriate public notification, as required by &sect;124.31(c),
identify all sectors of the community that the facility will potentially affect, as required by &sect;124.30(a),
and provide outreach to interested citizens and officials. All these factors are important to ensure that the audience
is representative of the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility should encourage public participation through selection of a meeting date, time, and place that are
convenient to the public. The facility should select the date and time of the public meeting to correspond to times
when the public is most available; this may require the facility to conduct the meeting after normal business hours.
The applicant should make sure that the meeting place has adequate space and is conducive to the type of meeting that
the applicant will conduct. The applicant should take care in the development of the content of the meeting to meet
the requirement of ``sufficient detail to allow the community to understand the nature of the operations to be conducted
at the facility and the implications for human health and the environment'' under proposed &sect;124.31(a). To meet
the ``sufficient detail'' requirement, the applicant should have a clear meeting agenda that states the exact reasons
for the meeting and the specific objectives of the meeting. The applicant shall give an overview of the facility in
as much detail as possible, such as identifying the type of facility (i.e., commercial or private), the location of
the facility, the general processes involved, the type of wastes generated and managed, and implementation of waste
minimization and pollution control measures. In addition, the applicant should provide information about risk
to the public, where available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, trouble-shooting potential problems will help the meeting to run smoothly in the event of unplanned obstacles.
Trouble-shooting may involve planning for equipment failures, a shortage of parking spaces, or demonstrations,
as well as locating facilities for handicapped individuals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requirement for public notice at permit application.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Today's proposal would also require EPA or the State to publish a public notice upon receipt of a permit application.
EPA proposes that the permitting authority send the notice to everyone on the mailing list. These requirements are
consistent with the notice requirements under &sect;&sect;124.10 and 270.42. Unlike the proposed pre-application
meeting requirement, the permitting authority must also publish this notice for permit renewals (see Section A.4:
Applicability of public involvement requirements, of today's preamble discussion). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information requirements for the public notice will give people a clear opportunity to contact the appropriate parties
for questions and suggestions, sign up on the facility mailing list, and locate the appropriate documents, such as
the permit application, for review. The permitting authority must provide the name and telephone number of the facility
and permitting agency contacts. EPA suggests that the permitting authority designate a community affairs specialist
as the appropriate contact person. The permitting authority must also provide an address to which people can send
requests to be put on the facility mailing list. EPA believes that the public should have this opportunity during the
permit process, and that the notice at application is a good mechanism for announcing this opportunity. Today's proposed
rule requires the permitting authority to provide the notice; however, EPA would like to solicit comments on whether
the permitting authority or the facility should be responsible for providing the notice at application submittal.
While a person may request to be put on the mailing list at any time during the permit process, EPA intends this requirement
to ensure that the permitting authority alerts the public early in the permit process. Finally, EPA is requiring the
notice to include specific information about the facility operations, facility location, and the location where
the public may review and copy versions of the permit application and other important documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that these requirements significantly increase the opportunities for, and the effectiveness of, public
participation within the permitting process. The requirement for a public notice will tell the public when an application
for a permit has been received by the permitting authority. It would also provide information on where the permit application
is available for review by the public and, thus, would allow interested people to begin review of the permit application
at the same time as EPA or the State authority. The public would have the opportunity to review all aspects of the permit
application in its initial form, before EPA or the State review the application for completeness. The public has the
opportunity to make suggestions and raise issues for consideration by the permitting agency at any time during the
agency's review of the permit application. Consequently, the permitting agency will receive public input earlier
in the permit process as well as later, i.e., after the proposal of the draft permit. Another benefit of requiring such
a notice is that it may alert the agency to facilities generating high public interest. The public notice will highlight
public attention concerning a hazardous waste facility. Public interest and concerns may be expressed to the permitting
authority in the form of letters, phone calls, and requests to be put on the facility mailing list. This early stage
could be one potential point where the Director may choose to require the facility to establish an information repository.
Furthermore, by providing important and timely information at the beginning of the permit application review stage,
the permitting authority can better inform the public about the steps of the permit process and the amount of time required
for each step.

EPA believes that the public input that the permitted authority will receive early in the process will assist in the
review of the permit application and result in the development of a draft permit that is responsive to community concerns.
Once the permitting authority completes the draft permit, or the notice of intent to deny the permit, and proposes
it to the public, then the public has the opportunity to review that decision, including any changes that occurred
to the original permit application, since they will be reflected in the draft permit. These changes could include
changes in response to the public comments EPA may have received during its review of the permit application.

d. Requirement for an information repository.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed &sect;&sect;124.33(a) and 270.30(m) would provide the Director with explicit authority to require the
permit applicant or permittee, respectively, to establish and maintain an information repository. The repository
would allow interested parties to: (1) Access reports, plans, findings, and other informative material relevant
to the facility and the particular issues at hand; and (2) receive information on appropriate opportunities for involvement
during a variety of permitting decisions. EPA expects that the Director would consider requiring a facility to establish
a repository in a limited number of cases where the community expresses a high level of interest. A high level of community
interest could be demonstrated, for example, in such ways as written requests from members of the public, or press
coverage. However, the final decision for requiring the repository is at the Director's discretion. The Director
may also specify any appropriate time period for the repository. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As provided in proposed &sect;124.33(b), the information repository will contain all public information that the
Director determines to be relevant to public understanding of permitting activities at the facility. In general,
the Director would require the facility to make available those reports or documents that provide the most relevant
information about the facility and the best technical basis for decision-making. The information repository could
include some of the following items: copies of the permit application, technical documents directly supporting
the application, maps (i.e., sketched or copied street map) of the proposed location of the facility, notice of deficiencies
(NODs), or summary reports of ground-water and air monitoring results at the facility, if such reports exist for the
facility location. The repository should also contain information on how the public may participate and become involved
during the permitting process. For example, EPA may contribute a fact sheet that outlines public involvement opportunities
within the permit process and how to be put on the facility mailing list. Similarly, the facility may provide information
in the repository on any additional public involvement activities it chooses to conduct. Examples of background
material the facility may maintain in the repository include copies of relevant RCRA regulations and related information,
e.g., fact sheets. The facility may exclude from the repository any material it claims to be confidential business
information (CBI). Examples of CBI could include trade secrets, commercial, or financial information whose general
availability could cause substantial harm to the facility's competitive position. The contents and size of the information
repository may differ among sites, depending upon the reasons for setting up the repository, the permitting phase
of the facility, and the site-specific characteristics of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility is responsible for site selection and maintenance of the information repository. The facility should
place the repository at a local public library, town hall, county courthouse, community college, public health office,
or another public location within reasonable distance of the facility. In instances where such a location is not feasible
due to the remote location of the facility, the Director may require the facility to establish and maintain the repository
at some other suitable location. In most instances, the information repository should not be at the facility. Interested
communities have expressed a greater comfort level with siting the repository at a public location, instead of within
facility boundaries. The repository must also be open to the public during reasonable hours or accessible by appointment.
Reasonable hours could include, for example, weekend and evening hours of access (e.g., beyond normal business hours),
depending, among other things, on work schedules of the interested individuals, the degree of public interest in
the facility permitting activities, the convenience of the location of the repository, and the timing of public meetings
or hearings. In these situations, EPA encourages facilities to select a location that already has extended hours
of operation, such as a local library. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA encourages facilities to establish the information repository at a location that has reasonable access to a photocopy
machine, if possible. Such a location would be more convenient for the people who wish to make copies of any of the materials
at reasonable cost. For example, some of the public locations mentioned previously should, in most cases, have a photocopy
machine on the premises. If it is not possible, the facility may want to explore other options, such as providing extra
copies of documents that people can keep without charge or at reasonable cost.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In cases where physical space to house the documents is limited, a potential solution for the facility, where resources
allow and capability is available at the location, is to copy documents onto microfiche or CD&hyph;ROM. Either of
these possible options requires little space and would discourage document theft or vandalism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;124.33(d), the Director will specify requirements that the applicant must satisfy in informing the
public of the existence of the information repository. At a minimum, the Director will require the facility owner/operator
to notify individuals on the mailing list when the facility establishes the repository. The Director may also require
the facility to provide public notice in a local newspaper. As a practical matter, the facility may, in some cases,
choose to provide the relevant information to the permitting authority so that it may include the information in other
required notices. The facility owner/operator would identify the EPA or State office contact and a facility contact
person to answer questions related to the repository. EPA suggests that the permitting authority designate a community
affairs specialist as the appropriate contact person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information repository EPA is proposing today closely resembles the repository proposed under Subpart S of the
Corrective Action Rule (see 30798 FR, July 27, 1990) and is similar to the repositories established at Superfund sites
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). EPA's CERCLA experience
has demonstrated that the public's interest in nearby hazardous waste activities is served effectively by a repository.
Without a local repository, the burden falls on citizens to locate and contact the appropriate officials who are knowledgeable
about the site in Regional EPA or State offices, which could be located far from the site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are three major differences between the information repositories in today's proposal and the repositories
included in the CERCLA program. First, Superfund requires information repositories at all sites on the National
Priorities List (NPL), whereas, under today's proposal, the Director would use his or her discretion on a case-by-case
basis. All communities may not desire or request every option available for public involvement. In most situations,
an information repository may not be necessary and could become an unnecessary resource drain for the local community
hosting the repository. Providing discretion to the Director will allow the facility and community to use their resources
in the most efficient manner. In making such a determination, the Director would consider the degree of public interest
(which could, for example, be demonstrated through written requests from the public to set up a repository), as well
as the proposed location of the facility, the proposed types and volumes of wastes to be managed, and the type of facility.
Furthermore, the Director may consider requiring information repositories at certain Class 3 modifications or
at other stages within a permit where there is a high level of public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second major difference between the CERCLA and proposed RCRA repositories is that CERCLA repositories for NPL
sites generally house the administrative record for CERCLA actions. Under the RCRA permitting program, and as described
in proposed Subpart S, EPA Regional offices, or authorized States, maintain administrative records, which provide
documentation of the basis of EPA's decisions and other parts of the record, at Regional office location. Because
the RCRA permitting record is already available for public inspection at a separate location, the Agency does not
believe that it is necessary to duplicate the entire administrative record for RCRA facilities at information repositories.
The administrative record developed during the permitting process is often large, and could become burdensome to
the Agency and the facility if it were duplicated in its entirety in an information repository. In addition, the space
required to house an information repository, if it were required to be a duplicate of the administrative record, may
severely limit prospective repository locations in a community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third major difference between the CERCLA and proposed RCRA provisions relates to the point in the waste management
process when an information repository is established and maintained. Information repositories are established
at NPL sites to give the public the opportunity to keep informed during the cleanup process. On the other hand, the repository
proposed for certain RCRA facilities could be established by the facility at any time during the RCRA permitting process
or during the life of the facility. In either case, the facility will set up the information repository to provide information
to the community about the specific issues at hand. Therefore, the Director may require the facility to operate the
information repository during the permit application process only or the active life of a facility, whichever best
applies to the facility and the community. For new facilities, this provision means that the Director might instruct
the facility to establish an information repository before construction of the facility. EPA is concerned that the
information repository for a RCRA facility could become cumbersome if the Agency prescribes specific content and
duration requirements in a regulation. Therefore, EPA believes that the Director should designate timeframes and
details for the contents of the information repository on a case-by-case basis, in keeping with the goal of enhancing
public participation in the permitting process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency chose what it believes to be the most flexible approach, that is, one that allows permitting authorities
to readily respond to community demands. However, the Agency recognizes that questions may exist regarding this
approach and requests comment on several aspects of the information repository. First, the Agency seeks comments
on making the information repository an optional, as opposed to mandatory, tool within the permitting process. Second,
EPA solicits comments on making the repository mandatory for some types of units; for example, the Agency could require
all commercial facilities or facilities managing certain types of waste to establish information repositories.
Third, EPA requests comments on the location of the repository and the point in the permitting process when it might
be appropriate for the Director to require certain facilities to establish or terminate a repository. Fourth, the
Agency seeks comments on what documents the facility should include within the repository as a minimum, and the process
by which those documents are selected.

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The main purpose of this section of the rule is to clarify the combustion modification provisions found in Appendix
I of &sect;270.42. EPA is aware that there has been some confusion over the description of modifications listed under
section L.7 of Appendix I, which covers the shakedown and trial burn phases of operation for combustion units. Through
today's changes, EPA intends to make these modification classifications easier to understand and implement. Today's
proposal clarifies and describes the phases of shakedown and trial burn in more detail, thus, making it easier for
the facility to distinguish between modification classifications. By making it easier for a facility to select the
appropriate classification for each modification activity, the proposed rule will make compliance with the modification
process easier.

This section also proposes minor revisions to &sect;270.42(d) of the modification procedures and addresses those
modification requests that are not classified in the Appendix I table of &sect;270.42. Today's proposal clarifies
how facilities may implement and utilize the provision for other modifications in &sect;270.42(d).

2. Background Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA first promulgated procedures for RCRA permit modifications in 1980 as part of the initial regulations establishing
the RCRA permit program. This system of modifications consisted of two types: Major and minor. Major modifications
followed the same public notice and comment procedures as for permit issuance, while minor modifications required
only approval by the permitting authority. ``Minor modifications'' were defined as any modification contained
in a short list in the regulations; all other modifications were deemed ``major.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA gained experience in implementing these procedures and decided that the Agency could improve the modifications
process. One of the Agency's primary concerns was that most modifications were processed under the major modification
procedures since few modifications were listed as minor. Since many less consequential permit changes and facility
improvements were subject to extensive ``major'' modification procedures, EPA found that facilities were discouraged
from making improvements to upgrade the facility to be more protective. At the same time, EPA and the States were diverting
their resources to address minor modifications, instead of addressing modifications with greater environmental
significance, or other permitting and enforcement actions. In considering how to address these concerns, EPA determined
that the procedural structure needed modifying in order to classify the many activities that did not fall easily into
only the major and minor categories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA amended the procedures for facility-initiated permit modifications on September 28, 1988 (see 53 FR 37912).
The goals of this rule were to allow for additional flexibility in processing permit modifications and to provide
for an appropriate level of public involvement in the decision-making process. The main feature of these revised
procedures was a system of three classes of permit modifications, ranging from Class 1 for the least significant changes
to Class 3 for the most significant facility modifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA continues to believe that Agency and State permitting authorities must focus time, efforts, and resources on
substantive changes to protect human health and the environment. With three classes of procedures, permitting authorities
can classify modifications more accurately, according to their environmental significance, than they could under
the former system. Individual examples of modifications are classified in a detailed appendix to the rule (Appendix
I to &sect;270.42).

3. Technical Corrections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's rule, EPA is proposing certain technical corrections in &sect;&sect;270.42(a)(1)(ii), 270.42(b)(2),
and 270.42(c)(2). One correction would change the reference for notifying appropriate units of state and local government
in each of these paragraphs to &sect;124.10(c)(1)(x), in order to correct a typographical error. At present, these
sections incorrectly reference &sect;124.10(c)(ix), which is the reference for notifying the facility mailing
list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing to make a technical correction to &sect;270.42(b)(6)(i). In this paragraph, the term ``notification
request'' should be changed to ``modification request.'' It is clear from the preamble to the September 28, 1988 permit
modification rule (see 53 FR 37916) that EPA intended that the deadline for EPA action be related to the date that the
modification request is submitted to the permitting authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Unclassified Modifications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the development of the September 1988 permit modification rule, EPA recognized that classifying all possible
permit modifications under the items listed in Appendix I of &sect;270.42 would be impossible. Therefore, the Agency
provided a procedure in &sect;270.42(d) to enable facilities to submit modification requests for changes that are
not specifically listed in Appendix I. For these unclassified modifications, facilities must either use the Class
3 modification procedures or, alternatively, request that the Agency make a determination that the activity is either
a Class 1 or 2 modification. In general, requests for a classification determination would be attached to the modification
request. In making its determination whether to process the request as a Class 1, 2, modification instead of a Class
3, the Agency would consider the similarity of the specific modification to others listed in Appendix I and the criteria
listed in &sect;270.42(d)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After several years' experience, EPA has found that very few unclassified modifications have been processed using
this procedure. EPA believes that both facilities and permit writers may be restricting themselves to only the classification
examples that are in Appendix I. EPA is also concerned that in those cases where &sect;270.42(d) is used, the Class
3 modification procedure may be automatically selected, without consideration of whether the permit activity is
less significant and should be reclassified to a lower category.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EPA believes that Appendix I offers a good starting point for classifying modifications, facilities and the
permitting authority should both make additional efforts to use the flexibility in &sect;270.42(d) when proposing
modifications. Use of this flexibility will allow permit writers to better focus their efforts and resources on modification
procedures that are necessary and appropriately tailored to the substantive changes proposed. Therefore, EPA believes
that facilities should use the flexibility contained in &sect;270.42(d) when their site-specific permit changes
are not listed in the Appendix I table. To address this situation, EPA is proposing to modify the wording in &sect;270.42(d)
to clarify that unclassified modifications can be processed under Class 1 or 2 procedures, if this lower classification
is more appropriate. EPA is also proposing to add a notation to Appendix I that instructs facilities to use the procedures
in &sect;270.42(d) if a proposed modification is not listed in Appendix I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA would like to clarify that the temporary authorization provision in &sect;270.42(e) may be used
by the facility, subject to approval by the permitting authority, to implement unclassified modifications as well
as classified ones. In other words, the permitting agency may grant a temporary authorization, without prior notice
and comment, for activities that are necessary for facilities to respond promptly to changing conditions to be protective
of human health and the environment. Temporary authorizations have a term of up to 180 days; the permitting agency
may grant temporary authorizations for Class 2 or 3 modifications that meet the criteria in &sect;270.42(e), including
compliance with the part 264 standards. Activities that will be completed before the 180 day term expires do not require
a modification request. If a facility knows up front that the activity will take longer than 180 days to complete, it
should submit a modification request at the same time as its request for temporary authorization.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RCRA permits for new incinerators and boilers and industrial furnaces (BIFs) address four distinct phases of operation
after construction. The four phases are: Shakedown, trial burn, post-trial burn operation, and final operation,
which lasts for the duration of the permit. The permitting authority establishes operating conditions for each of
these phases in the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The shakedown phase of operation lasts from the initial start up after construction until the trial burn. The shakedown
phase prepares the unit for the trial burn. During this period, possible mechanical difficulties are identified
and the unit reaches operational readiness by achieving steady-state operating conditions immediately prior to
the trial burn. Federal regulations limit the shakedown period to 720 hours of operation using hazardous waste feed;
the permitting authority may allow one additional period of up to 720 hours with cause. Permit conditions limit operations
during this period; the permit sets hazardous waste feed and other waste management practices and requires the facility
to monitor certain key operational indicators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The trial burn, which typically lasts several days, is the actual testing that the facility conducts, with permitting
agency oversight, to (1) determine whether a combustion unit can meet the performance standards required by the regulations
and the permit, (2) establish the final facility operating conditions for the term of the permit, and (3) provide data
on which the permit authority can base a risk assessment. The trial burn plan contains the parameters for conducting
a trial burn. The trial burn plan is part of the original permit for new facilities and must be approved by the permitting
agency before the facility can conduct a trial burn. The facility often tests several sets of operating conditions
during the trial burn. The conditions are designed in order to determine the range of operating conditions where the
unit meets the performance standards. For example, the facility may set one trial burn condition to determine what
the maximum hazardous waste feed can be. The trial burn demonstrates the range of operating conditions that allow
the facility to comply with the performance standards. The permit writer uses the results of the trial burn to define
the operating conditions that the facility will operate under during the permit term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The post-trial burn phase starts after the trial burn and lasts an average of 3 to 9 months. The permit specifies operating
conditions that apply during this phase. Federal regulations require the permittee to analyze the results of the
trial burn and submit them to the Agency within 90 days of completion of the trial burn, or later if approved by the Director.
Also during this period, the facility may submit, and EPA may process, a permit modification to revise the final operating
conditions to reflect the results of the trial burn and any other information. This phase ends once the permitting
agency and the facility complete all necessary permit modifications and the final operating conditions take effect.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final operating conditions are effective for the life of the permit, unless the facility's permit is modified
pursuant to 40 CFR 270.41 or 270.42. The permit writer bases the conditions on actual trial burn data that reflect the
conditions under which the facility met the performance standards during the trial burn.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Structure of today's proposal. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Confusion has existed, at times, over the descriptions of modifications for certain items listed in section L of Appendix
I to &sect;270.42, which covers incinerators and BIFs; in particular, the confusion has concerned changes during
the shakedown period of operation and trial burn. How to interpret these modification classifications may be unclear
in certain situations. In order to avoid further confusion or potential delays in determining these classifications,
the Agency is proposing to reorganize and clarify Section L.7. of Appendix I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, Appendix I of &sect;270.42 places items regarding the shakedown period, trial burn plan, and post-trial
burn operation into the same section, i.e., section L.7. EPA believes that placing those items regarding the shakedown
period in one section and items concerning the trial burn plan into another section, along with describing each item
more precisely, will clarify the intent behind each description. This reorganization will make it easier to classify
individual modification requests and ensure that the permitting agency processes the requests under the appropriate
procedures. EPA proposes today that all modifications regarding the shakedown period will remain in section L.7.
and all items regarding the trial burn will move to new section L.8. The existing section L.8. will become section L.9.
An explanation of the proposed revisions to sections L.7. and L.8. of the Appendix follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proposal, Class 2 will remain the highest classification for changes to the trial burn and shakedown period
permit conditions. Further, the permitting agency will continue to process many changes under the Class 1 procedures,
with prior Director approval. One reason for these classifications is the short period of operation for both the shakedown
and trial burn phases. The permitting authority must be in a position to respond quickly to requests for changes that
are necessary to ensure thorough testing of the unit. In addition, operating conditions during the shakedown period
are generally more restrictive than the final operation conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Shakedown. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix I to &sect;270.42 currently classifies modifications addressing the shakedown period for a permitted
combustion unit in items L.7. a. and b. EPA today proposes to simplify item L.7.a. by applying it only during the shakedown
period and moving the references to the trial burn plan and post-trial burn operation to newly proposed section L.8.
The permitting agency should not process under L.7.a. any modifications that are classified in other items in Appendix
I. Today's proposed rule will not change item L.7.b., which allows the Director to authorize an additional 720 hours
of operation as a Class 1 modification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA also proposes to reclassify proposed item L.7.a. as a Class 1 permit modification, with prior approval of the Director.
Our basis for this change is that the narrower scope and limited duration of the shakedown period means that a facility's
activities would be less significant than the activities found under the existing L.7.a. One example of a modification
under proposed item L.7.a. would be a change in combustion temperature to increase the unit's efficiency. The purpose
of the shakedown period is to prepare the unit for the trial burn and, thus, any changes made during the shakedown period
would not affect long term operation. The shakedown period can last no longer than 720 hours of operation, with only
one extension possible. As stated previously, modification items related to the trial burn will now be addressed
by the permitting authority under proposed section L.8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Trial burn. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today, EPA is proposing to create a new section L.8. in Appendix I to address modifications to permit conditions during
the trial burn. These conditions are contained in the approved trial burn plan, which is a part of the RCRA permit. EPA
has structured this section to progress from changes before any trial burns are completed to those after a trial burn
has been conducted, including changes made to reflect the results of a successful trial burn. The format of the new
section L.8. is as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to revise Appendix I to address changes to the trial burn plan before the trial burn is complete (items
L.8.a. and L.8.b). Under the proposed scheme, the permitting authority will consider changes to the trial burn plan
a Class 2 permit modification, unless they are minor, in which case they will be Class 1, with prior Director approval.
One example of a minor change would be an increase in the secondary combustion chamber temperature for a trial burn
condition that is testing the destruction and removal efficiency for organic wastes. One example of a major change
would be an increase in the waste feed rate. Please note that classifying changes as minor with regard to the trial burn
is not a new requirement; it was previously listed under item L.7.c. However, to reflect the fact that the trial burn
conditions are contained in the trial burn plan, EPA is deleting any references to ``operating requirements set in
the permit'' from the modification table. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA expects that permittees may request technical changes in the trial burn plan under L.8.a. while the permitting
authority is on-site immediately before, or during, the trial burn. These changes address unanticipated issues
and are often necessary for effective and protective operation and testing during the trial burn. A representative
of the permitting authority, usually the permit writer, is typically at the facility during the trial burn. The Agency
encourages permit writers and facilities to write trial burn plans with the flexibility to accommodate alterations
during the trial burn. The permitting authority can expedite the modification process by delegating approval authority
to one of its agents. The permit itself can also specify what level of permitting agency staff has authority to approve
these minor changes. In deciding whether to allow such changes on-site, we encourage the permit writer to consider
the criteria contained in the February 16, 1989, Trial Burn Observation Guide. Of course, the final permit conditions
would limit the permittee to those conditions that met the performance standards during the trial burn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a facility conducts a trial burn and submits the results to the permitting agency, the facility may request another
trial burn. The facility must, then, submit a new trial burn plan. EPA is proposing to revise Appendix I to clarify this
situation. Item L.8.c. specifically relates to situations where the facility did not meet the performance standards
set in the trial burn plan and the facility proposes another trial burn, or portions of a trial burn, at improved conditions.
Item L.8.c. addresses conducting additional tests to replace one or more of the failed conditions of a trial burn.
Before the facility can conduct these tests, it must revise the conditions in the trial burn plan and the permitting
agency must approve the revisions through a permit modification. In general, the permitting agency will not approve
the modification request to conduct another trial burn unless the facility has provided a sound technical basis,
demonstrating that the revised operating conditions are likely to meet the performance standards set in the permit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing to classify item L.8.c. as a Class 2 permit modification. The Agency recognizes that this classification
represents a change from the preamble language in past incinerator technical regulations. An early incinerator
rule preamble states that ``if compliance has not been shown and an additional trial burn is necessary, the permit
may also be modified under &sect;122.17 [old minor permit modification language] to allow for an additional trial
burn'' (See 47 FR 27524, June 24, 1982). This 1982 preamble language describes a trial burn retest of a failed condition.
Since 1982, EPA has gained considerable experience regarding trial burns. EPA now believes that if a facility does
not meet the regulatory performance standards during the trial burn, then the public needs to be involved before the
facility revises the trial burn plan and conducts another test, because the facility's failure under certain conditions
may raise concerns. Therefore, EPA believes that the additional public participation requirements of the Class
2 procedures are appropriate for this item. (See proposed &sect;270.74(c)(7) for the analogous procedures for interim
status combustion facilities.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, EPA is proposing to add item L.8.d to address changes to the permit conditions that are in effect during
the limited period called the post-trial burn period. (These modifications would currently be addressed under item
L.7.a.) Because any changes during the post-trial burn period will be limited in duration, similar to those during
the shakedown period, EPA is also reclassifying post-trial burn period modifications from Class 2 to Class 1 permit
modifications, with prior approval of the Director.

For the last item in this section of Appendix I, EPA is proposing to move existing item L.7.d. to L.8.e. This item describes
revising the final operating conditions to reflect the results of the trial burn. Changes in the final permit should
reflect the operating conditions under which the facility met the required performance standards during the trial
burn. EPA does not propose changes to the wording of this item.

C. Requirements Regarding the Trial Burn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose and Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purposes of this section of the proposed rule are (1) to make the permitting procedural requirements for interim
status combustion units more equivalent to current permitting requirements for new units, particularly with regard
to trial burns, and (2) to clarify some administrative permitting procedures for combustion units. In addition,
this section contains proposed requirements that will provide for more public involvement opportunities, both
earlier in the combustion permitting process and at key points throughout the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements in this section apply only to combustion units at both interim status and permitted facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Summary of Proposed Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing today to create a new &sect;270.74, which will contain permitting procedural requirements for interim
status combustion units. This proposed new section is a consolidation of &sect;&sect;270.62(d) and 270.66(g),
which currently contain permitting procedural requirements for interim status incinerators and BIFs, respectively.
Proposed &sect;270.74 is virtually identical to &sect;&sect;270.62(d) and 270.66(g), except where EPA is proposing
additional permitting procedural requirements for interim status units. EPA intends the additional requirements
to make the procedural requirements for interim status units more equivalent to the permitting procedural requirements
for new units, and to expand public involvement opportunities during the trial burn phase. The flow chart shown in
Figure 2 indicates the points in the permitting process where the proposed activities would occur. For instance,
the administrative procedural changes EPA is proposing in &sect;270.74 will require interim status facilities
to submit a trial burn plan with their initial Part B applications. Section 270.74 further states that the permitting
agency must approve the trial burn plan before the facility conducts the trial burn. These proposed explicit requirements
will ensure that interim status facilities conduct trial burns in accordance with approved plans, as do permitted
facilities, and do not perform the trial burns before submitting their applications. In another permitting procedural
change, EPA proposes to clarify the Director's authority to allow additional trial burns and to deny a permit to an
interim status unit if the Director does not believe that the unit is capable of meeting performance standards.

EPA is proposing a new regulatory requirement, not addressed in previous regulations, which pertains to post-trial
burn conditions at interim status combustion facilities. EPA is proposing that, upon completion of the trial burn,
interim status facilities must operate only under conditions that passed and were demonstrated to meet the performance
standards of &sect;264.343 (for incinerators) or &sect;&sect;266.104 through 266.107 (for BIFs), and only if the
successful trial burn data are sufficient to set all applicable operating conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning public involvement, the Agency is proposing additional public participation opportunities in the combustion
permitting process by requiring public notices at key points in the trial burn process. The Agency would like to build
on the public involvement requirements in today's proposed rule and expand them to the trial burn stage. The Agency
believes that public involvement opportunities should continue beyond the initial permit application stage and
throughout the permitting process. For instance, the proposed rule requires the permitting authority to give public
notice of the actual trial burn for both interim status and new combustion facilities. It is important to inform the
public of the pending burn and give members of the public an opportunity to participate in this later phase of the permitting
process. As mentioned previously in the public involvement segment of the preamble, expanded public participation
in the RCRA program and decision-making process is a high priority for the Agency.

3. Current Trial Burn Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Trial burns are an important step in the permitting process for combustion facilities. There are differences in the
permitting process for new and interim status combustion facilities, which stem from the original composition of
the regulated community in 1980 when EPA first promulgated the RCRA Subtitle C regulations. At that time, Congress
granted existing facilities interim status if they complied with notification and application requirements, so
they could continue operating while pursuing a permit. Anyone proposing a new facility now had to obtain a permit prior
to construction. This distinction between existing and proposed facilities led to differences in the permitting
procedural requirements for combustion units. For example, existing combustion facilities that have interim status
must conduct a trial burn prior to permit issuance, whereas proposed facilities must obtain a permit before they may
construct the combustion unit and then conduct a trial burn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Current trial burn procedures for permitted combustion facilities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The trial burn procedures for new combustion units are currently set forth in &sect;270.62(b) for incinerators,
and &sect;270.66(c) for BIFs. These regulations require new hazardous waste incinerators and BIFs to submit trial
burn plans with their initial Part B permit applications. The actual trial burn is conducted after: (1) The public
has reviewed and commented on the permit application; (2) the permitting authority has reviewed and approved the
permit application; and (3) the facility has constructed the combustion unit. The permitting authority uses the
results of the trial burn to determine whether a facility can meet the applicable performance standards and, if it
does, to establish the final operating conditions in the permit that enable the facility to comply with those standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility or the permitting authority must initiate changes to the trial burn plan through the permit modification
procedures in &sect;&sect;270.41 through 270.42 (see Section B. Permit Modification Procedures). The permitting
authority must approve any modifications before the facility can implement them. Where results of a trial burn show
non-compliance with performance standards, a facility would typically be required to either: (1) revise the trial
burn plan to test new conditions; or (2) submit a request to the permitting authority to modify the permit to permanently
exclude the conditions that resulted in non-compliance. Both the permit review/ determination process and the permit
modification process have built-in opportunities for public involvement, including procedures for appealing
decisions made by the permitting authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Current trial burn procedures for interim status combustion facilities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The trial burn procedures for interim status combustion units are currently in &sect;&sect;270.62(d) and 270.66(g).
These requirements are not as detailed as the requirements for new combustion facilities, although it is common practice
for owners/operators of interim status facilities to follow many of the requirements for new facilities. For example,
the interim status regulations in &sect;&sect;270.62(d) and 270.66(g) require facilities to submit the results
of the trial burn before permit issuance, but do not explicitly state that facilities must receive permitting agency
approval of the trial burn plan before conducting the burn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures for interim status and new combustion facilities differ in other areas. Contrary to permitted facilities,
interim status facilities do not have a permit during the trial burn stage; thus, the permit modification procedures
do not apply. As a consequence, the permitting agency currently does not have the same authority to regulate post-trial
burn changes by interim status facilities as it does for new combustion facilities, especially in the case of incinerators
[BIFs are more highly regulated under interim status]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike the requirements for new facilities, there is no opportunity for public involvement in the permitting process
for interim status combustion facilities until after the facility has conducted the burn and the permitting agency
issues the draft permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that many of the requirements for new combustion facilities are appropriate for interim status facilities;
the Agency proposes to change the regulations to apply some of these requirements specifically to interim status
facilities. It is the Agency's intent, in changing the regulations, to ensure protection of human health and the environment
and provide a greater opportunity for public involvement in the permitting process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Discussion of Proposed Permitting Requirements for Trial Burns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to consolidate the permitting procedural requirements for interim status combustion facilities
by moving the incinerator and BIF interim status permitting requirements, found in &sect;&sect;270.62(d) and 270.66(g),
to proposed &sect;270.74. In addition, EPA is proposing to amend these requirements to make them more equivalent
to the permitting requirements for new combustion units. EPA believes that consolidating the permitting requirements
for interim status combustion facilities and distinguishing them from the requirements for permitted facilities
will simplify the interim status trial burn process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consolidation and movement into proposed &sect;270.74(a) and (b) will not change the majority of the regulatory
language in the existing provisions. However, EPA is proposing additional language that will make interim status
permitting procedures more consistent with new facility permitting procedures and expand the opportunities for
public participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also revising provisions for submitting data in lieu of a trial burn, &sect;270.19 for incinerators and &sect;270.22
for BIFs, to reflect actual Agency practice. As currently written, this waiver, which the permitting agency can grant
to either permitted or interim status units, could be seen as relatively open-ended; yet, in actual practice, permitting
authorities have allowed facilities to use the provisions only under a narrow range of circumstances. EPA believes
that granting the waiver only under a narrow range of circumstances is appropriate for the reasons discussed below
and, therefore, is proposing to revise this provision to specifically restrict application to this narrow range.
This revision to the regulatory language will ensure consistency among permit writers. It could also benefit facilities
in the following way. The proposed rule will make explicit the strict circumstances under which a permitting agency
will grant a waiver. Once a facility knows these circumstances, it will not misuse its resources in compiling a waiver
request that the permitting agency will not grant; instead, the facility can focus its resources on developing a trial
burn plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is concerned that units constructed at different locations at different times, or with slight design or operating
differences, may not perform in an identical manner. For example, if the locations are at different altitudes, the
differences in atmospheric pressure could affect the performance of the units. In addition, there would likely be
different operators running the units at different locations; thus, the units may not be operated in an identical
manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the theory of submitting data from other units in lieu of conducting a trial burn is sound;
however, sufficient data is not available to ensure that the theory could be applied to real world situations without
imposing strict limitations. EPA believes that most combustion units will need to conduct trial burns in order to
develop operating conditions that ensure compliance with the performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To this end, EPA is proposing today to codify EPA's current policy by making the following changes: (1) Replace ``sufficiently
similar'' with ``virtually identical''; and (2) specify that the units must be located at the same facility. The ``data
in lieu of'' provision, therefore, would not apply to mobile treatment units when moved from site to site, since they
would not be located at the same facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Submittal of trial burn plans for interim status facilities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Today's proposed rule would require interim status hazardous waste incinerators (proposed &sect;270.74(a)(1))
and BIFs (proposed &sect;270.74(b)) to submit a trial burn plan with their initial Part B permit applications. EPA
believes that the trial burn plan for interim status facilities should be subject to public notice and available for
review with the initial Part B application, as it is for new facilities seeking permits. EPA's objective in proposing
these revisions is to involve the public much earlier in the interim status facility permitting process than current
regulations require.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends that today's requirements regarding submittal of the trial burn plans for interim status facilities
will: (1) Specify the point in the permit process when the facility submits the trial burn plan, which will be the same
point as for new facilities; and (2) explicitly provide that interim status facilities must conduct the burn in accordance
with an approved plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since EPA is proposing a specific point for trial burn plan submittal in the proposed rule, i.e., with the Part B application,
the Agency is deleting the current provisions that refer to the trial burn plan submittal (&sect;&sect;270.62(d)
and 270.66(g)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Approval of trial burn plans for interim status facilities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In &sect;270.74(c)(1), EPA is explicitly requiring that any interim status combustion facility that seeks a permit
must obtain the Director's approval of the trial burn plan before conducting the trial burn. EPA is also proposing,
in &sect;270.74(c)(4), that the Director, after approving a trial burn plan, must specify a time period during which
the facility shall conduct the burn. EPA adds this latter requirement to ensure that facilities conduct trial burns
in a timely manner. The Agency believes that requiring the permitting agency's approval of interim status trial burn
plans will ensure that the facilities submit plans that reflect, and the permitting authority reviews the plans in
the context of, current EPA policy and guidance. EPA also believes that today's proposed requirements will ensure
that, in most cases, the burns will supply adequate data and information to set permit operating conditions. This
proposed requirement for interim status facilities is equivalent to the permitting procedures for new facilities
seeking permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted, however, that unlike the procedures for new facilities, approval of the trial burn plan for interim
status facilities is on a separate track from the rest of the permit application. As mentioned earlier in this preamble,
a new combustion facility must receive a permit before building the combustion unit and conducting the trial burn.
Review and approval of trial burn plans for these facilities is concurrent with review and approval of the entire permit
application; the trial burn plan is just one of many components. However, for interim status facilities, the permitting
authority does not issue the draft permit, or the notice of intent to deny the permit, until after the facility conducts
the trial burn. Since facilities must conduct the burn in accordance with a plan approved by the permitting agency,
it is clear that the plan must be on a separate approval track from the rest of the permit application. Furthermore,
interim status facilities typically must revise their permit applications to reflect the results of the burn, so
that the conditions set in the permit can be based on conditions known to ensure compliance with the performance standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Notices of trial burns. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's proposed rulemaking, EPA is seeking to expand opportunities for public involvement during the trial burn
phase of the combustion permitting process for both new and interim status facilities. EPA requests comments on whether
the facility or the permitting authority should be responsible for publishing the public notices discussed in the
following sections.

c.1. Permitted combustion facilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing, in &sect;270.62(b)(6) for incinerators and &sect;270.66(d)(3) for BIFs, to require the Director
to send a notice of the expected trial burn schedule to all persons on the mailing list and to appropriate units of State
and local government. As mentioned previously in the preamble, the trial burn plan is available for public review
at other points in the permitting process (e.g., at application submittal, at draft permit issuance, and at final
permit determination). Thus, unlike the notice requirement for interim status facilities, explained in the section
below, the notice of the trial burn schedule for permitted facilities does not refer to the trial burn plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that, in a limited number of situations, circumstances beyond the control of the facility or the permitting
authority could delay a trial burn. It is not EPA's intent, in these limited situations, to require an additional notice
with a revised burn schedule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice must contain the following information, specified in &sect;&sect;270.62(b)(6) or 270.66(d)(3): (1)
Name and telephone number of the facility's contact person; (2) name and telephone number of the permitting authority's
contact office; (3) location where the approved trial burn plan and any supporting documents are available for review;
and, (4) the expected time period during which the facility is scheduled to conduct the trial burn. Including this
information in the notice enables members of the public to speak with a person who is knowledgeable about the trial
burn plan, and to be aware of an imminent trial burn in their community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c.2. Interim status combustion facilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;270.74(c)(3), EPA is proposing notice requirements for interim status facilities that are similar to the
requirements for permitted facilities. The proposed rule will require the Director to send a notice to all persons
on the mailing list and appropriate units of State and local government, informing them of the proposed approval of
the trial burn plan and the expected trial burn schedule. The Agency is requiring this notice before the permitting
authority approves the plan in order to provide an additional opportunity for the public to review the final draft
plan. It should be noted that, for interim status facilities, the Director's decision to approve the trial burn plan
is not subject to administrative appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that the draft plan submitted with the initial Part B application may differ significantly from the
final version that the permitting authority approves. EPA wants to ensure that the public has a chance to see the revisions
prior to approval and the actual burn. EPA would like to solicit comments on whether the Agency should establish a comment
period for interim status facilities prior to approving the trial burn plan, in view of the fact that, for permitted
facilities, the public has an opportunity to comment on the draft trial burn plan as part of the draft permit process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, there are less public involvement opportunities for interim status facilities than there are for permitted
facilities, with regard to the review of trial burn plans. As mentioned previously, for permitted facilities, the
public has the opportunity to review the trial burn plan at both the application and draft permit phases before a trial
burn occurs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice must contain the information specified in proposed &sect;270.74(c)(3). The notice should include the
following: (1) Name and telephone number of the facility's contact person; (2) name and telephone number of the permitting
authority's contact office; (3) location where the draft trial burn plan and any supporting documentation are available
for review; and (4) a schedule of activities that are required prior to permit issuance, including the date by which
the Director expects to approve the plan and the expected time period during which the facility is scheduled to conduct
the trial burn and submit results to the Director (refer to proposed &sect;270.74(c)(4)). Including this information
in the notice enables the public to speak with a person who is knowledgeable about the trial burn plan, receive or review
additional information, and learn of an imminent trial burn in their community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated earlier, interim status facilities will conduct the trial burn prior to permit issuance, as required by
current regulations. Although the public will have an opportunity to review the trial burn plan, since it must be submitted
with the initial Part B application, in accordance with today's proposed requirements in &sect;270.74(a) or (b),
a significant amount of time may elapse before the Director approves the plan and announces the facility's expected
schedule for the burn. EPA believes that it is important to inform the public of the Director's proposed approval of
the trial burn plan, separate from the rest of the Part B permit application, and the anticipated time period for conducting
the burn. Again, this is consistent with the Draft Combustion Strategy goal of promoting public involvement in the
trial burn stage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
d. Post-trial burn period at interim status combustion facilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's rule, EPA is proposing that interim status combustion facilities be subject to the performance standards
of &sect;264.343, for incinerators, or &sect;&sect;266.104 through 266.107, for BIFs, upon completion of the trial
burn. During the post-trial burn period, interim status facilities must operate only under conditions that passed
and were demonstrated to meet these performance standards, and only if the successful trial burn data is sufficient
to set all applicable operating conditions. EPA has provided information, in its June 1994 Guidance on Trial Burn
Failures, for determining whether conditions resulted in non-compliance and under what circumstances successful
data from the trial burn is sufficient to set all applicable operating conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal is more stringent than current regulations and practices. Currently, no regulations provide for setting
post-trial burn conditions at interim status facilities. EPA believes that these proposed regulations will give
the permitting agency the direct authority it needs to restrict these interim status facilities' operations to ensure
that they are in compliance with the basic performance standards applicable to permitted facilities during the post-trial
burn period. Establishing these requirements will ensure that interim status combustion facilities are operating
in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment during the post-trial burn period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed requirement for interim status facilities is consistent with the post-trial burn requirements for
permitted facilities. It is also consistent with EPA's draft model permit (September 1988), which has wording for
the permitting agency to incorporate into combustion permits regarding temporary restriction of operating conditions
following the trial burn.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's proposed rule supports and builds upon the language contained in the draft model permit. EPA is proposing
that if the trial burn data for an interim status combustion facility show non-compliance with any set of the performance
standards, then the facility will be required to (1) immediately cease operating under the condition(s) that resulted
in non-compliance and (2) notify the Director. The facility may only continue operating if there are enough successful
data from the trial burn to set all applicable operating conditions, and the facility is able to modify its design and/or
limit its operating conditions to operate within the performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, one component in establishing a complete set of operating conditions is determining a maximum and a minimum
combustion temperature. A maximum temperature is important for the metals volatilization standard; a minimum temperature
is important for the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) standard. For the sake of simplicity, this example
assumes that the facility tested under only two temperature conditions, a high and low temperature, and that all other
variables remained constant. By setting minimum and maximum temperature limits, the test burn can establish an operating
``envelope,'' in other words, a range of temperatures within which the facility can operate safely in compliance
with the performance standards. If the trial burn results show that the high temperature was successful, but that
the low temperature was not sufficient to meet performance requirements, then there may not be enough successful
data to set all applicable operating conditions. In this example, the facility would be required to stop operating.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, following up on the above example, a facility may want to run tests over a range of temperatures in
order to avoid shutdown. By running multiple temperature tests, the facility could attempt more conservative tests,
as well as tests that would push the combustion unit's operating envelope. For instance, a facility may plan to conduct
multiple tests to establish its minimum operating temperature. Thus, a facility may choose to test at two temperatures,
e.g., low and medium. If the trial burn results show that the low temperature could not meet the performance standards,
but the medium temperature did, then enough successful data would exist to set all applicable operating conditions.
In this scenario, the facility would restrict its operations to burn between the medium and the high temperature during
the post-trial burn period and, thus, would continue operating within the performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends for the facility to be responsible for restricting its operations if any of the trial burn data show non-compliance
with performance standards. If the facility wishes to continue operating under restricted conditions during the
post-trial burn period, it must provide to the Director a description of the conditions under which it is operating,
and a preliminary explanation of how the conditions were determined to be sufficient to ensure that the unit functions
within the performance standards. EPA is proposing to require facilities to submit this information with the trial
burn results. As currently required in &sect;&sect;270.62(b)(7) and (8) for incinerators, and 270.66(d)(3) and
(4) for BIFs, facilities must submit the results of the trial burn and any data from the trial burn within 90 days of conducting
the burn. As part of the proposed consolidation of the permitting procedural requirements for interim status combustion
facilities, EPA has also reiterated this requirement by incorporating it, by reference, into &sect;270.74(c)(5).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing, in &sect;270.74(c)(6), to give the Director the discretion to further restrict operating conditions
during the post-trial burn period to ensure that the unit is operated within the performance standards. The Director
will make a determination on the need for further restrictions after reviewing the trial burn data and the preliminary
explanation submitted by the facility within 90 days of the trial burn. The Director will inform the facility, in writing,
of any operational restrictions that he or she is imposing on the facility beyond those listed by the facility in its
preliminary explanation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e. Additional trial burns. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing permit modification procedures (&sect;270.42) contain provisions to address additional trial burns
at permitted combustion facilities. As mentioned previously, public involvement opportunities are built into
the permit modification procedures. The procedures require the permitting authority to notify the public when any
change is made to the existing permit through these procedures. Since the permit modification procedures do not apply
to interim status facilities, EPA is proposing, in &sect;270.74(c)(7), to specify requirements for additional
trial burns at interim status combustion facilities. As discussed in the previous section, if any results of a trial
burn at an interim status combustion facility show non-compliance with any set of the performance standards, the
facility must restrict its post-trial burn operations to conditions that passed and demonstrated compliance with
performance standards. At this point, there are two potential courses of action a facility may follow. On one hand,
the facility may choose to revise its Part B application to exclude those conditions. A facility that opts for this
course of action is, in essence, choosing not to pursue those conditions in its final permit. For example, if the facility
failed conditions relating to burning of aqueous wastes, it may decide to restrict its long-term operations by handling
only non-aqueous wastes; the facility would then reflect that decision in its permit application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, a facility may choose to revise its trial burn plan to address the reasons for the failure and then conduct
an additional burn under improved design or operating conditions. EPA believes that the majority of facilities that
fail trial burn condition(s) will choose this latter course of action in order to establish permit conditions that
meet their needs for long-term operation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that there may be a misconception that permitting authorities allow facilities to run the same conditions
over and over again without making any changes. The Agency would like to remove any confusion over its policy regarding
performance of additional trial burns when a test condition fails. It is important first to recognize that a facility
spends a considerable amount of time and resources on the trial burn, and intends to pass the first time. An informal
poll of EPA Regions showed that only a dozen additional trial burns for incinerators have occurred to date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, EPA has clarified, in its Guidance on Trial Burn Failures (June 1994), the circumstances under which
facilities would be allowed to run additional trial burns. According to this guidance, facilities may submit a request
to conduct an additional trial burn to the Director. As part of this request, the facility should demonstrate that
it has investigated the reasons for the failure and describe planned substantive changes to its process. A facility
should not be allowed to retest under the same design and operating conditions at which it failed. The facility should
demonstrate in a revised trial burn plan that the changes to its design and/or operations are sufficient to prevent
failure from reoccurring. The Director reviews, and either approves or denies, the request. The Director should
not approve an additional trial burn unless the facility has demonstrated satisfactorily that the changes proposed
in the revised trial burn plan are likely to meet the performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the trial burn guidance, existing EPA policy allows for facilities to conduct additional trial burns.
Current regulations, on the other hand, do not specifically address permitting procedures for interim status combustion
facilities for the limited number of situations when facilities would request additional burns. Today's proposed
rule establishes procedures for these situations and builds upon EPA's current policy by incorporating the circumstances
described in guidance into proposed regulatory language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;270.74(c)(7), interim status combustion facilities may request an additional trial burn.
According to the proposed section, the facility's request for an additional trial burn must contain an explanation
of the reasons for the previous trial burn failure, as well as a revised trial burn plan that has substantive changes
to address the reasons for the previous failure. EPA encourages facilities that pursue this option to fulfill the
above requirement by expanding the preliminary explanation that they are required to provide in order to continue
operating during the post-trial burn period (as discussed in the previous section). The Agency believes that these
provisions, along with the requirement that the permitting agency approve trial burn plans before the facility conducts
the burn, will help ensure that facilities conduct trial burns properly and the public is informed throughout the
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes it is important to inform the public when the permitting authority anticipates an additional trial burn.
Thus, in proposed &sect;270.74(c)(7), the rule will require the Director to inform the people on the mailing list
and appropriate units of State and local government once he or she has reviewed the revised trial burn plan and has tentatively
decided to approve it. This notice will provide the public with an opportunity to review the revised plan, and see the
rationale for the additional burn. EPA wants the public to be aware of the reasons why the facility believes the additional
run will be successful. The Director's decision to approve a revised trial burn plan is not subject to administrative
appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
f. Denial of permit application after the trial burn. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There may be occasions when a combustion facility cannot demonstrate compliance with the performance standards
through the trial burn, or has not demonstrated to the Director that an additional burn is likely to address the causes
of the previous failure. In the case of permitted facilities, the Director may choose to terminate the permit. Existing
regulations in &sect;270.43 provide the Director with the authority to terminate a permit for cause, following procedures
set forth in part 124. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA would like to provide similarly clear authority to the Director in the case of interim status combustion facilities.
Existing regulations in &sect;270.29 provide the Director with authority to deny a permit application, pursuant
to procedures in part 124. In order to clarify the applicability of this provision to trial burn failure situations,
EPA is proposing, in &sect;270.74(c)(8), to provide specific authority for the Director to deny a permit, pursuant
to procedures in part 124, for an interim status combustion facility, based on the facility's inability to demonstrate
compliance with the performance standards. It is not EPA's intent, in providing this authority, to imply that the
Director would deny a permit automatically if the facility failed any of the trial burn plan conditions. Every facility,
permitted and interim status alike, will have the option of requesting and proving that it can meet the requirements
for an additional burn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with EPA's goal of involving the public at key points in the permit process, EPA would like to reiterate that
the current procedures for permit denial, set forth in part 124, include requirements for the permitting authority
to notify to the public of intent to deny the permit application.

EPA is soliciting comments, in section 4.a.1: Agency activities dealing with environmental justice, on several
items relating to environmental justice. For instance, EPA is interested in receiving comments on ways to incorporate
environmental justice concerns into the RCRA public participation process. EPA is also requesting comments on the
need for additional rulemaking or policy guidance for incorporating environmental justice into certain aspects
of the RCRA permitting program, such as corrective action. The Agency is also interested in receiving comments on
suggested methodologies and procedures for undertaking analysis of ``cumulative risk'' and ``cumulative effects''
associated with human exposure to multiple sources of pollution. Finally, EPA is soliciting comments on some of the
recommendations developed by the OSWER Environmental Justice task force, discussed in section 4.a.1.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In section 4.c: Notices of Trial Burns, EPA is requesting comments on whether the permitting authority or the facility
should be responsible for providing public notices during the trial burn stage. EPA is also requesting comments,
in section 5.c.2: Interim Status Combustion Facilities, on whether the Agency should establish a comment period
for interim status facilities prior to approving the trial burn plan, in view of the fact that, for permitted facilities,
the public has an opportunity to comment on a draft trial burn plan as part of the draft permit process.

A. Applicability of Rules in Authorized States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified states to administer and enforce the RCRA program within the
state (see 40 CFR part 271 for the standards and requirements for authorization). Following authorization, EPA retains
enforcement authority under sections 3008, 7003, and 3013 of RCRA, although authorized states have primary enforcement
responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to enactment of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, a state with final RCRA authorization
administered its hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of the federal program. The federal requirements no longer
applied in the authorized state, and EPA could not issue permits for any facilities in that state, since only the state
was authorized to issue RCRA permits. When new, more stringent federal requirements were promulgated or enacted,
the state was obligated to enact equivalent authority within specified timeframes. However, the new federal requirements
did not take effect in an authorized state until the state adopted the requirements as state law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, HSWA amended RCRA to add section 3006(g) (42 U.S.C. 6926(g)). Under section 3006(g), new requirements
and prohibitions imposed under HSWA authority take effect in authorized states at the same time that they take effect
in nonauthorized states. EPA is directed by statute to implement those requirements and prohibitions in authorized
states, including the issuance of permits, until the state is granted authorization to do so. While states must still
adopt HSWA-related provisions as state law to retain final authorization, the HSWA requirements are implemented
by EPA in authorized states in the interim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposal is promulgated pursuant to pre-HSWA authority. These provisions, therefore, would become effective
as RCRA requirements in states with final authorization once the state has amended its regulations and the amended
regulations are authorized by EPA. However, EPA would like to encourage States to adopt the changes proposed today
expeditiously, and implement them as part of their own programs as rapidly as possible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of this rule are proposed under pre-HSWA authority. This section discusses the implications of the
pre-HSWA authority on EPA's and the states' implementation, and the schedule for state adoption of these new requirements.

a. Part 270_Hazardous Waste Permitting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of today's proposal that would affect the permitting and permit modification procedures for combustion
units (BIFs and incinerators) are proposed under pre-HSWA authority. These provisions include revised &sect;&sect;270.22(a)
and 270.19(d) which clarify allowable circumstances for using the ``data in lieu of trial burns'' in connection with
permitting combustion units; proposed &sect;270.74, and revisions to &sect;&sect;270.62 and 270.66 for permitted
units, which would add new procedures for public involvement in the trial burn planning and trial burn phases for both
permitted and interim status combustion facilities, make interim status procedures more equivalent to permitted,
and require interim status facilities to comply with performance standards during the post-trial burn period. In
addition, the proposed amendments to the permit modification provisions of &sect;270.42 (to distinguish further
between the shakedown and trial burn phases when modifying permitted combustion units) are also based on pre-HSWA
provisions. These provisions of the proposal, since they are based on pre-HSWA authority, will apply immediately
only in those states that do not have RCRA authorization. In authorized states, these requirements will not apply
until the states revise their programs to adopt requirements under state law that are at least as stringent and have
these new requirements approved by EPA.

b. Part 124_Public Participation Requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA desires to provide for, encourage and assist public participation. This proposed rule would establish procedures
to promote better and more timely information sharing between the public, the state, EPA, and the facility applicant.
The following is required under the part 124 regulations to comply with new public participation requirements: A
pre-application meeting, a notice of application, and an information repository. However, these provisions, since
they are based on pre-HSWA authority, will apply immediately only in those states that do not have RCRA authorization.
In authorized states, these requirements will not apply until the states revise their programs to adopt requirements
under state law that are at least as stringent and have these new requirements approved by EPA.

2. Procedures Applicable to Pre-HSWA Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
40 CFR 271.21(e) requires that states that have final authorization must modify their programs to reflect federal
program changes and must subsequently submit the modifications to EPA for approval. The deadlines for state modifications
are set out in &sect;271.21(e)(2), and depend upon the date of promulgation of final rules by EPA, announcing the program
changes. For example, if a final regulation based on this proposal is promulgated by EPA before June 30, 1995, the deadline
by which the states must modify their programs to adopt this regulation would be July 1, 1996 (or July 1, 1997 if a state
statutory change is needed). These deadlines can be extended in certain cases (see 40 CFR 271.21(e)(3)). Once EPA
approves the modifications, the state requirements become RCRA subtitle C requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with authorized RCRA programs may already have requirements similar to those proposed today. These state
regulations have not been assessed against final federal regulations to determine whether they meet the tests for
authorization. Thus, similar provisions of state law are not considered to be authorized RCRA requirements until
they are submitted to EPA and evaluated against final EPA regulations. Of course, states may continue to administer
and enforce their existing standards as a matter of state law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States that submit their official applications for final authorization less than 12 months after the effective date
of final standards are not required to include standards that are at least as stringent as these standards in their
application. However, states that submit final applications for final authorization 12 months or more after the
effective date of the final standards must include standards that are at least as stringent as these standards in their
applications. 40 CFR 271.3 sets forth the requirements that states must meet when submitting final authorization
applications. Because the proposed public participation requirements in &sect;270.74 represent a significant
upgrade to the combustion unit permitting process, EPA strongly encourages States that have not yet adopted the BIF
rule (56 FR 7134, February 21, 1991) to adopt these new public participation procedures concurrently with their BIF
rules, rather than deferring their adoption to the much later deadline that would apply under the Cluster Rule to this
new regulation. It should be noted that in situations where EPA retains permitting authority for BIFs (because the
State has not yet received authorization for BIFs), EPA may implement both the permitting and public involvement
procedures described in today's proposed rule. In this joint permitting situation, EPA would be the responsible
Agency for the BIF permitting requirements in unauthorized States that are not authorized to issue BIF permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the overall effect of this proposed regulation would increase the stringency of the RCRA permitting
processes. Therefore, all authorized states will be obligated to modify their programs to adopt these requirements
when they are finalized by EPA, unless their existing state programs and laws are deemed by EPA to be equivalent in effect.
For those states which are obligated to modify their programs to adopt these requirements when they are finalized
by EPA, &sect;271.21(e) deadlines for state modifications will apply accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing today's proposed regulations, EPA was sensitive to impacts on existing State programs. The proposed
requirements may be viewed as performance objectives the Agency wants States to meet. It is not EPA's intent to restrict
States from using similar activities that accomplish the same objectives. Therefore, EPA will allow latitude and
room for interpretation when reviewing state modifications for adopting these regulations.

VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis pursuant to Executive Order 12866

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether a regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and to the requirements
of the Executive Order, which include assessing the costs and benefits anticipated as a result of the proposed regulatory
action. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1)
Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; (2) create serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned
by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs
or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB has determined this is a significant rule under Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order
12866, this section of the preamble summarizes the potential economic impacts of the proposed RCRA Expanded Public
Participation and Revisions to Combustion Permitting Procedures rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the economic impact analysis for today's proposed rule, the Agency's best estimate is that the requirements
regarding expanded public participation before and during permit application would result in an incremental national
annual cost of $130,000 to $380,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the annualized incremental national cost of the permitting requirements in today's proposed rule is
estimated to be between $0 to $520,000. EPA expects that much of the effect of the permitting provisions in today's
proposed rule will be to clarify and codify current practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the economic impact analysis for today's proposed rule, the Agency's best estimate is that the requirements
of today's proposed rule would result in an incremental national annual cost of $130,000 to $900,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A complete discussion of the economic impact analysis is available in the regulatory docket for today's proposed
rule in a report entitled ``Economic Impact Analysis for the Proposed RCRA Expanded Public Participation and Revisions
to Combustion Permitting Procedures Rule.''

A. Cost Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section summarizes estimated costs and potential impacts of two aspects of today's proposed rule: (1) Expansion
of opportunities for public involvement in the permitting process, and (2) modification of combustion unit permitting
requirements. These two pieces of the proposed rule affect a different universe of facilities at different stages
in the permitting process and, thus, are presented separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Expanded Public Involvement Opportunities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the requirements of the expanded public involvement portion of today's proposed rule apply only to new hazardous
waste treatment, storage, and disposal permit applications. With the exception of the information repository requirement
(see below), the expanded public involvement requirements do not apply to post-closure permits and permit modifications.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA estimates that, over the next ten years, the bulk of new permit applications will be submitted by the 159 interim-status
boilers and industrial furnaces (BIFs). In addition, based on information provided by the Regional permit writers,
EPA estimates that an additional 53 to 127 new treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (for a total of 212 to 286
facilities) will submit permit applications over the next ten years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed rule includes several requirements that would result in direct costs to facilities submitting
new permit applications. The analysis estimates the costs to all affected facilities of (1) Preparing a public notice
announcing the intention to submit a permit application and to hold a public meeting; (2) disseminating the public
notice in local newspapers and over the radio; and (3) holding a public meeting and preparing a transcript. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, for communities with a non-English speaking population, the rule will require the facility to ``make
all reasonable efforts to communicate with the community in ways that reach all segments.'' Based on conversations
with RCRA and Superfund Regional community relations specialists and on data about existing RCRA facilities, this
analysis assumes that between 5%&hyph;30% of the facilities (11 to 86 facilities over the next ten years) will fulfill
this requirement by publishing multi-lingual notices and providing an interpreter at the public meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the rule will give the Director the discretion to require a facility to set up an information repository,
based on the level of public interest or other factors. This requirement can apply anywhere in the permitting process,
including post-closure permits, permit renewals, and permit modifications. Thus in addition to the interim status
BIFs and the new facilities mentioned above, the repository requirement can apply, at the discretion of the Director,
to the approximately 4,100 treatment, storage, and disposal facilities that EPA expects will undergo permit renewals,
modifications, or closure over the next ten years. EPA estimates that 15&hyph;20% of the estimated 212 to 286 facilities
submitting a new Part B application, and 1% of the 4,100 already-permitted facilities (73 to 98 facilities total)
would be affected over the next ten years by the repository requirement in today's proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost per facility of the above requirements is approximately $5,000 to $14,000. Annualized over a ten-year
period, using a 7% discount rate, the resulting national annual cost of the expanded public involvement requirements
is estimated to be between $130,000 to $380,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Modification of the Permitting Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Direct costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's proposed rule includes two new permitting requirements that have direct cost implications for the regulated
universe: (1) Changing the ``data in lieu of'' requirements, and (2) specifying the events that follow a trial burn
failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, interim status combustion facilities have the option of submitting ``data in lieu of'' a trial burn for
a unit that is ``sufficiently similar'' to an already-permitted unit. Today's proposed rule proposes changing the
requirements for ``data in lieu of'' by requiring the units to be ``virtually identical'' and to be located at the same
facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on information from trial burn contractors, preparing a trial burn plan and conducting a trial burn costs about
$110,000 to $550,000 per facility. Submitting ``data in lieu of'' a trial burn is assumed to cost approximately the
same as preparing a trial burn plan, or $10,000 to $50,000. The net incremental cost of denying the ``data in lieu of''
option would be $100,000 to $500,000 per affected facility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA estimates that between zero and eight percent (0&hyph;13 facilities total) of the interim-status BIFs could
incur a cost of doing a trial burn due to this proposed rule. The resulting annual national cost is $0 to $520,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The low end of the affected facility universe is ``zero'' because, although submission of ``data in lieu of'' a trial
burn is an option under current regulations for a facility with ``sufficiently similar'' units, it appears that facilities
almost never exercise this option. EPA guidance on trial burns states that ``although it is possible to satisfy this
requirement by submitting information showing that a trial burn is not required, this is a rare occurrence *&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Neither of the trial burn contractors that were contacted was aware of a successful ``data in lieu of'' application.
Regional permit writers knew of a few permits that were granted based on the ``data in lieu of'' provision, but in those
cases the units were determined to be identical and, therefore, would still qualify under today's proposal. Thus
it is likely that the main effect of changing the ``data in lieu of'' provision will be to clarify already existing practices,
and to reflect more realistic situations and how EPA currently interprets this provision.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second permitting requirement that may result in a direct cost to the regulated community is the delineation of
the process following a trial burn failure. Today's proposed rule proposes that, following a trial burn failure,
(1) The combustion facility must immediately restrict operation for those conditions that failed the trial burn,
and (2) the combustion facility must either revise the permit application to reflect the new conditions (estimated
cost $5,100), or revise the trial burn plan and rerun the trial burn (estimated cost $110,000 to $550,000). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA estimates that 4% of interim status combustion units (six facilities over the next twenty years) will fail a trial
burn for one or more conditions. Of these, 17% (one facility) is expected to simply revise the permit application and
83% (five facilities) are expected to revise the trial burn plan and rerun the trial burn. Annualized over a ten year
period, discounted at 7%, the resulting annualized national total cost of facility actions that follow a trial burn
failure is $70,000 to $340,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the above costs can be attributed to today's proposed rule, EPA does not expect there to be any true incremental
costs. Currently, if an interim status facility fails a trial burn, the permitting authority can deny the permit.
In addition, based on conversations with EPA Regional permit writers, no permit writer would grant a permit to a facility
that failed the trial burn unless the facility re-ran (and passed) the trial burn or revised the permit conditions.
Thus, the incremental cost of this proposed requirement, when current practices are taken into account, is $0. The
main effect of the delineation of the process that follows trial burn failures would be to clarify current permitting
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the potential annualized total national cost for the permitting section of today's proposed rule is estimated
to be $70,000 to $860,000. The annualized incremental cost, when current practices are taken into account, is estimated
to be between $0 to $520,000. EPA expects that the main effect of the permitting provisions of today's proposed rule
will be to clarify and codify current practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Other effects. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the costs estimated above, the requirement that interim status combustion facilities be subject to
the performance standards of &sect;264.342 (for incinerators) or &sect;266.104 through &sect;266.107 (for BIFs)
upon completion of trial burn has the potential to impose costs due to the restricted operating conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, despite the proposed restriction following trial burn failure, operations at the affected units are not
expected to cease entirely, because the proposed restriction on operations pertains only to the condition(s) that
fail to meet the specifications in the trial burn plan. The unit can continue operations under a modified design and/or
operating conditions that are sufficient to allow the unit to function within the performance standards. In addition,
the restriction lasts only until the trial burn plan is revised and a new trial burn occurs or the permit application
is modified. Therefore, EPA does not expect this provision to significantly disrupt facility operation or impose
significant additional costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Summary of Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The RCRA permitting program was developed to protect human health and the environment from the risks posed by the treatment,
storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. By improving and clarifying the permitting process, today's proposed
rule produces environmental benefits that result from a more efficient permitting process. Below is an explanation
of how each of the provisions of today's rule provides benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Expanded Public Involvement Opportunities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The main benefit of the expanded public participation requirements of today's rule is to provide more opportunities
for the public to become involved early in permitting decisions regarding hazardous waste storage, treatment, and
disposal facilities that may ultimately affect their communities. EPA believes these requirements will allow applicants
and permitting authorities the opportunity to address public concern in making decisions about the facility and
the proposed permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Providing the public with an expanded role in the permit process, by promoting community participation and input
at all decision-making levels, also will help to foster continued community involvement after sites become permitted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, expanding public involvement opportunities should streamline the permitting process, since public
issues will be raised and addressed earlier in the process. Currently, the public does not formally get involved in
the permitting process until the draft permit stage. This stage occurs after the permitting agency and the permit
applicant have discussed crucial parts of the Part B application; thus, the public feels that most major decisions
on the permit have already been made at this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Modification of the Permitting Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One benefit of the permitting provisions of today's rule is to clarify current practices and, therefore, facilitate
the permitting process by making it easier to understand for the public and the regulated community.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, today's proposal moves &sect;270.62(d) and &sect;270.66(g), which address interim status requirements,
to proposed &sect;270.74, where the majority of the interim status provisions are contained. The wording is essentially
the same, clarifying when the facility must submit the trial burn plan and emphasizing that the permitting authority
must approve the trial burn plan before the facility may conduct the trial burn. The new language structure presents
the requirements chronologically and makes the regulation easier to understand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also stating in &sect;270.74(c)(1) that interim status combustion facilities seeking permits must receive
approval of the trial burn plan by the Director before conducting the trial burn. EPA believes that making the requirements
more explicit will ensure that trial burn plans reflect EPA policy and guidance, and that the burns will be adequate
to set permit operating conditions. As discussed in the cost analysis section, EPA is also proposing a revision of
the provision for submitting data in lieu of a trial burn (&sect;270.19 for incinerators and &sect;270.22 for BIFs)
to reflect current practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By specifying that a unit must be ``virtually identical'' to, and at the same facility as, a permitted unit, instead
of ``sufficiently similar'', today's rule will remove any confusion surrounding the interpretation of the ``data
in lieu of'' option and will reflect EPA's current interpretation of this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another aspect of the permitting process that may cause confusion is the fact that, although existing EPA policy allows
the facility to conduct additional trial burns, current regulations do not specifically address permitting procedures
following an interim status facility trial burn failure. Today's proposed rule, by clarifying existing EPA policy,
will help state what actions follow a trial burn failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, today's proposed rule describes in more detail the phases of both shakedown and the trial burn permit modifications
listed under section L.7 of Appendix I, and clarifies how a facility may implement and utilize section 270.42(d) of
the modification procedures. This revision will simplify a facility's compliance with the modification process
by making it easier for a facility to select the appropriate classification for the modification activity.

C. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires Federal agencies to consider ``small entities'' throughout
the regulatory process. Section 603 of the RFA requires an initial screening analysis to be performed to determine
whether small entities will be adversely affected by the regulation. If the analysis identifies affected small entities,
regulatory alternatives must be considered to mitigate the potential impacts. Small entities as described in the
Act are only those ``businesses, organizations and governmental jurisdictions subject to regulation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing the proposed regulations for expanding public involvement in the RCRA permitting process, EPA was
sensitive to the needs and concerns of small businesses. Therefore, the proposed regulations describe the minimum
efforts necessary to fulfill the public involvement requirements. Additional examples of activities facilities
may choose to conduct are provided in the preamble, rather than incorporated into the regulatory language. EPA's
intent in doing so is to provide flexibility for a facility to determine how elaborate it wishes to be in conducting
public involvement activities. In addition, EPA recognizes that, in some situations, an information repository
could become resource intensive for a facility or for the local community. EPA has addressed this concern by providing
discretion to the Director to determine whether to require a repository, rather than requiring it for all facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regards to the burden placed on facilities that burn small quantities of hazardous waste, EPA has already provided
an exemption under section 3004(q)(2)(B) of RCRA. The Agency carefully evaluated the risks posed by small quantity
burning and concluded that a conditional exemption for small quantity burners should be allowed where hazardous
waste combustion poses an insignificant risk. This small quantity burner exemption would therefore reduce the burden
placed on small entities from the revised permitting requirements for hazardous waste combustors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following sub-sections summarize the potential impacts on small entities of three aspects of today's proposed
rule: expanded public participation requirements, revised requirements for ``data in lieu of'' a trial burn, and
requirements following a trial burn failure. In summary, EPA has determined that there are no significant impacts
on small entities from the requirements of this proposed rule.

1. Small Entity Impacts of Expanded Public Participation Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The universe of facilities affected by the public participation requirements include all facilities submitting
a new part B application. In the case of the repository requirement, facilities undergoing permit modification or
closure may also be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determination of which facilities that submit new part B applications might be small entities is somewhat speculative.
Assuming future RCRA facilities will resemble past facilities, approximately 12% of the estimated 53 to 127 new hazardous
waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities may be ``small entities.''
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, 14 of the 159 interim status BIFs are owned by companies that are potentially ``small entities,'' based
on current size thresholds established by the U.S. Small Business Association.

Employment, sales, industry category, and parent company information was obtained from on-line searches of Dun
&amp; Bradstreet and the American Business Directory. In addition to the fourteen BIFs that were identified as potentially
small entities, another four did not have enough information to make a determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned in the cost analysis section, the highest total cost of the public participation requirements is estimated
to be $14,000 per facility. This cost includes setting up an information repository, translating public notices,
and interpreting public meetings. Annualized over ten years at a discount rate of 7%, the cost for a facility, as the
high end of the cost range, would be $1,900 per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This $1,900 per year may have a significant impact on a small entity if it is greater than five percent of the total cost
of production. Thus a facility whose total cost of production is less than $37,000 may be significantly impacted.
It is highly unlikely that the cost of production would be this low for a RCRA hazardous waste facility. Total sales
for ``small entity'' BIFs range from $1.3 million to $87.3 million for the individual facilities and $19.1 million
to $513 million for the parent companies.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Costs of production would presumably be in the same order of magnitude. Thus EPA has determined that there are no significant
impacts on small entities from this provision of the proposed rule and that alternative regulatory approaches are
not necessary.

2. Small Entity Impacts of Revised Requirements for ``Data in Lieu of'' a Trial Burn
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The universe of facilities potentially affected by the revised requirements for ``data in lieu of'' a trial burn include
interim-status BIFs that would have used the ``data in lieu of'' exemption, but because of the revised requirements
of the proposed rule, would now not be allowed to do so. As mentioned above, 14 of the 159 interim status BIFs are owned
by companies that are potentially ``small entities.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned in the cost analysis section, the revised requirements for ``data in lieu of'' a trial burn have a potential
direct incremental cost of $0 to $500,000 per affected facility, or an annualized cost of $0 to $47,000 per facility
(over ten years at 7% discount rate, assuming costs occur in year one). The high end of the cost range would be caused
by trial burn costs that are imposed due to tightening of the ``data in lieu of'' requirement. Because total sales for
``small entity'' BIFs range from $1.3 million to $87.3 million for the individual facilities and $19.1 million to
$513 million for the parent companies,
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 the costs of the ``data in lieu of'' requirement are less than 5% of total sales for any one facility and therefore not
likely to significantly impact small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Furthermore, the ``data in lieu of'' requirement is not a new requirement, but simply a codification of current policy.
Currently, this requirement can only be applied at facilities with multiple units. Such facilities are not likely
to be small entities; therefore a tightening of the ``data in lieu of'' requirement would not affect small entities.
Thus EPA does not expect the revised requirements for ``data in lieu of'' a trial burn to impact small entities.

3. Small Entity Impacts of Requirements Following a Trial Burn Failure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The universe of facilities potentially affected by the requirements following a trial burn failure include interim-status
BIFs that fail their trial burn for one or more condition. As mentioned above, 14 of the 159 interim status BIFs are owned
by companies that are potentially ``small entities.'' As explained in the cost analysis section, EPA does not expect
there to be any major incremental costs to those facilities that fail a trial burn and, therefore, does not expect the
proposed rule requirements to have any significant impacts on small entities.

D. Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12875 on enhancing the intergovernmental partnership charges federal agencies to establish meaningful
consultation and collaboration with State and local governments on matters that affect them. In most cases, State
governments are the level of government that regulates hazardous waste. In developing this proposed rule, therefore,
EPA has consulted with State officials. EPA had five states (representing various parts of the country, e.g., east,
south, center, and west) participate in the workgroup process for this proposed rule. These states reviewed and provided
feedback on the draft proposal over a period of eight months. In addition, these states participated in monthly workgroup
meetings via conference call. Their participation and immediate feedback in the workgroup process added considerable
value to the draft proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA contacted additional states in an effort to receive their specific feedback on general permitting and public
involvement techniques. Additionally, EPA solicited state input during a session of the 3rd Annual RCRA Public Involvement
National Conference, in which 16 state representatives participated. The state participants provided numerous
helpful suggestions and ideas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Agency utilized existing State groups, such as the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste
Management Officials (ASTSWMO), to solicit input on the proposed rule at various stages in the development process.
Also, State personnel at the Commissioner level provided input to EPA at bi-monthly meetings of the EPA-State Task
Force on Hazardous Waste Management. Through early involvement in both vehicles, state representatives made valuable
contributions to the regulatory development process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Prior to the initial submission of a Part B RCRA permit application for a facility, the applicant must hold at least
one meeting with the public in order to solicit questions from the community and inform the community of proposed hazardous
waste management activities in sufficient detail to allow the community to understand the nature of the operations
to be conducted at the facility and the implications for human health and the environment. The applicant shall give
an overview of the facility in as much detail as possible, such as identifying the type of facility, the location of
the facility, the general processes involved, the types of wastes generated and managed, and implementation of waste
minimization and pollution control measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A stenographic or electronic record shall be made of the meeting, along with a list of attendees and their addresses.
The record, list of attendees, and copies of any written comments or materials submitted at the meeting, shall be submitted
as part of the permit application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The applicant must provide public notice of the pre-application meeting at least 30 days prior to the meeting in
a manner that is likely to reach all affected members of the community. The applicant must provide documentation of
this notice in the permit application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Public notice shall be given in the following manner: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or equivalent jurisdiction that
hosts the proposed location of the facility, and in each adjacent county or jurisdiction, if applicable. In situations
where the geographic area of a host jurisdiction or adjacent jurisdictions is very large (hundreds of square miles),
the newspaper notice shall cover a reasonable radius from the facility. The notice must be published as a display advertisement.
The advertisement shall appear in a place within the newspaper calculated to give the general public effective notice;
it must be of sufficient size to be seen easily by the reader. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The applicant must post a notice on a clearly marked sign on the proposed or existing facility property. The sign
should be large enough so that the wording is readable from the facility boundary. It is not necessary to display a map
on the required posted sign on the facility property.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) At any time during the application process for a RCRA permit, the Director may require the applicant to establish
and maintain an information repository. The purpose of this provision is to make accessible to interested persons
documents, reports and other public information developed pursuant to activities required under 40 CFR parts 124,
264, and 270. (See &sect;270.30(l)(12) of this chapter for similar provisions relating to the information repository
during the life of a permit.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The information repository shall contain all documents, reports, data, and other information deemed sufficient
by the Director for public understanding of the plans, activities, and operations of any hazardous waste facility
that is operating or seeking a permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The information repository shall be located and maintained at a location chosen by the facility that is within
reasonable distance of the facility, and within a structure with suitable public access, such as a county library,
courthouse, or local government building. However, if the Director determines the location unsuitable, the Director
may specify a more appropriate location. The repository shall be open to the public during reasonable hours, or accessible
by appointment. The information repository shall be located to provide reasonable access to a photocopy machine
or alternative means for people to obtain copies of documents at reasonable cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Director shall specify requirements for informing the public about the information repository. At a minimum,
the Director shall require the facility to provide a written notice about the information repository to all individuals
on the facility mailing list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Information regarding opportunities and procedures for public involvement, including the opportunity to be
put on the facility mailing list, shall be made available at the repository. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The facility owner/operator shall be responsible for maintaining and updating the repository with appropriate
information throughout a time period specified by the Director, unless existing State regulations require the State
to maintain the information repository.

 The owner or operator may seek a waiver from the trial burn requirements to demonstrate conformance with &sect;&sect;266.104
through 266.107 of this chapter and &sect;270.66 by providing the information required by &sect;270.66 from previous
compliance testing of the device in conformance with &sect;266.103 of this chapter, or from compliance testing or
trial or operational burns of boilers or industrial furnaces with a virtually identical design at the same facility
burning similar hazardous wastes under virtually identical conditions. If data from a virtually identical device
is used to support a trial burn waiver request, the design and operating information required by &sect;270.66 must
be provided for both the virtually identical device and the device to which the data are to be applied, and a comparison
of the design and operating information must be provided. The Director shall approve a permit application without
a trial burn if he finds that the hazardous wastes are sufficiently similar, the devices are virtually identical in
design and at the same facility, the operating conditions are virtually identical, and the data from other compliance
tests, trial burns, or operational burns are adequate to specify (under &sect;266.102 of this chapter) operating
conditions that will ensure conformance with &sect;266.102(c) of this chapter. In addition, the following information

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(D) A schedule of required activities prior to permit issuance, including when the permitting authority is expecting
to give its approval of the plan, and the time periods during which the trial burn would be conducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When a trial burn plan is approved, the Director will specify a time period prior to permit issuance during which
the trial burn must be conducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The applicant shall perform a trial burn in accordance with the approved trial burn plan, and must make the required
determinations, submissions, and certifications in accordance with &sect;&sect;270.62(b)(6) through (b)(9)
for incinerators, or &sect;&sect;270.66(d)(3) through (d)(5), and 270.66(f) for boilers and industrial furnaces.
Trial burn results must be submitted prior to issuance of a draft permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Upon completion of the trial burn, combustion units must comply with the performance standards of &sect;264.343
of this chapter (for incinerators), or &sect;&sect;266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter (for BIFs), along with
all other applicable interim status standards. Compliance shall be demonstrated and determined based on the results
of the trial burn, as follows. The owner or operator may only operate the combustion unit under conditions that passed
and were demonstrated to meet the performance standards, and only if the successful trial burn data is sufficient
to set all applicable operating conditions during the post-trial burn period. If any results of a trial burn for a combustion
unit show non-compliance with any set of performance standards, the owner or operator must immediately cease operating
under the condition(s) that resulted in non-compliance, and notify the Director. In order to continue operating
when results of the trial burn show non-compliance with any performance standards under any set of conditions, the
owner or operator must submit to the Director, with the trial burn results, a description of the conditions under which
it is operating, and a preliminary explanation of how the conditions were determined to be sufficient to ensure that
the unit functions within the performance standards. After reviewing the trial burn data and the preliminary demonstration
submitted by the owner or operator, the Director may further restrict operating conditions as necessary to assure
that the unit is operated within the performance standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If the trial burn results indicate that any performance standards in &sect;264.343 of this chapter for incinerators,
or &sect;&sect;266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter for boilers and industrial furnaces, have not been met, the
facility may submit a request to conduct an additional trial burn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The request to conduct an additional trial burn must include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) An explanation of the reasons for the previous trial burn failure; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A revised trial burn plan submitted under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section which contains substantive changes
to address the reasons for the previous trial burn failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The revised trial burn plan must be approved by the Director according to the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)
through (c)(4) of this section. The Director may approve the request to conduct an additional trial burn only if the
requirements of this section have been satisfactorily met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The Director must send a notice to all persons on the facility mailing list as specified in 40 CFR 124.10(c)(1)(ix)
and to the appropriate units of State and local government as specified in 40 CFR 124.10(c)(1)(x) announcing that
the Director has reviewed the draft revised trial burn plan and has tentatively decided to approve it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) This notice must be given within a reasonable time period, and in accordance with &sect;270.74(c)(3)(A) through
(D). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If the trial burn results indicate that compliance with the performance standards in &sect;264.343 of this chapter
for incinerators, or &sect;&sect;266.104 through 266.107 of this chapter for boilers and industrial furnaces,
was not achieved, and thus, operating conditions cannot be developed under &sect;264.345 of this chapter for incinerators,
or &sect;266.103 of this chapter for boilers and industrial furnaces, the Director may, pursuant to the procedures
in Part 124 of this chapter, deny the permit application for the combustion unit.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) proposes to amend its existing regulations in light
of recently enacted changes to Title V of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), as amended
by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The proposed rules are intended to provide incentives for the remining and reclamation
of lands eligible for expenditures under section 402(g)(4) or 404 of SMCRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The House of Representatives Report from the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs on the Comprehensive National
Energy Policy Act of 1992 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
H.R. Rep.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 474, 102 Cong., 2d Session at 85 (1992)) contains the following statements: ``The [coal remining] provisions of this
section seek to make coal available that otherwise would be bypassed by providing incentives for industry to extract
and reprocess, in an environmentally sound manner, coal that remains in abandoned mine lands and refuse piles. Current
law reclamation performance standards were devised to address surface coal mining on undisturbed lands; the unintended
result is to discourage remining. Remining also serves to mitigate the health, safety, and environmental threats
posed to coalfield residents from abandoned mine lands by augmenting the work done under the Abandoned Mine Reclamation
Program.'' These statements succinctly characterize a basic and long-standing conflict associated with remining.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 24, 1992, the President signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;486, section
2503, Coal Remining, which, in part, amended Sections 510, 515(b)(20), and 701 of SMCRA in order to provide the following
initiatives to encourage remining in an environmentally-sound manner: 1. The revegetation success liability period
for certain remining operations has been reduced to five years in the West and two years in the East; 2. Remined lands
shall remain eligible for Title IV reclamation following bond release; and 3. The permittee of a remining operation
shall not be subject to subsequent permit blocking under Section 510(c) of SMCRA for any violation resulting from
an unanticipated event or condition occurring on the remining site. (Section 510(c) is implemented by 30 CFR 773.15.)

A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regarding the above-mentioned remining amendments to SMCRA which are the subject of this rulemaking, OSM sought
input from environmental groups, industry, and State regulatory authorities concerning the extent to which new
regulations would need to expand or clarify statutory language in order to effectively implement Congressional
intent. Comments received during this outreach have been considered in developing this proposal. Other provisions
in section 2503 of the Energy Policy Act prescribe specific regulatory initiatives regarding the removal or on-site
reprocessing of abandoned coal refuse sites. These initiatives will be implemented under a separate rulemaking.

B. Proposed Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 30 CFR Part 701_Permanent Regulatory Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 701.5, Definitions, is proposed to be amended by adding two terms defined in section 2503(c) of the Energy
Policy Act. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lands eligible for remining
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be defined as in the Energy Policy Act by reference to sections 404 and 402(g)(4) of the SMCRA. Thus, the following
sites would be included under this definition: sites that were mined for coal or affected by mining activities and
abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there is no continuing
reclamation responsibility under State or other Federal laws; coal sites in each State abandoned after August 3,
1977, but before the State received primacy under SMCRA and for which available bond is insufficient to provide for
adequate reclamation; or coal sites where mining was completed between August 4, 1977, and November 5, 1990, and which
remain unreclaimed due to the insolvency of a surety company occurring during that same period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unanticipated event or condition
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is proposes to be defined consistent with the definition contained in the Energy Policy Act to mean an event or condition
at an operation on lands eligible for remining under section 404 or 402(g)(4) of SMCRA that was not contemplated by
the applicable surface coal mining and reclamation permit.

2. 30 CFR Part 773_Requirements for Permits and Permit Processing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM proposes to amend Section 773.15, Review of Permit Applications, in two ways.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new proposed subparagraph (c)(13) would require the regulatory authority to utilize data and analyses provided
under existing permit information rules and proposed &sect;785.25, discussed in the next section, in order to find
that the proposed permit area contains lands eligible for remining and to set a threshold beyond which conditions
or events arising subsequent to permit issuance may be presumed to constitute ``unanticipated events or conditions''
for the purpose of applying the permit-block exclusion of proposed paragraph (f) of &sect;773.15.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulatory authority would evaluate the potential environmental and safety problems and associated analysis
provided by the applicant based on a review of procedures used, supporting data and documentation, and mitigation
plans. After acceptance of the estimates and findings provided by the applicant, the regulatory authority would
set the threshold. The threshold which will be determined on a case-by-case basis is therefore set at permit issuance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM believes the information provided by the applicant under proposed new &sect;785.25, which contains additional
permit requirements tailored specifically to remining problems, is compatible with the development of a threshold.
Two elements of proposed 785.25 are considered to be particularly well suited for this purpose: 1. The permit applicant's
estimate of the maximum impacts associated with each identified potential environmental or safety problem; and
2. the permit applicant's estimate of the probability of each potential environmental or safety problem occurring.
Furthermore, OSM believes that a threshold expressed quantitatively in terms of either or both of these two elements
would provide the clearest guidance for operators, be easier to regulate for the regulatory authorities, and would
minimize subsequent controversy and disputes between the operator and regulatory authority as to what events or
conditions were indeed ``unanticipated''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM is therefore seeking comments on three issues associated with formulating a threshold: 1. Whether either or both
of the two elements described above, or some combination of the two, would provide an appropriate base for such formulation;
2. methods by which the base may be expressed in quantifiable terms; and 3. whether additional guidance is needed for
the regulatory authority in the final rule and what the nature of that guidance should be.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (f) would be added to implement the Energy Policy Act's section 2503(a) mandate for an exclusion
from permit blocking provisions of 510(c) of SMCRA. The proposed rule would waive the permit-block provisions of
paragraph (b) of &sect;773.15 in cases where a violation occurred at a remining site and the violation was attributed
to an unanticipated event or condition. In such cases, the person holding the remining permit would not be rendered
ineligible for a new permit based on the violation. Statutory authority for the permit-block exclusion would expire
on September 30, 2004.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope of the permit-block exclusion of proposed paragraph (f) derives from the statutory term ``violation resulting
from an unanticipated event or condition at a surface coal mining operation.'' The question has arisen whether the
non-payment of delinquent penalties assessed after a notice of violation or a failure-to-abate cessation order
based on an ``on the ground'' violation resulting from an unanticipated event or condition should be covered by the
Energy Policy Act exclusion. Such delinquencies, which are violations, would be covered by the exclusion if they
were construed as ``resulting from an unanticipated event or condition at a surface coal mining operation.'' OSM
is seeking comments on the extent to which such violations should be covered by the exclusion in section 2503(a) of
the Energy Policy Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another question that might arise is whether the operator of a previously undisturbed site would be subject to permit
blocking for an unabated violation on his site which originated from an unanticipated event on a nearby or adjacent
remining operation. Whether or not an event or condition on an adjacent site is a violation is a fact specific inquiry
and depends on whether the surface coal mining operation on the adjacent site caused or contributed to the event or
condition. Therefore, if the operator of the previously undisturbed site contributed to the event or condition which
originated on the remining site and that operator does not abate the violation, the operator of the previously undisturbed
site would be permit blocked. The proposed paragraph (f) exemption for permit blocking only relates to violations
occurring on lands eligible for remining.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM is seeking comments on any other examples of the interplay between remining operations and adjacent surface coal
mining operations that may need to be explained in the final rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. 30 CFR Part 785_Requirements for Permits for Special Categories of Mining
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM proposes to add new &sect;785.25, Lands eligible for remining. (Sections 785.23 and 785.24 are being reserved
for a separate rulemaking.) The permit requirements in proposed section 785.25 for operations on lands eligible
for remining are intended to supplement information requirements in existing rules as they would apply to operations
on lands eligible for remining. The types of new permit information being proposed would be required only to the extent
that they are not provided under existing regulations. For example, provisions related to the determination of probably
hydrologic consequences at &sect;&sect;780.21 and 784.14 of the permanent program regulations require baseline
information on flow and quality of ground water and surface water and an estimate of the impacts of the proposed operation
on these baseline conditions such as findings on: Whether adverse impacts may occur to the hydrologic balance; whether
acid-forming or toxic-forming materials are present that could contaminate surface or ground water supplies; and
whether surface or ground water used for any legitimate purpose in the permit or adjacent area will be contaminated,
diminished or interrupted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permit requirements of &sect;&sect;780.21 and 784.14 were intended to identify and control probable impacts
to hydrology from coal removal associated with the first time disturbance of the land. Hence, they do not in most cases
address the unique environmental or safety problems and impacts that can arise from the redisturbance of abandoned
mine lands. The proposal would fill in this gap by focusing on the identification of: Potential environmental and
safety problems specific to lands eligible for remining; maximum impacts that could result and the probability for
the type of problem to occur; and mitigation measures to meet applicable performance standards. The purpose of these
requirements is to provide the regulatory authority with a sound basis for setting a threshold beyond which conditions
or events arising subsequent to permit issuance may be presumed to be unanticipated at the site. Furthermore, these
requirements will help to ensure that potential environmental and safety problems commonly linked to abandoned
mine land sites are not overlooked at the permitting stage and, thus, inadvertently contribute to the occurrence
of unanticipated events or conditions which might result in more severe environmental or safety problems from the
remining operation than may currently exist at the site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, OSM believes it is essential that all reasonable evaluations be conducted in order to identify the probability
for serious environmental or safety problems to occur. While there are potential economic and environmental benefits
to be gained through remining, there also exists the potential for significant environmental degradation and safety
problems. For example, if a remining operation unintentionally caused a sudden discharge of water or blowout from
an adjacent water-filled abandoned mine, significant quantities of acid mine discharge could be released and create
severe ecological harm in the receiving streams. It is important, therefore, in granting remining permits that the
applicant identify the potential environmental and safety problems associated with the site, maximum impacts associated
with these problems, and the probability for each type of problem to occur. These categories of information will assist
the regulatory authority in setting a threshold beyond which conditions or events arising subsequent to permit issuance
may be presumed to constitute unanticipated events or conditions. In order to provide a permit applicant for a remining
operation some certainty regarding the potential scope of the 510(c) permit-blocking provision, the applicant
shall be expected to provide all required information related to the potential environmental and safety problems
of the remining site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM recognizes the difficulty of accurately predicting certain impacts such as acid mine drainage even on the basis
of extensive baseline information. OSM is therefore soliciting comments on other specific information needed to
be provided by the applicant that will be useful in developing a threshold for unanticipated events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM is also requesting estimates on the number of hours to develop the information required by &sect;785.25 and is
seeking suggestions on efficient and effective ways to develop this information and present it in the permit application.

OSM is proposing to amend subparagraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of section 816.116, Revegetation: Standards for Success.
The change at (c)(2) would reduce the period of applicant responsibility for revegetation success at sites eligible
for remining from five to two years in areas of more than 26.0 inches of average annual precipitation and for these sites
provide that vegetative parameters for grazing land, pasture land, or cropland shall equal or exceed the approved
success standard during the growing season of any two years of the responsibility period. The change at (c)(3) would
reduce the applicant responsibility for revegetation success from ten to five years in areas of 26.0 inches or less
of annual average precipitation. The authority for these changes would expire on September 30, 2004.

This proposed rule has been reviewed under the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778,
Civil Justice Reform (56 FR 55195). In general, the requirements of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778 are covered
by the preamble discussion of this proposed rule. Additional remarks follow concerning individual elements of the
Executive Order:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. What is the preemptive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To retain primacy, States have to adopt and apply standards for their regulatory programs that are no less effective
than those set forth in OSM's regulations. Any State law that is inconsistent with or that would preclude implementation
of the proposed regulation would be subject to preemption under section 505 of SMCRA and its implementing regulations
at 30 CFR 730.11.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 505(b) of that act provides that any provision of State law which provides for more stringent land use and environmental
controls and regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations than do the provisions of SMCRA or any regulations
issued pursuant thereto shall not be construed to be inconsistent with SMCRA. Therefore, to the extent that the proposed
regulation would provide less stringent land use and environmental controls than presently contained in State law,
the proposed regulation would not preempt the State provisions and would not necessitate changes to approved State
programs. A more definitive answer to this question will depend on the provisions of any final rule adopted in this
rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. What is the effect on existing Federal law or regulation, if any, including all provisions repealed or modified?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule modifies the implementation of SMCRA, as described herein, and is not intended to modify the implementation
of any other Federal statute. The preceding discussion of this proposed rule specifies the Federal regulatory provisions
that are affected by this proposed revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Does the rule provide a clear and certain legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard, while
promoting simplification and burden reduction?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards established by this rule are as clear and certain as practicable, given the complexity of the topics
covered and the mandates of SMCRA. The purpose of this proposed rule is to establish clear and certain standards in
order to implement a more effective program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. What is the retroactive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Are administrative proceedings required before parties may file suit in court? Which proceedings apply? Is the
exhaustion of administrative remedies required?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No administrative proceedings are required before parties may file suit in court challenging the provisions of this
proposed rule under section 526(a) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1276(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to any judicial challenge to the application of the rule, however, administrative procedures must be exhausted.
In situations involving OSM application of the rule, applicable administrative procedures may be found at 43 CFR
part 4. In situations involving State regulatory authority application of provisions equivalent to those contained
in this proposed rule, applicable administrative procedures are set forth in the particular State program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Does the rule define key terms, either explicitly or by reference to other regulations or statutes that explicitly
define those items?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Terms which are important to the understanding of this proposed rule are set forth in 30 CFR 700.5, 701.5, 773.15 and
785.23. New definitions are located in section 701.5.

G. Does the rule address other important issues affecting clarity and general draftsmanship of regulations set forth
by the Attorney General, with the concurrence of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, that are determined
to be in accordance with the purposes of the Executive Order? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General and the Director of the Office Management and Budget have not issued any guidance on this requirement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

et, seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This
determination is based on the findings that the regulatory additions is the rule will not change costs to industry
or to the Federal, State, or local governments. Furthermore, the rule produces no adverse effects on competition,
employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of the United States enterprises to compete with
foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM has prepared a draft environmental assessment (EA) of this proposed rule and has made a tentative finding that
it would not significantly affect the quality of the human environment under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C). It is anticipated that a finding of no significant impact (FONSI)
will be made for the final rule in accordance with OSM procedures under NEPA. The EA is on file in the OSM Administrative
Record at the address specified previously (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The EA will be completed and a finding made on the significance of any resulting impacts prior to promulgation of
the final rule.
