SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Bovine tuberculosis is the contagious, infectious, and communicable disease caused by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mycobacterium bovis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The tuberculosis regulations, contained in 9 CFR part 77 (referred to below as the regulations), regulate the interstate
movement of cattle and bison because of tuberculosis. Cattle or bison not known to be affected with or exposed to tuberculosis
are eligible for interstate movement without restriction if those cattle or bison are moved from jurisdictions designated
as accredited-free States or modified accredited States. The regulations restrict the interstate movement of cattle
or bison not known to be affected with or exposed to tuberculosis if those cattle or bison are moved from jurisdictions
designated as nonmodified accredited States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The status of a State is based on its freedom from evidence of tuberculosis, the effectiveness of the State's tuberculosis
eradication program, and the degree of the State's compliance with the standards contained in the ``Uniform Methods
and Rules_Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication,'' which is part of the regulations via incorporation by reference in
part 77. A State must have no findings of tuberculosis in any cattle or bison in the State for at least 5 years in order
to be designated as an accredited-free State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before publication of this interim rule, New York was designated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;77.1 of the regulations as a modified accredited State. However, New York now meets the requirements for designation
as an accredited-free State. Therefore, we are amending the regulations by removing New York from the list of modified
accredited States in &sect;77.1 and adding it to the list of accredited-free States in that section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Immediate Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is warranted, as New York currently
meets the criteria for designation as an accredited-free State. This action provides prospective cattle and bison
buyers with accurate and up-to-date information, which may affect the marketability of cattle and bison since some
prospective buyers prefer to buy cattle and bison from accredited-free States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

comments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 21,000 cattle herds in New York, with a total of about 1,560,000 cattle. An estimated 90 percent
of these herds are owned by small entities. Changing the status of New York may affect the marketability of cattle and
bison from the State, since some prospective cattle and bison buyers prefer to buy cattle and bison from accredited-free
States. This may result in some beneficial economic impact on some small entities. However, based on our experience
in similar designations of other States, the impact should not be significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 92 (referred to below as the regulations) prohibit or restrict the importation into the
United States of certain animals and birds to prevent the introduction of communicable livestock and poultry diseases,
including bovine tuberculosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bovine tuberculosis is a serious communicable disease of cattle, bison, and other species, including humans, caused
by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mycobacterium bovis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Bovine tuberculosis (referred to below as TB) causes weight loss, general debilitation, and sometimes death. This
disease manifests itself as lung disease or draining, nonhealing abscesses, or both. It is generally transmitted
by breathing in respiratory excretions from infected animals or drinking infected milk from infected animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New Zealand has reported that TB is endemic in the brushtail possum (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Trichosurus vulpecula
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These possums are a constant source of disease for the domestic livestock population of New Zealand. Based upon
information received from the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and information available in scientific
literature, we recently prepared a risk assessment regarding the importation of brushtail possums from New Zealand
into the United States. This risk assessment indicates that 45.8 percent (range 7.2 percent to 67.4 percent) of consignments
of imported brushtail possums (generally imported in 4 consignments of 12 animals each) would contain 1 or more possums
infected with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mycobacterium bovis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Additionally, there is no recognized test for detecting TB in brushtail possums. These factors present a significant
risk that TB-infected brushtail possums from New Zealand could be imported into the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because hedgehogs from New Zealand occupy the same habitat and geographical areas as the brushtail possums, there
is some risk that hedgehogs could contract TB from TB-infected possums. Also, as with the brushtail possums, there
is no recognized test for detecting TB in hedgehogs. These factors present an unacceptable risk that TB-infected
hedgehogs from New Zealand could be imported into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There have been a number of importations of brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand into the United States.
Both these animals could likely survive and thrive in the wild in much of the United States. If infected with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mycobacterium bovis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and allowed to roam freely, these animals could disseminate the TB organism over range and pasture land. Consuming
grass contaminated with the TB organism by TB-infected brushtail possums is the major mode of TB infection in cattle
in New Zealand. To prevent a similar situation in the United States, we are amending the regulations by adding a new
subpart G to prohibit the importation of brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand into the United States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary to prevent the introduction
of TB into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon signature.
We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule prohibits the importation of brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand into the United States. These
animals are imported as pets, for animal exhibitions, and for petting zoos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulating the importation of certain animals that pose a disease risk to livestock in the United States is a continuing
program. Discontinuing the importation of brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand will have no significant
cost impacts, but it will produce a benefit by helping to protect domestic livestock from this disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incidence of TB in domestic cattle remains relatively small; however, it has increased slightly in the past several
years. Most of the incidences have occurred in States that share a border with Mexico. Mexican-origin cattle accounted
for 83 percent of all TB lesions disclosed at slaughter in 1992. There are very few cases of TB in the rest of the country.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inventory of all cattle and calves in the United States is estimated at 101.7 million head, with an estimated value
of almost $67 billion. Nationwide, there are approximately 1.2 million operations with cattle and calves, according
to USDA data.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The economic impact on the domestic cattle industry if TB-infected brushtail possums and hedgehogs from New Zealand
were imported into the United States would be severe. The annual costs in New Zealand for possum damage (for example,
damage to the environment and bovine TB attributable to the brushtail possum), disease surveillance, control and
research probably exceed $20 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Fish and Wildlife Service, there are probably two known importers of brushtail possums and hedgehogs
from New Zealand. These importers would be considered small entities under the Small Business Administration criteria.
Although the Fish and Wildlife Service could not provide data on the actual number of imported brushtail possums and
hedgehogs imported from New Zealand into the United States by these importers, the Service has stated that these animals
represent a very small percent of the total number of animals imported into the United States by these importers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is amending its regulations to provide that persons requesting a hearing in certain
materials license proceedings must file their requests within 30 days of receiving actual notice of the pendency
of the license application, or, if the person does not learn about the application until it has been granted, within
30 days of receiving actual notice of the grant of the application. No hearing requests filed more than 180 days after
the grant of the application will be entertained. The amendment applies only to materials licensing actions which
are not of sufficient importance to warrant notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The rule change eliminates an ambiguous provision in the Commission's current regulations and serves to ensure
that hearing requests are filed as promptly as possible, in order to promote the timely identification and resolution
of problems with or objections to proposed licensing actions.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's rules governing informal hearing procedures of adjudications on materials licenses are set forth
in subpart L to part 2. When the rules do not require the Commission to publish notice of all proposed licensing actions,
the requirements for requesting a hearing are tied to the date on which a requester receives actual notice of such actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to this rule change, the regulation stated that if 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of an action is not published, then a request for a hearing must be filed within ``the earlier of_(i) Thirty (30)
days after the requestor receives actual notice of a pending application or an agency action granting an application;
or (ii) One hundred and eighty (180) days after agency action granting an application.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August, 1992, the presiding officer in a materials licensing proceeding was faced with a case in which a requester
with actual notice of a license application filed in 1989 waited to ask for a hearing until the NRC granted the application,
three and a half years later. The licensee and the NRC staff objected that the request should have been filed within
30 days of the requester's receiving actual notice of the application. (In other words, they were arguing that the
rule was meant to allow persons to file within 30 days of receiving actual notice of the grant of an application only
if they were unaware until then of the pendency of the application.) The requester responded that the regulation contained
no such implicit condition, and instead gave requesters a choice: Either they could file within 30 days of receiving
actual notice of the application, or they could wait until the grant of the application and then file within 30 days
of learning of the agency's action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The presiding officer sustained the requester's position. He observed that the NRC staff and the licensee were in
effect arguing that the regulation should be read as though it required the request to be filed at the earliest of three
events: 30 days after receipt of actual notice of the filing of the application; 30 days after receipt of actual notice
of the grant of the application; and 180 days after the grant of the application. He added that the Statement of Considerations
accompanying the rule had referred to requests for hearing being timely if filed within 30 days of a requester's receiving
actual notice ``of a licensing action.'' The presiding officer offered a possible rationale for the two separate
windows of opportunity: a potential requester, hopeful that an application might not be approved, would not have
to file a hearing request until the grant of the application eliminated doubt as to the NRC's intent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission did not disturb the presiding officer's ruling, but it directed the staff to prepare a proposed rule
that would make clear that requesters are indeed required to file at the earliest of the three events described above.
Such a notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Analysis of Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments were received on the proposed rule, but neither one was directed to the actual subject of the rulemaking,
i.e., whether the NRC should continue to allow someone with actual knowledge of an application to wait for that application
to be granted before requesting a hearing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first comment, from Kerr-McGee Corporation, endorsed the proposed rule, but noted that the new language ``seemingly
leaves the door open for filing of requests for hearing almost at will.'' Kerr-McGee asserted that the rule is hinged
on when the requester ``receives actual notice,'' an ``ambiguous'' term that ``is not related to the time an actual
amendment application is filed.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The response to this comment is that the NRC's proposed rule was directed to a specific and narrow issue_whether a potential
requester with actual notice of an application should be able to delay filing a hearing request until the application
is granted. The notice did not contemplate revising the rule to change the concept of making the receipt of actual notice
the basis of the time for filing a hearing request.

2. Comment of Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy (OCRE) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second comment was from Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy (OCRE), which objected to the portion of the regulation
that bars petitions filed more than 180 days after the NRC's grant of an application. OCRE asserted that it was conceivable
that someone would not learn of a licensing action until after the passage of 180 days, and would by then, through no
fault of his or her own, have lost all opportunity to request a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCRE's point, like Kerr-McGee's, goes beyond the scope of the quite narrow change that the NRC proposed. The Commission's
notice made clear that the issue to be resolved was whether potential requesters with actual notice of an application
for a particular licensing action were intended to have two bites at the apple, or should instead be required to file
for a hearing at their earliest opportunity. The concept of a 180-day cutoff was never identified as being subject
to reconsideration by the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having considered the comments received, and finding that neither of them suggests a flaw in the specific correction
proposed in the rule, the Commission has determined that the following final rule should be promulgated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that this regulation is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1).
Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this
final rule.

As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule sets forth the time frame
within which a person other than an applicant must file a request for a hearing in a licensing proceeding held under
the informal procedures set forth in 10 CFR part 2, subpart L. The rule does not impose any obligations on regulated
entities that may fall within the definition of ``small entities'' as set forth in section 601(3) of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, or within the definition of ``small business'' as found in section 3 of the Small Business Act, 15
U.S.C. 632, or within the small business size standards contained in 13 CFR part 121.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 3, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Texarkana, AR, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 63903). Controlled airspace to the surface is needed during the hours that the control tower is closed. The proposal
was to establish Class E airspace to contain IFR operations during the hours that the control tower is closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. Other than editorial changes, this amendment is adopted as proposed.
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as
surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1994). The Class E airspace
designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Texarkana, AR. Controlled
airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations during the hours that the control tower is closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action establishes Class E airspace at Somerville, Tennessee. A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) Runway 18 Standard
Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) for the Fayette County Airport has recently been developed. Controlled airspace
extending upward from 700 feet above the surface of the earth is needed to contain Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) operations
at the airport. The operating status of the airport will change from Visual Flight Rule (VFR) to include IFR operations
concurrent with publication of the SIAP. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for
pilots.

On March 31, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Somerville, Tennessee. A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) Runway 18 Standard Instrument Approach
Procedure (SIAP) was developed for the Fayette County Airport at Somerville, Tennessee (59 FR 15136). The proposal
was to add controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain IFR operations in controlled
airspace and to change the operating status of the airport from VFR operations to include IFR operations concurrent
with the publication of the SIAP. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by
submitting written comments on the proposal to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). No comments objecting
to the proposal were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. This amendment is the same as that proposed
in the notice. Designations for Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993. The Class E airspace designation
listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations established Class E airspace at Somerville, Tennessee,
to provide controlled airspace from 700 feet above the surface for aircraft executing an NDB SIAP into the Fayette
County Airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is updating and clarifying its regulations relating to
public use of records and donated historical materials that have been transferred to NARA. Most of the changes in this
regulation merely clarify existing practices and will have no significant impact upon the public. Changes in research
room rules, such as requiring a picture identification when applying for a research card and prohibiting ink pens
and chewing gum in rooms where original records are present, are intended to provide greater protection for the historically
valuable holdings of NARA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in its proposed rule published on October 22, 1993 (58 FR 54540), NARA is making some minimal changes in research
room rules. We received three comments to these proposed rule changes. The three comments were received from customers
who use the regional archives. Since many researchers in the regions travel long distances, they felt the proposed
3-hour limit and ``first come first served'' policy for use of microfilm readers would create a ``hardship'' to their
research. Currently, some regional archives allow reservations of microfilm readers and impose time limits on use
that reflect local demand for the equipment. NARA is amending this rule to give the regional archive directors the
discretion to modify this new rule in a way that benefits the users of their facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;1254.26, we have made two additional nonsubstantive changes. We updated the title, Reference Services
Branch Chief, to reflect a reorganization of the unit responsible for the research rooms. The revised title is Director,
User Services Division. We have also clarified the procedure in &sect;1254.26(a) concerning permission for research
privileges for students under the age of 16 to state explicitly that prospective student researchers are encouraged
to contact the National Archives in advance of their visit to determine their eligibility to do research. This reminder
should particularly assist out-of-town and foreign students in making their research plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since all the records from the Pickett Street facility have moved to the new NARA facility in College Park, Maryland
(National Archives at College Park), all references to the Pickett Street facility have been changed to National
Archives at College Park. In addition, a reference has been added to self-service copiers in National Archives at
College Park for the records transferred from the National Archives Building and the Washington National Records
Center. Because this change affects only the location of records, and not any conditions on their use, and because
the location of the records was the subject of a separate rule making upon which public comment was invited (59 FR 6899),
these changes are being made final without prior notice of proposed rule making. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule contains two information collections, application for researcher identification cards and request
to microfilm records, for which OMB approval has been received. This is not a significant regulation under Executive
Order 12866 and has not been reviewed by OMB. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified
that this rule will not have a significant impact on small entities.

(a) The research room attendant may limit the quantity of documents delivered to a researcher at one time. The researcher
must sign for the documents received and may be required to show his/her researcher identification card. The researcher
is responsible for the proper handling of and prevention of damage to all documents delivered to him/her until he/she
returns them. When the researcher is finished using the documents, the documents must be returned to the research
room attendant. The reference service slip that accompanies the documents to the research room must not be removed.
If asked to do so, the researcher must return documents as much as 15 minutes before closing time. Before leaving a research
room, even for a short time, a researcher must notify the research room attendant and place all documents in their proper
containers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When microfilm is available on a self-service basis, research room attendants will assist researchers in identifying
research sources on microfilm and provide information concerning how to locate and retrieve the roll(s) of film containing
the information of interest. The researcher is responsible for retrieving and examining the roll(s). Unless a researcher
requires assistance in learning how to operate microfilm reading equipment, the researcher is expected to install
the microfilm on the reader. Unless otherwise permitted, a researcher is limited to one roll of microfilm at a time.
After using each roll, the researcher is responsible for refiling the roll of microfilm in the location from which
it was removed, unless instructed otherwise.

(a) Admission to research rooms in the National Archives Building, the Washington National Records Center, and the
National Archives at College Park facility at which original documents are made available is limited to individuals
examining and/or copying documents and other materials in the custody of the National Archives and Records Administration.
Children under the age of 16 will not be admitted to these research rooms unless they have been granted research privileges
or are granted an exception to this provision to view specific documents that a parent or other accompanying adult
researcher is using. The exception will be granted by the Director of the User Services Division for a child who is able
to read and who will be closely supervised by the adult researcher while in the research room. Normally, such a child
will be admitted only for the short period required to view the documents. Unless otherwise permitted, children under
the age of 16 who have been granted special permission to accompany an adult using records may not actively participate
in research activities, e.g., removing, copying, or refiling documents. Students under the age of 16 who wish to perform
research on original documents must apply in person to the Director of the User Services Division and present a letter
of reference from a teacher. Such students may contact the National Archives by phone or letter in advance of their
visit to discuss their eligibility for research privileges. Students under the age of 16 who have been granted research
privileges will be required to be accompanied in the research room by an adult with similar privileges, unless the
Director of the User Services Division specifically waives this requirement with respect to individual researchers.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 31, 1992, the EPA proposed standards to regulate the emissions of certain organic hazardous air pollutants
from synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry (SOCMI) production processes and seven other processes
which are part of major sources under section 112 of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (the Act). This rulemaking is
commonly called the Hazardous Organic NESHAP or the HON. In the final action regarding the December 31, 1992 proposal,
which was signed on February 28, 1994, and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 22, 1994, EPA deferred taking final action regarding provisions applicable to medium storage vessels due
to the need to resolve an issue of statutory interpretation of section 112(d)(3)(A) of the Act. On March 9, 1994, EPA
reopened the comment period to request additional comment on the appropriate interpretation of this statutory provision
and the effect of that interpretation on the appropriate control requirements for medium storage vessels at facilities
subject to the HON.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action announces EPA's final decision regarding the interpretation of Clean Air Act section 112(d)(3)(A) for
purposes of the HON and the final decision regarding control provisions applicable to medium storage vessels in SOCMI
facilities subject to the HON. The decision announced in this action regarding the interpretation of Clean Air Act
section 112(d)(3)(A) for purposes of the HON will be presumptively followed in subsequent MACT rulemakings, but
it will not be binding. Although EPA believes that Congress intended one interpretation_referred to as the ``Higher
Floor Interpretation''_in Clean Air Act section 112(d)(3)(A), EPA also believes that the Agency retains discretion
in important respects in setting Floors for MACT standards. EPA intends to exercise its discretion, within the statutory
framework, to promulgate MACT standards that best serve the public interest.

Public Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately 55 comment letters were received in response to the March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11018) reopening of the comment
period. The majority of these letters were from industries or industrial trade associations, arguing in favor of
the less stringent ``Lower Floor Interpretation.'' Environmental groups, State or local governments and labor
unions argued almost uniformly in favor of the more stringent ``Higher Floor Interpretation.'' The EPA considered
all public comments in framing the final policy for MACT floor determination and in selection of the requirements
for medium storage vessels. The major issues raised by the comments are addressed in this preamble. The EPA's responses
to all the comments can be found in docket A&hyph;90&hyph;19, Subcategory VI&hyph;B.

This section describes EPA's decision with respect to the interpretation of Clean Air Act section 112(d)(3)(A) for
purposes of this rulemaking. As set forth in more detail below, EPA believes that one of the interpretations of section
112(d)(3)(A)_referred to as the ``Higher Floor Interpretation''_is the better and more natural reading of the statutory
language.

Section 112(d)(3) of the Clean Air Act provides that Emissions standards promulgated under this subsection for existing
sources *&blank;*&blank;* shall not be less stringent *&blank;*&blank;* than_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

that have recently achieved LAER are excluded from consideration. Id. (For categories or subcategories with fewer
than 30 sources, standards may not be less stringent than ``the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing
5 sources.'' CAA section 112(d)(3)(B)). The minimum level of stringency defined by this language has come to be known
as the MACT Floor.

, EPA published a notice soliciting comment on ``the appropriate interpretation of'' section 112(d)(3)(A). Two
interpretations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 112(d)(3)(A) were discussed. Under the first, referred to as the ``Higher Floor Interpretation,'' EPA would
look at emission limitations achieved by each of the best performing 12 percent of existing sources, and average those
limitations. ``Average'' would be interpreted to mean a measure of central tendency such as the arithmetic mean or
median. (The arithmetic mean of a set of measurements is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements
in the set. The median is the value in a set of measurements below and above which there are an equal number of values,
when the measurements are arranged in order of magnitude). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the second, ``Lower Floor Interpretation,'' EPA would look at the average emission limits achieved by each
of the best performing 12 percent of existing sources, and take the lowest. This second interpretation groups the
words ``average emission limitation'' into a single phrase, and asks what ``average emission limitation'' (accounting
for variability over time, or between different pollutants being emitted from a facility) is ``achieved by'' all
members of the best performing 12 percent.

B. EPA's Interpretation of Section 112(d)(3)(A) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA believes that the ``Higher Floor Interpretation'' is a better reading of Clean Air Act section 112(d)(3)(A)
than the ``Lower Floor Interpretation.'' This conclusion is based on a review of the statute, legislative history
and comments received in response to EPA's March 9 notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Statutory Language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112(d)(3)(A) requires that standards be no less stringent than ``*&blank;*&blank;* the average emission
limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources *&blank;*&blank;*''. The EPA believes
that the most natural and straightforward reading of this language would have EPA first determine the emission limitations
achieved by sources within the best performing 12 percent, and then average those limitations. This is the method
described above as the ``Higher Floor Interpretation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA believes that if Congress had intended the Lower Floor Interpretation, language other than that actually
used in section 112(d)(3)(A) would have been far more natural. For example, Congress could easily have expressed
the Lower Floor Interpretation by requiring standards to be no less stringent than ``the emission limitation achieved
by all sources within the best performing 12 percent.'' Similarly, Congress could have required standards to be no
less stringent than ``the average emission limitation achieved by the worst performing member of the best performing
12 percent,'' or ``the emission limitation (averaged over time to take account of variability in the effectiveness
of control) achieved by all sources within the best performing 12 percent.'' Any of such phrases would have been a more
natural way to convey the Lower Floor Interpretation than the language Congress chose. However, the actual language
of section 112(d)(3)(A) provides, in straightforward fashion, that standards may be no less stringent than the ``average
emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent *&blank;*&blank;*''. To glean the Lower Floor Interpretation
from this language is a strain; words and concepts not set forth in the statute must be added or inferred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language of section 112(d)(3)(B) makes this point even clearer. That section requires that standards for existing
sources in categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 sources be no less stringent than

42 U.S.C. 7412(d)(3)(B). If an interpretation parallel to the Lower Floor Interpretation were intended, it would
have been more natural for this provision to read ``the emission limitation achieved by the 5th best performing source.''

2. The Legislative History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislative history lends strong support to the view that, in passing section 112(d)(3)(A), Congress intended
the Higher Floor Interpretation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the House side, the language that would eventually become section 112(d)(3)(A) was offered as a compromise amendment
by Rep. Dingell on the House Floor on May 23, 1990. (The language of the amendment was identical to section 112(d)(3)(A)
as ultimately enacted into law; only the numbers were different). Rep. Dingell yielded time to Rep. Collins ``for
purposes of explaining the amendment.'' Legislative History of 1990 CAA Amendments at 2896. In doing so, Rep. Collins
noted that she had originally supported slightly more stringent numbers than those included in the amendment, and
that under her original proposal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The average of emissions from the 10 percent cleanest sources would be the MACT standard. In cases where there are less
than 30 sources in a category or subcategory, the average of the 3 cleanest sources would determine the standard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Id
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. She went on to explain that under the compromise amendment introduced by Rep. Dingell
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
MACT for existing stationary sources would be the average of the best 15 [percent] of technologies within each category
or subcategory. For categories or subcategories where there are less than 30 sources, the standard is based on the
average emissions from the best performing 5 sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Legislative History of 1990 CAA Amendments at 2897. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rep. Collins' formulations are consistent with the Higher Floor Interpretation, not the Lower. The ``average of
the 3 cleanest sources'' cannot mean, as the Lower Floor Interpretation would require, the level of control achieved
by all three of the ``cleanest sources.'' Nor can the ``average of the best 15 [percent] of technologies'' mean a technology
as good as that used by all sources within the top 15 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another discussion of section 112(d)(3) is similar. On October 27, 1990, Sen. Durenberger (a principal supporter
of the Clean Air Act Amendments) explained the provision on the Senate floor. His explanation was as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The standard may not be less stringent than the average of the emission levels achieved by the best performing 12 percent
of the existing sources within the category*&blank;*&blank;* The Administrator is to exclude from the calculation
of the average of top 12 percent any source which met the following conditions*&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Legislative History of 1990 CAA Amendments at 870 (Cong. Rec. S16929_Oct. 27, 1990). The second sentence of Sen. Durenberger's
statement, in particular, is inconsistent with the Lower Floor Interpretation. Sen. Durenberger makes clear that
the ``average'' called for in the statute is of the ``top 12 percent,'' not the emission limitations achieved over
time at each individual source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No legislative history was found that supports the Lower Floor Interpretation. The EPA believes that the legislative
history indicates that individual legislators_including those central to the drafting of section 112(d)(3)_understood
the word ``average'' to mean that once the emission limitations achieved by the best performers in a category had been
determined, those results should be averaged. This is the method of the Higher Floor Interpretation, not the Lower.

(i) Plain Meaning of the Statute. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters argued that the meaning of the statute was plain on its face and that Congress clearly intended
the Higher Floor Interpretation. These commenters argued that when section 112(d)(3)(A) is read as a whole in its
most natural way, the Congressional intent in favor of the Higher Floor Interpretation is clear. They argued that
if Congress had intended the Lower Floor Interpretation, it would have used different language in the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA agrees with these comments. As set forth in greater detail above, EPA believes the plain statutory language
strongly favors the Higher Floor Interpretation.

Congress' Failure to Use the Words ``of the''. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters argued that if Congress had meant the Higher Floor Interpretation, it would have added the words
``of the'' to the statute, so that section 112(d)(3)(A) would read ``the average 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
of the
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission limitations achieved by the best performing 12 percent.'' These commenters saw the absence of the words
``of the'' in the statute as evidence that Congress intended the Lower Floor Interpretation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA agrees that the statute would be more clear if Congress had used the words ``of the,'' but disagrees with the
conclusion drawn by these commenters for two reasons. First, standard English usage often permits dropping the prepositions
``of the'' without changing the meaning of a phrase. (For example, ``the biggest mountain in North America'' has the
same meaning as ``the biggest of the mountains in North America.'' ``Best singer in the band'' has the same meaning
as ``best of the singers in the band.'') The same cannot be said, however, for the various phrases and concepts that
must be read into section 112(d)(3)(A) in order to arrive at the Lower Floor Interpretation. Phrases like ``the worst
performing member of...'' or ``averaged over time...'' simply are not dropped as part of standard English. Their
absence from section 112(d)(3)(A)_unlike the absence of the words ``of the''_must be considered significant in
interpreting the provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, although the words ``of the'' do not appear in section 112(d)(3)(A), they were used by key legislators in summarizing
that section prior to passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. As noted above, when Sen. Durenberger (a principal
supporter of the Clean Air Act Amendments) spoke on the Senate floor on October 27, 1990, he explained section 112(d)(3)(A)
as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Legislative History of 1990 CAA Amendments at 870 (Cong. Rec. S16929_Oct. 27, 1990) (emphasis added). As also noted
above, when Rep. Collins introduced the provision in the House, she described it as follows:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The average of emissions from the 10 percent cleanest sources would be the MACT standard. In cases where there are less
than 30 sources in a category or subcategory, the average 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
of the
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 3 cleanest sources would determine the standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In EPA's view, the fact that Congress did not use the words ``of the'' in section 112(d)(3)(A) is fully consistent with
standard English. However, the fact that key legislators did use these words in describing the provision to their
colleagues, in combination with the failure of those legislators to use the phrases on which the Lower Floor Interpretation
depends, provides a strong indication that Congress intended the Higher Floor Interpretation in enacting section
112(d)(3)(A).

(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose of the Word ``Average''. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters argued that the word ``average'' in section 112(d)(3)(A) should be read to require averaging
not of emissions from different sources within the top 12 percent, but instead of emissions from individual sources
at different times, or from different emission points, or made up of different HAP. The EPA does not agree that the word
``average'' in section 112(d)(3)(A) can reasonably be read to serve this purpose. First, such a reading is difficult,
if not impossible, to reconcile with the provision of section 112(d)(3) establishing a ``floor'' for new sources.
Under those provisions, new source standards may not be less stringent than
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
42 U.S.C. 7412(d)(3). Notably, Congress did not use the word ``average'' in this provision. If the word ``average''
in section 112(d)(3)(A) was intended to refer to averages across time, or between emission points, or among different
HAP, then Congress must have intended that such averaging would take place for existing source standards, but not
for new source standards. There is no reason to believe Congress intended this implausible result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is a much more likely explanation: That to the extent Congress contemplated that averaging across time, or between
emission points, or among HAP would play a role in either existing or new source MACT standards, it considered the terms
``emission limitation'' and ``emission control'' fully adequate to reflect that fact. In EPA's air program, emission
limitations have routinely been expressed in terms of averages across time, for example, without any special statutory
direction or authority. There is no reason to believe that Congress would have thought that special instructions
were needed to ensure that EPA continued this practice, and even less reason to believe Congress would have thought
special instructions were needed with respect to existing source standards, but not new source standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the legislative history of section 112 casts doubt on the interpretation of the word ``average'' offered
by these commenters. When Congress comprehensively revised section 112 in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, it
based the revisions in substantial part on the Clean Water Act's effluent guidelines program. (See, e.g., Remarks
of Sen. Durenberger, Cong. Rec. S516 (January 30, 1990) (``*&blank;*&blank;* this approach to regulation of toxic
air pollutants is not without precedent. A program very similar to the one I have just described has already been implemented
under the Clean Water Act'').) Under that program, certain limits (known as ``BPT limits'') have long been based on
the ``average of the best'' performance at existing facilities. (See generally Remarks of Sen. Muskie, Legislative
History of Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 at 169&hyph;70 (``The Administrator should establish the
range of `best practicable' levels based upon the average of the best existing performance by plants of various sizes,
ages and unit processes.'')) In determining ``average of the best'' under the Clean Water Act, EPA has historically
identified the best performers in an industrial category, and then averaged their performances. This methodology
is consistent with the Higher Floor Interpretation and not the Lower.

(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proximity of the Word ``Average'' to the Words ``Emission Limitation''. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters argued that the proximity of the word ``average'' to the words ``emission limitation'' suggests
that ``average'' modifies ``emission limitation,'' and not the entire phrase following those words. The EPA does
not agree with this argument. In English, adjectives often modify not only the noun immediately following, but an
entire phrase. In the phrase ``the biggest mountain in North America climbed by members of the Washington, D.C. Climbing
Club,'' for example, the adjective ``biggest'' modifies the entire remainder of the phrase. There is no reason to
conclude that the word ``average'' in section 112(d)(3)(A) plays a different role.

Several commenters argued that the use of the words ``achieved by'' in the statute indicates that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sources within the top 12 percent must be achieving the emission limitations used to set the MACT Floor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA does not agree with this argument. The EPA believes the argument depends both on inferring the presence of the
word ``all'' in section 112(d)(3)(A), and (as discussed above) on ignoring, or incorrectly construing, the meaning
of the word ``average.'' Section 112(d)(3)(A) simply does not say ``the emission limitation achieved by all sources
within the best performing 12 percent*&blank;*&blank;*''. Congress' use of the words ``achieved by'' cannot reasonably
be stretched to accomplish such a rewriting of the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Arguments Concerning Structure of the Statute. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters argued that elements of the statute's structure support the Lower Floor Interpretation. For
example, some commenters argued that the Lower Floor Interpretation best reflects EPA's authority to consider cost
and other factors in setting standards more stringent than MACT Floor. Other commenters argued that the Lower Floor
Interpretation best reflects the distinction between existing source MACT and new source MACT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA does not agree with these arguments. In fact, the Higher Floor Interpretation fully preserves both of these
structural elements of the statute. With the Higher Floor Interpretation, just as with the Lower, EPA still has authority
to establish existing source standards more stringent than the Floor based on enumerated criteria. With the Higher
Floor Interpretation, just as with the Lower, there is still a distinction between the Floor for existing sources
and the level of control required for new sources. (Under section 112(d)(3), standards for new sources must be at least
as stringent as ``the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source''). The
fact that there may be ``less distance'' to travel above the Floor with the Higher Floor Interpretation does not establish
an inconsistency between that interpretation and other parts of the statute, nor does it mean that the interpretation
is flawed in any way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, structural arguments tend to favor the Higher Floor Interpretation more strongly than the Lower. Section
112 was passed in its current form to ensure quick and dramatic reductions in air toxics emissions. Congress was frustrated
with the slow pace of toxics control prior to 1990, and many members in part blamed EPA for weak controls. See, e.g.,
H. Comm. Rep. 101&hyph;490 at 150&hyph;54, 322&hyph;23; S. Rpt. 101&hyph;228 at 128&hyph;33. The structure and
purpose of section 112 as a whole indicates that section 112(d)(3)(A) was intended to establish a stringent minimum
level of control for hazardous air pollutants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Additional Arguments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters argued that the Higher Floor Interpretation would require EPA to set MACT Floors that failed to
correspond to real-world control technologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA does not agree with this argument. The EPA believes that the argument depends upon a flawed premise: That the
word ``average'' can only mean ``arithmetic mean.'' In fact, there are a number of conventional methods for determining
the average of a data set, including the median. Congress did not mandate a particular method of determining ``average''
or central tendency in section 112(d)(3)(A), and the choice of methodology_whether median, mean, or some other measure_can
often change the results markedly. For example, if the five facilities that make up the top 12 percent of a source category
are achieving reductions equal to 99 percent, 98 percent, 95 percent, 94 percent and 93 percent, EPA need not set the
MACT Floor equal to the arithmetic mean of these values, which is 95.8 percent. Using the Higher Floor Interpretation,
EPA could set the MACT Floor equal the median of these values, which is 95 percent.

C. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA believes that Congress spoke with clarity in section 112(d)(3)(A) of the Clean Air Act. That provision_requiring
standards to be no less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent than ``the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources''_lends
little support for an interpretation under which standards might be set at the emission limitation achieved by the
worst performing member of the best performing 12 percent of existing sources. The legislative history offers no
support for such an interpretation, and indeed points strongly in the opposite direction. The EPA believes that the
Higher Floor Interpretation represents the best reading of the statutory language.

II. Discretion in Setting Floors for MACT Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's notice, EPA announces its conclusion that Congress intended the Higher Floor Interpretation. The effect
of this decision, however, is not to identify any particular number (e.g. the 94th percentile) as the Floor for all
MACT standards. EPA retains discretion in important respects in setting Floors for MACT standards, and intends to
exercise its discretion, within the statutory framework, to promulgate MACT standards that best serve the public
interest.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes the Agency retains substantial discretion, within the statutory framework, to set MACT Floors at appropriate
levels. For example, because Congress did not define the term ``average'' in section 112(d)(3), or in the legislative
history, it implicitly delegated the authority to EPA to do so. The choice of methodology_whether mean, median, mode,
or some other measure_can often change the results. (The mean of a set of measurements is the sum of the measurements
divided by the number of measurements in the set. The median is the value in a set of measurements below and above which
there are an equal number of values, when the measurements are arranged in order of magnitude. The mode is the value
that occurs most often in a set of measurements). As some commenters noted, the ``average of the best performing 12%''
corresponds to the 94th percentile when the word ``average'' is construed to be the ``median.'' If, however, ``average''
is construed to be the ``arithmetic mean'' or ``mode,'' a different result may obtain. EPA construes the word ``average''
in section 112(d)(3) to authorize the Agency to use any reasonable method, in a particular factual context, of determining
the central tendency of a data set. In addition, EPA has discretion to use its best engineering judgment in collecting
and analyzing the data, and in assessing the data's comprehensiveness, accuracy and variability, in order to determine
which sources achieve the best emission reductions. EPA also has discretion in determining how to analyze the data,
and thus in determining the appropriate ``average'' in each category or subcategory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are other important ways that EPA retains discretion in setting MACT floors. For example, Congress authorized
EPA to subcategorize source categories based on classes, types and sizes of sources, which will result in different
Floors for different subcategories. CAA section 112(d)(1). Using this authority, EPA can tailor standards to certain
characteristics of particular emission units and sources. EPA retains flexibility, for example, to conclude that
the production processes used at particular sources in the relevant category are sufficiently different from processes
used at other sources in the same category to justify the creation of a new subcategory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These examples are not meant to be exhaustive. EPA has only begun the process of setting MACT standards. As EPA gains
experience in setting MACT Floors, other issues may arise that will require EPA to exercise its discretion in determining,
for each case, what represents the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12% of existing sources
(or the best performing five sources, in categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 sources).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its March 9, 1994 document, EPA stated that ``the MACT floor decision *&blank;*&blank;* in this rulemaking will
have broad precedential effect, and will be presumptively followed in subsequent MACT rulemakings.'' 59 FR 11018.
Several commenters objected this statement, arguing that the issue of how best to interpret section 112(d)(3)(A)
should have been addressed in a separate, generally applicable rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA wishes to emphasize that, although today's decision concerning the interpretation of Clean Air Act section
112(d)(3) for purposes of the HON will be precedential for future rulemakings, it will not be binding. Specifically,
EPA will fully consider all comments on individual MACT standards, including those regarding the proper interpretation
of the language in sec. 112(d)(3)(A), received on or before the close of the comment periods for those standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reopening the comment period, EPA requested comment on whether the control requirements for medium storage vessels
previously proposed by EPA would be appropriate in the event those proposed controls were to be determined to be more
stringent than the floor. Only four commenters addressed the question of the appropriate controls requirement for
medium storage vessels and provided rationale for their opinions. Of these commenters, only one submitted information
which purported to represent control information for SOCMI storage vessels. This information was reviewed and found
to not provide any information on control performance and to represent storage vessels associated with non-SOCMI
processes (i.e., other source categories) as well as SOCMI processes. Therefore, the submitted information could
not be used to revise the database. The EPA review of this information is contained in item VI&hyph;B&hyph;62 in docket
A&hyph;90&hyph;19. This section of the preamble, therefore, only presents the basis for the final decision on control
requirements for medium sized storage vessels.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For medium vessels, about 8 percent of the vessels are controlled with either a 90-percent efficient control device
or an IFR or EFR with a continuous seal. All of the controlled medium-sized vessels contained liquids with vapor pressures
of 13.1 kPa (1.9 psia). Because the arithmetic mean characteristics of the top 12 percent of the medium vessels would
not represent the performance of any known technology, the EPA used the median as the average for these vessels. Thus,
for medium-sized storage vessels, the floor determined by the average characteristics of the top 12 percent of the
sources would require control of vessels storing liquids with vapor pressures of 13.1 kPa (1.9 psia) by either a 90-percent
efficient control device or an IFR or EFR with a continuous seal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In selection of the control provisions for medium-sized storage vessels, EPA considered the regulatory alternatives
that were presented in the April 22, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document. These alternatives reflected a combination of: (1) The floor control for medium-sized storage vessels,
which at the time of proposal, were equipped with the floor controls and (2) the proposed control provisions for medium-sized
storage vessels which were equipped with no control or less efficient controls than the performance of the revised
floor component for the source-wide floor. The EPA did not develop a regulatory alternative corresponding to application
of the revised floor control level to all storage vessels. Such an alternative would have essentially the same control
costs as the proposed control provisions, but would result in a lower emission reduction. Because the floor control
would represent a less economically efficient option and would add to the complexity of the rule, this option was not
formally evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For medium storage vessels at existing sources, control at the regulatory alternative used to represent the floor
control was estimated to cost $2.4 million/yr and to result in an emission reduction of 370 Mg/yr (110 tons/yr). The
regulatory option for control level beyond the floor component is estimated to further reduce emissions by less than
100 Mg/yr (110 tons/yr) at an additional cost of $4 million/yr, or $48,000/Mg for each additional Mg of emission reduction.
Due to the relatively high incremental costs and low emission reductions of this alternative, the EPA believes that
the control level for the medium storage vessels component of the source-wide floor represented the maximum reduction
achievable considering cost and other impacts.

The reporting and recordkeeping burden of the information collection requirements of the provisions for medium
sized storage vessels are included in the estimate of the overall reporting burden, which is presented in ICR No. 1414.02.
The information collection requirements for the entire rule has an estimated annual reporting burden averaging
1,400 hours per response, and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 5,400 hours per respondent. These
estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final action regarding provisions applicable to medium sized storage vessels in facilities subject to the HON
has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the Order, the Administrator has assessed
the potential costs and benefits of the regulatory action. The methods for and results of these cost and benefit analyses
are described in the HON's Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA). The RIA was included in the HON docket at proposal, and
thus it was made available for public comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 also requires that the record for ``significant'' rules include an assessment of the potentially
effective and reasonably feasible alternatives to the planned action. The potentially effective and reasonably
feasible alternatives to the control requirements in the HON were also analyzed as part of the rule development process.
The methods for and results of these analyses are described in the HON's Background Information Document (BID). The
BID was included in the HON docket at proposal, and thus it was also available for public comment. In addition, many
of the alternative requirements considered by the Administrator were described in the preamble for the HON proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with selection of the final provisions are primarily the result of statutory requirements.
All elements of the cost that are not directly attributable to statutory requirements were deemed appropriate because
the Administrator determined that they were necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently.
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of this rule, the Administrator
has determined that the benefits justify the costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local and
tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions.

D. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires the EPA to consider potential impacts of Federal regulations on small business entities. If a preliminary
analysis indicates that a proposed regulation would have a significant economic impact on 20 percent or more of small
entities, then a regulatory flexibility analysis must be prepared.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory impacts are considered significant if any of the following criteria are met: (1) Compliance increases
annual production costs by more than 5 percent, assuming costs are passed on to consumers; (2) compliance costs as
a percentage of sales for small entities are at least 10 percent more than compliance costs as a percentage of sales
for large entities; (3) capital costs of compliance represent a ``significant'' portion of capital available to
small entities, considering internal cash flow plus external financial capabilities; or (4) regulatory requirements
are likely to result in closures of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs of the requirements for medium sized storage vessels were considered as part of the economic impact
analysis for the entire regulation. The assessment of the economic impacts of the overall regulation were presented
in the April 22, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 19449). Therefore, the addition of the final provisions to the standard does not alter the conclusion that the
standard is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this attached rule will not have an economic impact
on small entities because no additional costs will be incurred.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State of Kansas has applied for final approval of its underground storage tank (UST) program under subtitle I of
the Resource Conservation and Recover Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Kansas'
application and has reached a final determination that Kansas' underground storage tank program satisfies all of
the requirements necessary to qualify for final approval. Thus, EPA is granting final approval to the State of Kansas
to operate its program.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) enables EPA to approve state UST programs to operate
in the state in lieu of the Federal UST program. To qualify for final authorization, a state's program must: (1) Be ``no
less stringent'' than the Federal program in leak detection, maintaining records, release reporting, corrective
action, tank closure, financial responsibility, new tank standards and the notification requirements of section
9004(a)(8) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a)(8); and (2) provide for adequate enforcement (Section 9004(a) of RCRA, 42
U.S.C. 6991c(a)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 1, 1994, Kansas submitted an application for ``complete'' program approval which includes regulation
of both petroleum and hazardous substance tanks. Kansas also regulates heating oil tanks with the exception of tanks
used to store heating oil for consumptive use at a single family residence. However, this part of the Kansas program
is broader in scope than the Federal program and is not included in this final approval. On March 2, 1994, EPA published
a tentative decision announcing its intent to grant Kansas final approval. Further background on the tentative decision
to grant approval appears at 59 FR 9950, March 2, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of the application for public comment. Also, EPA provided notice that a public hearing would be provided
only if significant public interest on substantive issues was shown. EPA received no comments on the application
and no request for a public hearing, therefore, a public hearing was not held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that the State of Kansas' application for final approval meets all the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by subtitle I of RCRA. Accordingly, Kansas is granted final approval to operate its UST program. The State
of Kansas now has the responsibility for managing all regulated UST facilities within its borders and carrying out
all aspects of the UST program except with regard to Indian lands, where EPA will retain and otherwise exercise regulatory
authority. Kansas also has primary enforcement responsibility, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections
under section 9005 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d, and to take enforcement actions under section 9006 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991e.

Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. This approval effectively suspends the applicability of certain
Federal regulations in favor of Kansas' program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for owners and operators
of underground storage tanks in the state. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

 EPA is withdrawing a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) for the chemical substance generically described as an aromatic amino ether which was the subject of premanufacture
notice (PMN) P&hyph;90&hyph;1840. EPA initially published this SNUR using direct final rulemaking procedures.
EPA received critical comments on this rule. Therefore, the Agency is withdrawing this rule, as required under the
Expedited SNUR rulemaking process (40 CFR part 721 subpart D). In a separate notice of proposed rulemaking published
elsewhere in today's issue of the

 of October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51684), EPA issued several direct final SNURs including a SNUR for the substance described
generically as aromatic amino ether, PMN P&hyph;90&hyph;1840. As described in 40 CFR 721.160, EPA is withdrawing
the rule issued for P&hyph;90&hyph;1840 under direct final rulemaking procedures because the Agency received adverse
comments. As required by &sect;721.160(a)(3)(iii), EPA is proposing the rule published elsewhere in today's issue

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is modifying a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) for a fluorene substituted aromatic amine based on a modification to the TSCA section 5(e) consent order
regulating that chemical substance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 23, 1992 (57 FR 44050), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for fluorene substituted
aromatic amine (P&hyph;91&hyph;43). Because of the modification to the consent order for this substance, EPA is
modifying this SNUR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency proposed the modification of the SNUR for this substance in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 28, 1993 (58 FR 40397). The background and reasons for the modification of the SNUR are set forth in the preamble
to the proposed modification. The Agency received no public comment concerning the proposed modification. As a result
EPA is modifying this SNUR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Rationale for Modification of the Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this modification, EPA concluded
that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make
a reasoned evaluation of the health and environmental effects of the substance, and EPA identified the tests considered
necessary to evaluate the potential risks of the chemical substance. Specifically, EPA concluded that dermal and
respiratory protection, hazard communication requirements, limiting uses to industrial uses only, a production
volume limit, and a prohibition against releases to surface waters were necessary to control the potential unreasonable
risks of the substance. Based on these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter
and a SNUR was promulgated. In light of data received for an analogous substance which indicates that the PMN substance
is not expected to cause retinopathy, the submitter petitioned, and EPA determined, that the requirement that labels
and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) indicate that the PMN substance may cause blindness and that eye protection
should be worn when handling the substance was no longer appropriate and hence, was unnecessary to protect human health.
The section 5(e) order modification eliminated that labeling and MSDS requirement based on the finding of no retinopathy
effects. The modification of SNUR provisions for the substance designated herein is consistent with the modification
of the section 5(e) order.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Rulemaking Record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The record for the rule which EPA is modifying was established at OPPTS&hyph;50601. This record includes information
considered by the Agency in developing this rule and includes the modification to the consent order to which the Agency
has responded with this proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this rule would not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affected by this rule would
likely be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUR notices for the substance. Therefore, EPA believes
that the number of small businesses affected by this rule will not be substantial, even if all of the SNUR notice submitters
were small firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by OMB under the provisions of
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and have been assigned OMB control number 2070&hyph;0012.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response,
with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

The Agency proposed the revocation of the SNUR for this substance in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 7, 1993 (58 FR 27255). The background and reasons for the revocation of the SNUR are set forth in the preamble to
the proposed revocation. The Agency received no public comment concerning the proposed revocation. As a result EPA
is revoking this SNUR.

II. Objectives and Rationale of Revocation of the Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this revocation, EPA concluded
that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make
a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance, and that the substance is expected to be produced in substantial
quantities and there may be significant or substantial environmental exposure. EPA identified the tests necessary
to evaluate the risks of the substance. Based on these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the
PMN submitter, and a SNUR was promulgated. The consent order required the PMN submitter to perform toxicity testing
on the chemical substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reviewed testing conducted by the PMN submitter pursuant to the consent order for the substance and determined
that the information available was sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substance.
EPA concluded that, for the purposes of TSCA section 5, the substance will not present an unreasonable risk and subsequently
revoked the section 5(e) consent order. The revocation of SNUR provisions for the substance designated herein is
consistent with the revocation of the section 5(e) order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the above, EPA is revoking SNUR provisions for this chemical substance. EPA will no longer require notice
of any company's intent to manufacture, import, or process this substance. In addition, export notification under
section 12(b) of TSCA will no longer be required.

III. Rulemaking Record

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The record for the rule which EPA is revoking was established at OPPTS&hyph;50585 (P&hyph;89&hyph;1062). This record
includes information considered by the Agency in developing this rule and includes the test data to which the Agency

IV. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is revoking the requirements of this rule. Any costs or burdens associated with this rule will also be eliminated
when the rule is revoked. Therefore, EPA finds that no costs or burdens must be assessed under Executive Order 12866,
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), or the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for adipic acid, polymer with 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol,
dipropylene glycol, alkanepolyol, substituted alkanolamines, and carbomonocyclic dicarboxylic acid (P&hyph;89&hyph;653).
Because of additional data EPA has received for this substance, EPA is revoking this SNUR.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Parts 1720, 2070, 2510, and subpart 8352 of title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations are being removed in this administrative
final rule. In some instances, the statutory authorities prompting a part either have been repealed or have expired.
In other cases, the provisions of a part have been superseded by other regulations or replaced by BLM Manual provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 1720, which is being removed by this rule, lists policies pertaining to the disposal and management of the public
lands as managed by BLM before the enactment of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), 43 U.S.C.
1700 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These pre-FLPMA policies were based, to a considerable extent, on the Classification and Multiple Use Act, which
expired according to its own terms on December 23, 1970. The BLM's post-FLPMA management and disposal policies now
are reflected not only in FLPMA, but also in BLM's land use planning regulations, along with its other management-
or disposal-related regulations, and its manualized instructions to BLM personnel. The BLM's Manual is open to public
inspection. See 43 CFR 2.3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 2510 pertains to the homestead laws that were repealed on October 21, 1976 (as to Alaska, October 21, 1986), by
FLPMA. Because homestead entries no longer can be made with regard to the public lands of the United States, the regulations
in this part are no longer needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 2070 and subpart 8352 were used to designate areas and sites. The types of designations referred to in these provisions
have all been superseded by designations created in FLPMA and other laws. Such designations include areas of critical
environmental concern, covered in 43 CFR part 1600; national conservation areas and national recreation areas,
covered in various specific resource management regulations; wilderness, covered in part 8560; and national trails
and rivers, covered in part 8350.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this final rule is an administrative action to remove obsolete provisions, it has been determined that it
has no impacts on the public. The Department of the Interior, therefore, for good cause finds under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)
and 553(d)(3) that notice and public procedure thereon are unnecessary and that this rule may take effect upon publication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal author of this final rule is Jim Paugh of the BLM Wyoming State Office, assisted by the staff of the Division
of Legislation and Regulatory Management, BLM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this final rule is a purely administrative regulatory action having no effects upon the public or the environment,
it has been determined that the rule is categorically excluded from review under section 102(2)(C) of the National
Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.

As required by Executive Order 12630, the Department of the Interior has determined that the rule would not cause a
taking of private property. No private property rights would be affected by a rule that merely removes obsolete regulations
no longer governing activities on the public lands. The Department therefore certifies that this proposed rule does
not represent a governmental action capable of interference with constitutionally protected property rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Department has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Removing obsolete
regulations that no longer govern activities on the public lands will have no economic effect whatsoever.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501

This order revokes an Executive Order insofar as it affects approximately 54.47 acres of National Forest System land
and 8.91 acres of public land withdrawn for use by the Coast Guard, Department of Transportation, for the Woronkofski
Point Lighthouse. The land is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was withdrawn. This action will also open
the land within the Forest to such forms of disposition as may by law be made of National Forest System land. The land
has been and will continue to be subject to the Tongass National Forest reservation. Upon revocation, the public land
will be subject to the terms and conditions of Public Land Order No. 5180, as amended, and any other withdrawal of record.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regulations implementing Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Summer Flounder Fishery are found at
50 CFR part 625. The regulations require annual specification of a commercial quota that is apportioned among the
coastal states from North Carolina through Maine. The process to set the annual commercial quota and the percent allocated
to each state are described in &sect;625.20. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commercial quota for summer flounder for the 1994 calendar year set equal to 16,005,560 lb (7.3 million kg) and
the allocations to each state were published March 7, 1994 (59 FR 10586). NMFS issued a notification that the commercial
quota available to the State of Delaware for 1994 had been harvested, effective March 30, 1994 (59 FR 15863, April 5,
1994). The 1994 quotas for several states were adjusted for overages occurring in 1993, as required under &sect;625.20(d)(2),
on May 25, 1994. The quotas after adjustments for overages in 1993 for the states affected by this action were: Delaware,
^1,359 lb (^616 kg); Maryland, 324,117 lb (147,018 kg); North Carolina, 4,369,775 lb (1,982,117 kg); and Virginia,
3,242,354 lb (1,470,722 kg). Since Connecticut's quota was not exceeded in 1993, its 1994 quota of 361,258 lb (163,866
kg) did not need adjustment for overages prior to this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule implementing Amendment 5 to the FMP was published December 17, 1993 (58 FR 65936), and allows two or more
states, under mutual agreement and with the concurrence of the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director),
to transfer or combine summer flounder commercial quota. The Regional Director is required to consider the criteria
set forth in &sect;625.20(f)(1) in the evaluation of requests for quota transfers or combinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 625.20(3) further states that a state may not submit a request to transfer or combine quota if a request to which
it is party is pending before the Regional Director. While Delaware is the recipient of the four transfers, each request
to transfer quota was presented separately by each state, and therefore considered individually by the Regional
Director. Publication as one notification is efficient and convenient for reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia have agreed to transfer 96 lb (44 kg), 1,000 lb (454 kg), 2,782
lb (1,262 kg), and 2,162 lb (981 kg), respectively, of their commercial quotas to Delaware. The Regional Director
has determined that the criteria set forth in &sect;625.20(f) have been met, and publishes this notification of quota
transfers. The revised quotas for the calendar year 1994 are: Connecticut, 361,162 lb (163,822 kg); Delaware, 4,681
lb (2,123 kg); Maryland, 323,117 lb (146,565 kg); North Carolina, 4,366,993 lb (1,980,855 kg) and Virginia, 3,240,192
lb (1,469,742 kg). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because current landings estimates indicate that the Delaware inshore fishery has harvested the quota made available
through these transfers, no quota is currently available for landings in that State. Federally permitted vessels
may not land summer flounder in the State of Delaware. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action does not alter any of the conclusions reached in the Environmental Impact Statement prepared for Amendment
2 to the FMP regarding the effects of summer flounder fishing activity on the human environment. Amendment 2 established
procedures for setting an annual coastwide commercial quota for summer flounder and a formula for determining commercial
quotas for each state. The quota transfer provision was established by Amendment 5 to the FMP and the environmental
assessment prepared for Amendment 5 found that the action had no significant impact on the environment. Under &sect;6.02b.3(b)(i)(aa)
of NOAA Administrative Order 216&hyph;6, this action is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare
additional environmental analyses. This is a routine administrative action that reallocates commercial quotas
within the scope of previously published environmental analyses.

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 61 is 5,037 metric tons (mt), as established by the
1994 final specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) and modified in accordance with &sect;672.20(a)(2)(iv).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii),
that the 1994 second quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 61 soon will be reached. The Regional Director
established a directed fishing allowance of 4,400 mt, and has set aside the remaining 637 mt as bycatch to support other
anticipated groundfish fisheries. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has
been reached. Consequently, directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 61 is prohibited, effective from 12
noon, A.l.t., June 2, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., July 1, 1994.

 NMFS is prohibiting retention of sablefish by persons using trawl gear in the Bering Sea subarea (BS) of the Bering
Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area. NMFS is requiring that catches of sablefish by these persons in the
BS be treated in the same manner as prohibited species and discarded at sea with a minimum of injury. This action is necessary
because the share of the sablefish total allowable catch (TAC) assigned to trawl gear in the BS has been reached.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;675.24(c)(1)(i), the share of the sablefish TAC assigned to trawl gear in the BS was established
by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 230 metric tons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with &sect;675.24(d)(2), that the share of the
sablefish TAC assigned to trawl gear in the BS has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is requiring that further catches
of sablefish by persons using trawl gear in the BS be treated as prohibited species in accordance with &sect;675.20(c)(3),
effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., June 1, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.

I. Statutory and Regulatory Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Uniform Relocation Act Amendments of 1987 (Title IV, Pub. L. 100&hyph;17, April 2, 1987) (1987 Amendments) amended
the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Principal among the 1987 Amendments is an expanded definition of the term ``displaced person'' to include any person
who has moved or moved his personal property ``as a direct result of rehabilitation or demolition'' or privately undertaken
acquisition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the revised definition, an ``unlawful occupant'' or a person occupying a displacement dwelling ``for the purpose
of obtaining assistance,'' or a short-term renter who begins occupancy of the property with knowledge of its acquisition
for a project that involves displacement, is not a ``displaced person.'' (Section 402, 1987 Amendments.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In section 402(e) of the 1987 Amendments, the term ``comparable replacement dwelling'' is defined, in part, as a dwelling
that is adequate, decent, safe, and sanitary, functionally equivalent and generally in as desirable a location as
the location of the displaced person's dwelling. Also added by section 402(e) is a definition of the term ``displacing
agency'', which means ``any Federal agency carrying out a program or project, and any State, State agency, or person
carrying out a program or project with Federal financial assistance, which causes a person to be a displaced person.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 405 of the 1987 Amendments added a new paragraph 4 to section 202(a) of the URA to provide a maximum reestablishment
payment of $10,000 for a displaced farm, nonprofit organization, or small business. Section 202(c) of the URA also
was amended to change the range of the fixed payment that is available as an alternative to a payment for actual reasonable
moving and related expenses. The new fixed payment ranges from $1,000 to $20,000. The former payment ranged from $2,500
to $10,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 406 of the 1987 Amendments amended section 203(a) of the URA to increase the maximum payment under section
203 from $15,000 to $22,500 with respect to replacement housing for a homeowner, and under section 204, amended by
section 407 of the 1987 Amendments, the maximum payment was increased to $5,250 for a renter. However, when such amounts
are not sufficient to provide a comparable replacement dwelling as required by section 205(c)(3), agencies must
provide additional or alternative assistance to the displaced person. Such additional or alternative assistance
is authorized under section 206 (amended by section 409 of the 1987 Amendments). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 412 of the Amendments authorized the lead agency (Department of Transportation (DOT)) to issue, with the
active participation of HUD and other Federal agencies, regulations to implement the URA. On March 2, 1989, DOT issued
a government-wide final rule (see 54 FR 8912) to follow an interim rule issued by that agency on December 17, 1987 (see
52 FR 47994). On February 19, 1988 (53 FR 4964), HUD published an interim rule advising that it would make effective
as of April 2, 1989 ``all the rule changes necessary to implement amendments'' to the URA. (Section 418 of the 1987 Amendments
mandated that the amendments take effect no later than April 2, 1989.)

II. Public Comment on Interim HUD Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD received only one comment in response to the interim rule. The comment concerned the fact that HUD did not join with
DOT and certain other Federal agencies in the December 17, 1987 DOT interim final rule that implemented several of
the 1987 Amendments. The commenter thought that HUD's delay would result in lower replacement housing payments for
displaced persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DOT interim rule did not increase the amount of replacement housing assistance to be provided to a person displaced
from a dwelling. The URA ``common rule'' jointly published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (51 FR 7000) by HUD and 16 other Federal agencies on February 27, 1986, set forth an open-ended ``make whole'' standard
as the basis for determining the amount of replacement housing assistance to be provided to displaced persons.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the ``make whole'' approach, the displacing agency must provide assistance sufficient to enable the displaced
person to purchase or rent (for a 42-month period) a comparable replacement dwelling, irrespective of the payment
limits under section 203 (raised to $22,500 from $15,000) or section 204 (raised to $5,250 from $4,000) of the URA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the open-ended ``make whole'' approach to providing replacement housing assistance under the ``common rule''
and subsequent DOT interim and final rules, the sole impact of the DOT interim rule on the provision of replacement
housing assistance was the reduction of rental assistance payments by 12.5 percent (caused by reducing the period
of assistance from 48 to 42 months). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 407 of the 1987 Amendments requires that URA rental assistance payments to lower income persons ``take into
account such person's income.'' This change, implemented in the DOT final rule (but not in the DOT interim rule) substantially
increased the amount of replacement housing assistance to very low-income persons. During the period between implementation
of the DOT interim and final rule, URA replacement housing payments to tenants were higher under the now removed HUD
URA rule at 24 CFR part 42 than under the DOT interim rule.

III. Public Comment on Proposed Section 8 Project-Based Certificate Program Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 24, 1993, HUD published proposed relocation requirements (58 FR 11319) for the Section 8 Project-Based
Certificate Program (PBC). The requirements were published with a proposed rule to conform Section 8 tenant-based
rental certificate and rental voucher rules. The proposed PBC relocation policies were similar to those followed
in other HUD-assisted programs. Three comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first comment addressed the current PBC requirement that prohibits the displacement of any residential tenant
of a unit to be assisted under the PBC Program. On February 24, 1993, HUD proposed revising this policy to conform it
to the standard applicable to other HUD-assisted programs. That standard allows displacement, provided it is consistent
with the other goals and objectives of the program, and property owners take all reasonable steps to minimize it. One
commenter opposed this proposal, stating that the current regulation works well to prevent displacement and, in
extreme cases, can be waived. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD believes that the current PBC displacement prohibition eliminates many projects where the failure to carry out
timely rehabilitation leads to property deterioration that ultimately increases displacement_displacement
without assistance to those forced to relocate. Under the proposed rule, persons displaced by rehabilitation for
an assisted project would receive relocation assistance at URA levels, obtaining standard housing at a cost that
is usually lower than what they had been paying for substandard housing. Accordingly, HUD did not adopt the comment,
and the final rule reflects the ``minimize displacement'' standard that is followed in other HUD programs and described
in the proposed rule. Also, it is noted that a public housing agency or Indian housing authority (HA) could opt to provide
a unit selection preference for units where the rehabilitation will not result in the displacement of a family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second comment addressed PBC relocation policy regarding ``partially-assisted buildings.'' The term ``partially-assisted''
is used to describe a building in which some, but not all, of the units will be ``assisted'' with a project-based subsidy
upon completion of the rehabilitation. Under the current PBC policy, only the occupants of units to be assisted under
the section 8 HAP contract are protected by the URA. HUD proposed revising this policy to conform it to policy in other
HUD-assisted rehabilitation programs where the tenants in all rehabilitated units in the building are protected,
whether or not the units they occupy will receive a PBC subsidy.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter opposed the application of URA protections to occupants of non-assisted units in a partially-assisted
building. The commenter was concerned about the cost and indicated that the policy would subsidize discrimination
because families who don't want to live with assisted families would ``grab a pot of money and move.'' This observation
reflects a misunderstanding of the proposed rule. A tenant who is offered the opportunity to occupy the property upon
completion of the rehabilitation under reasonable terms and conditions is not entitled to relocation assistance
if he or she elects to relocate. Given the limited amount of rehabilitation (and relocation) that can be supported
with PBC subsidies, HUD does not anticipate significant displacement under the PBC program and, therefore, does
not expect significant relocation costs under the program. More importantly, those costs which do occur as a result
of a project should not be borne by the tenant. Accordingly, HUD did not adopt this comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third commenter asked that &sect;882.712(g)(3), which allows an HA to request HUD's determination as to whether
a displacement is or would be covered by the regulations, should include a requirement for a 30-day response time by
HUD. HUD will endeavor to respond to all HA requests as quickly as practicable and certainly within 30 days after all
relevant information is received. A regulatory requirement for a 30-day HUD response time would not be meaningful,
however, because HUD's failure to respond within that period could not serve as a basis for the HA to conclude that the
person was not eligible for relocation assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule is similar to the proposed rule. As with other HUD-assisted programs, in-place tenants, who will not
be displaced from the building/complex, must be provided a written notice, which offers the opportunity to lease
a unit in the building/complex under reasonable terms and conditions after the rehabilitation has been completed.
As described in &sect;882.712(g)(1)(iii)(A), such reasonable terms and conditions include a post-rehabilitation
rent that does not exceed the greater of: (1) The rent charged prior to the agreement, or (2) an affordable rent based
on the tenant's income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such reasonable terms and conditions also include reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by an in-place tenant who is required to relocate temporarily or to move permanently to another unit in the building/complex
so the rehabilitation can be carried out. If these conditions are not met and the in-place tenant moves permanently
from the building/complex, the tenant will be considered to have been displaced by the project and to be entitled to
relocation assistance at URA levels.

IV. This Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is being issued to conform existing HUD program regulations to the DOT final rule at 49 CFR part 24. This rule
does not reissue the DOT rule, but, for the benefit of HUD program users, adds definitions or descriptions that are
peculiar to HUD's programs. Also, the rule does not change any of the environmental program requirements or the compliance
requirements of 24 CFR parts 50 and 58. Users are urged to consult the DOT final rule (49 CFR part 24) for a more detailed
description of, and guidance for, all matters relating to displacement covered by the URA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the interim rule published by this agency on February 19, 1988, and now adopted by this rule, parts 42
and 43 have been removed, except that &sect;42.1 (the only section in 24 CFR part 42) remains as a guide-post to readers.
It advises readers to consult the DOT rule at 49 CFR part 24 for the regulations implementing the URA and the 1987 Amendments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain terms, although treated in the DOT rule, are nonetheless defined, where appropriate, in the several parts
of this rule. See, for example, the definitions contained in this rule for the terms ``displaced person'' and ``initiation
of negotiations.'' (These terms are defined in the DOT rule at 49 CFR 24.2(g) and 49 CFR 24.2(k), respectively.) The
terms ``displaced person'' and ``initiation of negotiations'' are defined in this rule in order to cover circumstances
unique to HUD's programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some areas, HUD program regulations reflect policy determinations which go beyond the letter of the URA. The URA
and the regulations at 49 CFR part 24 do not directly create eligibility for relocation assistance (as a ``displaced
person'') for a tenant-occupant who is permitted to remain in the property but moves from the property because he or
she cannot afford the rent charged upon completion of a project (economic displacement); who is required to relocate
temporarily, but not permanently, while the project is underway; or who must move permanently to other space in the
building/complex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, to protect such tenant-occupants, these program regulations provide that a tenant who moves permanently
because the terms and conditions of continued occupancy, temporary relocation, or relocation within the building/complex
are unreasonable will qualify as a ``displaced person'' who is entitled to relocation assistance at levels identical
to those required in 49 CFR part 24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of determining whether the economic displacement of a tenant has occurred, these regulations establish
as ``reasonable,'' a rent/utility charge that does not exceed the greater of: (1) A specified share of the person's
income (e.g., 30 percent of income), or (2) the tenant's old monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs.
A tenant who is required to pay a higher cost upon completion of the project may elect to remain in the project or move
permanently and obtain relocation assistance at URA levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to the various program regulations made by this rule reflect basic HUD policy. The HUD URA rule at 24 CFR
part 42 (now superseded) contained similar policies, as do regulations covering other HUD-assisted programs (e.g.,
the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program regulations at 24 CFR part 570).

Minimizing Displacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of statutory requirements (not superseded by the URA) governing some of HUD's programs, this rule provides,
where necessary, that grantees minimize displacement. See, e.g., 24 CFR 510.52(a). This standard HUD policy urges
grantees, consistent with the goals and objectives of the HUD program, to assure that they take reasonable steps to
minimize direct and indirect displacement as a result of a project. For example, if feasible, residential occupants
of buildings to be rehabilitated must be provided a reasonable opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent,
safe, sanitary and affordable dwelling unit in the building/complex following completion of the project. No comparable
provision is to be found in the DOT rule. That rule's purpose is to implement the URA.

At the time of publication of the interim rule, a finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment was
made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The proposed rule is adopted by this final rule without significant change. Accordingly,
the initial finding of no significant impact remains applicable, and is available for public inspection between
7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and,
thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The rule ensures that families that are affected by displacement activity
receive adequate assistance with respect to their relocation.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions,
or on their relationship with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between
them and other levels of government. The rule's major effects are on individuals and businesses. States or their political
subdivisions are affected by this rule only to the extent that they act as grantees of Federal funds, disbursing these
funds to the ultimate recipients_businesses and individuals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
displaced person
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' means any person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves
personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition
for a project assisted under this part. The term ``displaced person'' includes, but may not be limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex, permanently, after the Owner's execution
of the agreement covering the rehabilitation, demolition or acquisition, if the move occurs before the tenant is
provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary
dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such
reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed
the amount approved by HUD; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex,
if either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary
relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied unit, any increased housing costs and
incidental expenses; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex, permanently, after he or she has been required
to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
the move; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Any person, including a person who moves before the Owner's execution of the agreement covering the rehabilitation,
demolition, or acquisition, if the Owner or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from rehabilitation,
demolition or acquisition for the assisted project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced
person'' (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex permanently after he or she has been required
to move to another dwelling unit in the building/complex, if either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
the move; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced
person'' (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy
agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and the PHA determines that the
eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the preliminary proposal (or application, if there
is no preliminary proposal), and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, received written notice of the
project and its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer
a rent increase) and the fact that he or she would not qualify as a ``displaced person'' (or for any assistance provided
under this section) as a result of the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition
for the project.

Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601&hyph;4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.
A ``displaced person'' shall be advised of his/her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;19), and,
if the representative comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment
to be provided to a minority person is located in an area of minority concentration, such person also shall be given,

(1) As soon as possible after the date described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, the PHA shall issue a general
information notice (described in 49 CFR 24.203(a)) to each occupant of the property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) At the time of the initiation of negotiations (defined in paragraph (i) of this section), the PHA shall issue an
appropriate written notice to each person occupying the property. Those to be displaced shall be issued a notice of

(1) The PHA shall certify (i.e., provide assurance of compliance, as required by 49 CFR part 24) that it will comply
with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section, and shall ensure such compliance
notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the PHA to comply. The certification in the PHA's ``Resolution
in Support of Public Housing Project'' that the PHA will comply with all the requirements of 24 CFR part 941 shall constitute
the PHA's certification of compliance with the URA, the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The cost of required assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project

(1) For conventional or acquisition projects: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

form HUD&hyph;51971&hyph;II). However, if the PHA issues a notice of intent to acquire the property, and a person
moves after that notice, but before the initial written purchase offer, the ``initiation of negotiations'' is the
actual move of the person from the property; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For turnkey projects, HUD Field Office approval of the PHA's proposal incorporating the developer's proposal,
