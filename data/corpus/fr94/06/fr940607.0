SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management is adopting as final the interim regulations authorizing payment of a separate
maintenance allowance to Federal civilian employees assigned to Johnston Island, a nonforeign post of duty dedicated
to chemical weapon storage and disposal facilities. A separate maintenance allowance assists an employee in meeting
some of the additional expenses of maintaining a spouse and/or dependents elsewhere who would normally reside with
the employee. The final regulations provide for determining which employees are eligible for the separate maintenance
allowance, which relatives qualify as dependents, the method of payment, and the payment amounts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published an interim rule on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51565). The 30-day public
comment period ended on November 3, 1993. No comments were received on the interim rule; therefore, OPM is adopting
as final the interim rule implementing section 1092 of Public Law 102&hyph;190, December 5, 1991 (the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993). Section 1092 amended chapter 59 of title 5, United States Code,
by adding section 5942a to provide a separate maintenance allowance to assist an employee assigned to Johnston Island
to meet the additional expenses of maintaining a spouse and/or dependents elsewhere who would normally reside with
the employee. On November 16, 1992, this regulatory authority was delegated to OPM by Executive Order 12822.

The final regulations provide procedures and rules under which the head of the agency may determine eligibility for
a separate maintenance allowance and the appropriate payment amount. The regulations define: (1) Dependents, (2)
the annual rate to be paid to an employee according to the number of his or her dependents, (3) the method of payment,
and (4) the responsibilities of the agencies and OPM.

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Hartzell Propeller Inc. Model HC&hyph;E4A&hyph;3A/E10950()
composite bladed propellers installed on but not limited to Beech Model 1900D aircraft. This action requires installation
of new propeller blade pitch change knob twelve point flange head attachment bolts, new preload plates, and new propeller
blade pitch change knob brackets. This amendment is prompted by reports of 15 propeller blade pitch change knob screw
failures found during routine maintenance. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent a severe propeller
vibration in flight and possible loss of propeller pitch control.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) received reports of 15 propeller blade pitch change knob screw failures
found during routine maintenance on Hartzell Propeller Inc. Model HC&hyph;E4A&hyph;3A/E10950() composite bladed
propellers installed on but not limited to Beech Model 1900D aircraft. The FAA also received pilot reports of vibration
and unusual propeller noise, and additional reports of several incidents when the propeller would not go completely
into the feather position after engine shutdown on the ground. Investigation into these incidents revealed a failed
screw head had lodged in the internal pitch change mechanism. Investigation further reveals that the screws failed
due to high cycle fatigue. This condition, if not corrected, could result in a severe propeller vibration in flight
and possible loss of propeller pitch control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of Hartzell Propeller Inc. Alert Service Bulletin (ASB)
No. A190, dated January 17, 1994, that describes procedures for installation of new propeller blade pitch change
knob twelve point flange head attachment bolts to replace the countersunk screws currently used, new preload plates,
and new propeller blade pitch change knob brackets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Hartzell Propeller Inc. Model
HC&hyph;E4A&hyph;3A/E10950() composite bladed propellers of the same type design, this airworthiness directive
(AD) is being issued to prevent a severe propeller vibration in flight and possible loss of propeller pitch control.
This AD requires installation of a design change to the propeller pitch change knob attachment. This installation
consists of new propeller blade pitch change knob twelve point flange head attachment bolts to replace the countersunk
screws currently used, new preload plates, and new propeller blade pitch change knob brackets. Propellers with serial
numbers HJ199 and greater are excluded from this AD, as the propellers were modified during manufacturing. The actions
are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;05.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Beech Model 400A and 400T airplanes, that requires inspection to detect damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the wire harness in the wheel well of the main landing gear (MLG), and modification, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. This amendment is prompted by reports of damage to wire harnesses due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abrasion. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of control of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel supply to the engine or loss of control of the retraction/extension system for the MLG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and MLG door.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain Beech Model 400A and 400T airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 5965). That action proposed to require inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to detect damage of the wire harness in the wheel well of the main landing gear (MLG), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and modification, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 59 Model 400A and 400T airplanes of the affected design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 46 airplanes of U.S. registry will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be $5,060, or $110 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Airbus Model A300 series airplanes,
that requires modification of certain evacuation door slides. This amendment is prompted by a report that, during
flight crew training, the toe end of the slide lane tore. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent damage
to the slide, which could render the slide unusable, contribute to injury of passengers on the slide, and delay or impede
the evacuation of passengers during an emergency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Airbus Industrie Model A300 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 5964). That action proposed to require modification of certain evacuation door slides.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the two comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both commenters support the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently there are no Airbus Industrie Model A300 series airplanes equipped with BFGoodrich evacuation door slides
on the U.S. register. However, should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future,
the FAA estimates that it will take approximately 6.2 work hours per slide to accomplish the required actions, and
that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be provided by BFGoodrich at no cost to the operators.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD would be $341 per slide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes,
that requires modification of the aileron drive quadrant support structure. This amendment is prompted by results
of a stress analysis check, which revealed that the factor of safety of the aileron drive quadrant support structure
on Model 4101 airplanes does not meet the tail-to-wind gust load design case strength requirements specified in the
Federal Aviation Regulations. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent cracking of the support structure,
which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Jetstream 4101 airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5359). That action proposed to require modification of the aileron drive quadrant support
structure below the flight compartment floor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 4 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 20 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of
the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,400, or $1,100 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 This document contains the final regulations relating to the circumstances in which a party shall be deemed to have
exhausted the administrative remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of the recovery
of court costs and certain fees in a civil tax proceeding brought in a court of the United States (including the Tax Court
and the Court of Federal Claims). These regulations differ from the final regulations previously issued under section
7430, which were effective for civil tax proceedings commenced after February 28, 1983, and before January 1, 1986,
and addressed the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement for recovery of litigation costs incurred
by taxpayers with respect to a court proceeding in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any
tax, interest, or penalty. Portions of the final regulations previously issued under section 7430 were held to be
invalid by the United States Tax Court in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 301) under section 7430 of the Internal Revenue Code
(the Code) were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 8, 1992 (57 FR 19828 [IA&hyph;003&hyph;89, 1992&hyph;1 C.B. 1100]). The amendments were issued under the authority
contained in section 7805 of the Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One public comment was received concerning these regulations. After consideration of the public comment received,
the proposed regulations are adopted, as revised by this Treasury decision.

Explanation of Regulatory Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, under section 7430 of the Code, a prevailing party may recover the reasonable litigation costs incurred
in a civil proceeding if the proceeding relates to the determination, collection or refund of any tax, interest or
penalty under the Internal Revenue Code and the party has exhausted all the administrative remedies related to that
party's tax matter. These final regulations provide information concerning the circumstances in which a party's
administrative remedies shall be deemed to have been exhausted. In general, administrative remedies are deemed
to have been exhausted if the party has requested (and if granted, participated in) an Appeals office conference on
the party's tax matter prior to filing an action in a court of the United States (including the Tax Court and the Court
of Federal Claims). A party has participated in an Appeals office conference if the party has disclosed all relevant
information regarding the matter to the Appeals office. In the case of the revocation of a determination that an organization
is described in section 501(c)(3), a party must complete the procedures set forth in section 7428 and in regulations,
rules and revenue procedures thereunder to exhaust its administrative remedies. Where no administrative procedure
covering a party's tax matter allows the party to request an Appeals office conference, the party's administrative
remedies will not be deemed to have been exhausted unless the party has filed a written claim for relief with the district
director having jurisdiction over the tax matter and allowed the district director a reasonable period of time to
act on the claim. A party is not required to pursue its administrative remedies if the Internal Revenue Service has
notified the party in writing that such pursuit is unnecessary, has not given the party an opportunity to request an
Appeals office conference before sending a statutory notice of deficiency, or has failed to grant the party an Appeals
office conference with respect to a claim for refund within six months of the filing of such claim for refund. A party
must participate in an Appeals office conference during either the deficiency procedures or the refund procedures
with respect to the tax matter, but is not required to participate during both procedures. Thus, if a party participated
in an Appeals office conference with respect to a tax matter prior to the issuance of the statutory notice of deficiency,
the party does not need to request an Appeals office conference after filing a claim for refund with respect to the same
tax matter.

Comments on the Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One public comment objected to, and requested deletion of, the requirement that a party request (and if granted, participate
in) an Appeals office conference on the party's tax matter prior to filing an action in a court of the United States (including
the Tax Court and the Court of Federal Claims). This suggestion was not adopted in the final regulations because conferences
with Appeals have historically been a fundamental method for providing administrative remedies to taxpayers who
do not agree with the Internal Revenue Service. Such remedies are pivotal to the effort to resolve issues promptly,
efficiently, fairly and without resort to litigation. In order to avoid costly litigation consistent with the legislative
intent and to encourage usage of this process to resolve disputes, the regulations require taxpayers, in order to
be deemed to have exhausted their administrative remedies, to pursue such remedies with the Appeals office, if available,
prior to instituting litigation.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice
of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment
on their impact on small business.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Taxpayer A exchanges property held for investment for similar property and claims that the gain on the exchange is
not recognized under section 1031. The Internal Revenue Service conducts a field examination and determines that
there has not been a like-kind exchange. No agreement is reached on the matter and a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day
letter) is sent to A. A does not file a request for an Appeals office conference. A pays the amount of the proposed deficiency
and files a claim for refund. A notice of proposed disallowance is issued by the Internal Revenue Service. A does not
request an Appeals office conference and, instead, files a civil action for refund in a United States District Court.
A has not exhausted the administrative remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service.

office conference and files a civil action for refund in a United States District Court. A has exhausted the administrative
remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service.

all relevant legal arguments supporting the taxpayer's position. B properly requests an Appeals office conference.
The Appeals office, to obtain an additional period of time to consider the tax matter, requests that B sign Form 872
to extend the time for an assessment of tax, but B declines. Appeals then denies the request for a conference and issues
a notice of deficiency. B has exhausted the administrative remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service.

On January 2, the Internal Revenue Service serves a summons issued under section 7609 on third-party recordkeeper
D to produce records of taxpayer E. On January 5, notice of the summons is given to E. The last day on which E may file a petition
in a court of the United States to quash the summons is January 25. Thereafter, E files a written claim for relief with
the district director having jurisdiction over the matter together with a copy of the summons. The claim and copy are
received by the district director on January 20. On January 25, E files a petition to quash the summons. E has exhausted
the administrative remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service.

A notice of Federal tax lien is filed in County M on March 3, in the name of F. On April 2, F pays the entire liability thereby
satisfying the lien. On May 2, F files a written claim with the district director having jurisdiction over the tax matter
demanding a certificate of release of lien. Thereafter, F provides the district director with a copy of the notice
of Federal tax lien and a copy of the canceled check in satisfaction of the lien, which are received by the district director
on May 15. F's claim is deemed to have been filed on May 15. Accordingly, F must wait until after July 14 (60 days following
the filing of the claim for relief on May 15) to commence an action, in order to have exhausted the administrative remedies
available within the Internal Revenue Service.

A revenue officer seizes an automobile to effect collection of G's liability on January 10. On January 22, H submits
a written claim to the district director having jurisdiction over the tax matter claiming that H purchased the automobile
from G for an adequate consideration before the tax lien against G arose, and demands immediate return of the automobile.
A copy of the title certificate and H's canceled check are submitted with the claim. The claim is received by the district
director on January 25. On January 30, H brings a wrongful levy action. H has exhausted the administrative remedies
available within the Internal Revenue Service.

Example 9. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Internal Revenue Service issues a revenue ruling which holds that ear piercing does not affect a function or structure
of the body within the meaning of section 213 and therefore is not deductible. Taxpayer I deducts the costs of ear piercing
and, following an examination, receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter) disallowing the treatment
of such costs. Because of the revenue ruling, I believes a conference would not aid in the resolution of the tax dispute.
Accordingly, I does not request an Appeals office conference. After receiving a statutory notice of deficiency,
I files a petition in the Tax Court. I has not exhausted the administrative remedies available within the Internal
Revenue Service. The issuance of a revenue ruling covering the same fact situation but taking a contrary position
does not constitute notification by the Internal Revenue Service to I that the pursuit of administrative remedies
is unnecessary. Similarly, the issuance to I of a private letter ruling or technical advice does not constitute notification
by the Internal Revenue Service that the pursuit of administrative remedies is unnecessary.

Taxpayer J is assessed a penalty under section 6701 for aiding in the understatement of the tax liability of another
person. J pays 15% of the penalty in accordance with section 6703 and files a claim for refund on June 15. J is not issued
a notice of proposed disallowance and thus cannot participate in an Appeals office conference within six months of
the filing of the claim for refund. J brings an action on December 23. J has exhausted the administrative remedies available
within the Internal Revenue Service.

statutory notice, and after filing a petition with the Tax Court, K requests an Appeals office conference. K has not
exhausted the administrative remedies available within the Internal Revenue Service because the request for an
Appeals office conference was made after the issuance of the statutory notice.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains the final regulations relating to the recovery of reasonable administrative costs incurred
by taxpayers in connection with an administrative proceeding within the Internal Revenue Service. Changes to the
applicable law were made by section 6239(a) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (TAMRA) (Pub. L.
No. 100&hyph;647, 102 Stat. 3342). These regulations affect all taxpayers involved in an administrative proceeding
within the Internal Revenue Service, and provide guidance regarding the definition of reasonable administrative
costs and the period within which the costs must be incurred in order to be recoverable. These regulations also set
forth the requirements and procedures for the recovery of such costs, and the definitions of prevailing party, administrative
proceeding and administrative proceeding date. A table of contents to the regulations under section 7430 is provided
in &sect;301.7430&hyph;0.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed additions to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR Part 301) under section 7430 of the Internal Revenue Code
(the Code) were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 23, 1992 (57 FR 61020 [IA&hyph;003&hyph;89, 1993&hyph;1 C.B. 789]). These proposed additions were issued
under the authority contained in section 7805 of the Code. A summary of the proposed additions is contained in the preamble
that was published with the proposed additions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes to the Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No changes have been made to the proposed regulations. One public comment objected to the failure of the regulations
to provide for the recovery of amounts expended by taxpayers during the examination of their returns. As section 7430
does not provide for such awards, this suggestion was not adopted. After consideration of the public comment received,
the proposed regulations are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice
of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment
on their impact on small business.

Introduction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 7430(a)(1) provides for the recovery, under certain circumstances, of reasonable administrative costs
incurred in connection with an administrative proceeding before the Internal Revenue Service. Paragraph (b) of
this section lists the requirements that a taxpayer must meet to be entitled to an award of reasonable administrative
costs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Internal Revenue Service will grant a taxpayer's request for recovery of reasonable administrative costs incurred
in connection with an administrative proceeding under section 7430 and this section only if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The underlying substantive issues or the issue of reasonable administrative costs are not, and have never been, before
any court of the United States (including the Tax Court or United States Court of Federal Claims) with jurisdiction
over those issues; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasonable administrative costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The costs were reasonable administrative costs as defined in &sect;301.7430&hyph;4; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Prevailing party.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The taxpayer is a prevailing party as defined in &sect;301.7430&hyph;5; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Not unreasonably protracted.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The administrative proceeding was not unreasonably protracted by the taxpayer as discussed in paragraph (d) of this
section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedural requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The taxpayer follows the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination by court.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the Internal Revenue Service will not grant a request for reasonable administrative costs where the requirements
of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are not met, a taxpayer may file a claim for reasonable administrative costs
with the court with jurisdiction over the judicial proceeding. The court may award the taxpayer reasonable administrative
costs under section 7430(a). Under section 7430(c)(4)(B)(ii), where the final determination with respect to the
tax, interest, or penalty at issue is made by a court, the court determines whether the taxpayer qualifies as a prevailing
party. Thus, where the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are not met, the taxpayer's only possibility
of obtaining an award of reasonable administrative costs is to obtain an award of such costs from the court. In the event
the court awards reasonable administrative costs, it may also award litigation costs for the reasonable costs of
pursuing the claim for reasonable administrative costs, provided the requirements under section 7430 regarding
an award of reasonable administrative costs are satisfied with respect to such costs. A claim filed with the court
should be made in accordance with the rules of the court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedure for recovering reasonable administrative costs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Internal Revenue Service will not award administrative costs under section 7430 unless the taxpayer files a written
request to recover reasonable administrative costs in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

the taxpayer making the request, the taxpayer may send the request to the District Director for the district that considered
the underlying matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Form of Request.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No specific form is required for the request other than one which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of
this section. Where practicable the required statements may be included in a single document. Similarly, where practicable,
the required affidavits may be combined in a single affidavit to the extent they are to be executed by the same person.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Period for requesting costs from the Internal Revenue Service.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To recover reasonable administrative costs pursuant to section 7430 and this section, the taxpayer must file a request
for costs no later than 90 days after the date the final decision of the Internal Revenue Service with respect to all
tax, additions to tax and penalties at issue in the administrative proceeding is mailed, or otherwise furnished,
to the taxpayer. The final decision of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of this section is the document which
resolves the tax liability of the taxpayer with regard to all tax, additions to tax and penalties at issue in the administrative
proceeding (such as a Form 870 or closing agreement), or a notice of assessment for that liability (such as the notice
and demand under section 6303), whichever is earlier mailed, or otherwise furnished, to the taxpayer. For purposes
of this section, if the 90th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, the 90-day period shall end on the next
succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday. The term legal holiday means a legal holiday in the
District of Columbia. If the request for costs is to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service at an office of the Internal
Revenue Service located outside the District of Columbia but within an internal revenue district, the term legal
holiday also means a Statewide legal holiday in the State where such office is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Internal Revenue Service is authorized, but not required, to notify the taxpayer of its decision to grant or deny
(in whole or in part) an award for reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and this section by certified
mail or registered mail. If the Internal Revenue Service does not respond on the merits to a request by the taxpayer
for an award of reasonable administrative costs filed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section within 6 months after
such request is filed, the Internal Revenue Service's failure to respond may be considered by the taxpayer as a decision
of the Internal Revenue Service denying an award for reasonable administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Appeal to Tax Court.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A taxpayer may appeal a decision by the Internal Revenue Service denying (in whole or in part) a request for reasonable
administrative costs under section 7430 and this section by filing a petition for reasonable administrative costs
with the Tax Court. The petition must be in accordance with the Tax Court's Rules of Practice and Procedure and must
be filed with the Tax Court after the Internal Revenue Service denies (in whole or in part) the taxpayer's request for
reasonable administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unreasonable protraction of administrative proceeding.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An award of reasonable administrative costs will not be made where the taxpayer unreasonably protracted the administrative
proceeding. However, a taxpayer that unreasonably protracted only a portion of the administrative proceeding,
but not other portions of the administrative proceeding, may recover reasonable administrative costs for the portion(s)
of the administrative proceeding that the taxpayer did not unreasonably protract, if the requirements of paragraph
(b)(1) of this section are otherwise satisfied.

Example 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Taxpayer A receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). A requests and is granted Appeals office consideration.
Appeals requests that A submit certain documents as substantiation for the tax matters at issue. Although A complies
with this request, the information is misdirected and not considered by Appeals. Appeals then issues a notice of deficiency.
A does not file a petition with the Tax Court. After receiving the notice of deficiency, A convinces Appeals that the
notice of deficiency is incorrect and that A owes no tax. Appeals then closes the case showing a zero deficiency and
mails A a notice to this effect. Assuming that the other requirements of this section are satisfied, A may recover reasonable
administrative costs incurred after the date of the notice of deficiency (the administrative proceeding date).
To recover these costs, A must file a request for costs with the Appeals office personnel who settled A's tax matter,
or if that person is unknown to A, with the District Director of the district which considered the underlying matter,
within 90 days after the date of mailing of the Office of Appeals' final decision that A owes no tax.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
except that after receipt of the notice of deficiency, A meets with an Appeals officer, but no agreement is reached
on the tax matters at issue. A then files a petition with the Tax Court and prevails. Since the underlying tax issues
have been determined by a court, the Internal Revenue Service will not grant a request for recovery of the reasonable
administrative costs incurred by A. To recover reasonable administrative costs, A must file a claim with the Tax Court
as prescribed under the Tax Court's Rules of Practice and Procedure.

Administrative proceeding. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of section 7430, an administrative proceeding generally means any procedure or other action before
the Internal Revenue Service that is commenced after November 10, 1988. However, an administrative proceeding does
not include_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Proceedings involving matters of general application, including hearings on regulations, comments on forms,
or proceedings involving revenue rulings or revenue procedures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Proceedings involving requests for private letter rulings or similar determinations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Proceedings involving technical advice memoranda, except those submitted after the administrative proceeding
date (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Proceedings in connection with collection actions (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section), including proceedings
under sections 7432 or 7433.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Collection action. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A collection action generally includes any action taken by the Internal Revenue Service to collect a tax (or any interest,
additional amount, addition to tax, or penalty, together with any costs in addition to the tax) or any action taken
by a taxpayer in response to the Internal Revenue Service's act or failure to act in connection with the collection
of a tax (including any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or penalty, together with any costs in addition
to the tax). For example, a collection action for purposes of section 7430 and this section includes any action taken
by the Internal Revenue Service under Chapter 64 of Subtitle F to collect a tax. Collection actions also include those
actions taken by a taxpayer to remedy the Internal Revenue Service's failure to release a lien under section 6325 and
to remedy any unauthorized collection action as defined by section 7433. However, an action or procedure directly
relating to a claim for refund filed with the Service Center's Collection Branch or District Director's Collection
Division after payment of an assessed tax is not a collection action.

General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, the term administrative proceeding date means the earlier
of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The date of the receipt by the taxpayer of the notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The date of the notice of deficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder, a notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service
Office of Appeals is the final written document, mailed or delivered to the taxpayer, that is signed by an individual
in the Office of Appeals who has been delegated the authority to settle the dispute on behalf of the Commissioner, and
states or indicates that the notice is the final determination of the entire case. A notice of claim disallowance issued
by the Office of Appeals is a notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals. Solely for purposes
of determining the administrative proceeding date, a notice of deficiency issued by the Office of Appeals is not a
notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of deficiency. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A notice of deficiency is a notice described in section 6212(a), including a notice rescinded pursuant to section
6212(d). For purposes of determining reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and the regulations thereunder,
a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment described in section 6223(a)(2) will be treated as a notice
of deficiency. A notice of final S corporation administrative adjustment issued pursuant to section 6223(a)(2)
as made applicable to subchapter S items by section 6244 will also be treated as a notice of deficiency.

Taxpayer A receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). A files a request for and is granted an Appeals
office conference. At the conference, an agreement is reached on the tax matters at issue. A cannot recover any costs
because they were not incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date, which is the earlier of the date of receipt
by the taxpayer of the notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals, or the date of the notice
of deficiency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Taxpayer B receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). B pays the amount of the proposed deficiency
and files a claim for refund. B's claim is disallowed and a notice of proposed disallowance is issued by the District
Director. B does not request an Appeals office conference and the District Director issues a notice of claim disallowance.
B then files suit in a United States District Court. B cannot recover reasonable administrative costs because, although
the District Director issued a notice of claim disallowance, the Internal Revenue Service did not issue either a notice
of decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals or a notice of deficiency.

except that after B files a claim for refund and receives the notice of proposed disallowance, B requests and is granted
Appeals office consideration. No agreement is reached with Appeals and the Office of Appeals issues a notice of claim
disallowance. B does not file suit in District Court but instead contacts the Appeals office to attempt to reverse
the decision. B convinces the Appeals officer that the notice of claim disallowance is in error. The Appeals officer
then abates the assessment. Because a notice of claim disallowance issued by Appeals is a notice of the decision of
the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals, B may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred on or after
the receipt of the notice of claim disallowance (the administrative proceeding date), but only if the other requirements
of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. B cannot recover the costs incurred prior to receipt
of the notice of claim disallowance because they were incurred before the administrative proceeding date.

Instead, C pays the deficiency and files a claim for refund. The claim for refund is considered by the Internal Revenue
Service and the District Director issues a notice of proposed disallowance. C requests and is granted Appeals office
consideration. C convinces Appeals that C's claim is correct and Appeals allows C's claim. C may recover reasonable
administrative costs incurred on or after the date of the notice of deficiency (the administrative proceeding date),
but only if the other requirements of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied.

Taxpayer E files an individual income tax return showing a balance due. No payment is made with the return and the Internal
Revenue Service assesses the amount shown on the return. The Internal Revenue Service issues a notice and demand for
tax pursuant to section 6303. E contacts the Collection Division (Collection) regarding E's outstanding liability.
No agreement is reached with respect to the timing of E's payment, and Collection issues a notice of intent to levy pursuant
to section 6331(d). Prior to the levy, E enters into an installment agreement with Collection. The costs that E incurred
in connection with the notice and demand were not incurred in an administrative proceeding, but rather in a collection
action. Accordingly, E may not recover those costs as reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and the
regulations thereunder.

Appeals considers the issues and decides to uphold Collection's recommended assessment. Appeals notifies F of this
decision in writing. Collection then assesses the tax. Pursuant to section 6672(b), within 30 days after the notice
and demand is made, F pays the minimum amount required to commence a court proceeding, files a claim for refund, and
furnishes the required bond. Collection then considers and disallows the claim. Appeals then reconsiders the claim
and reverses its original position, thus upholding F's position. Appeals then abates the assessment. F may recover
reasonable administrative costs incurred after the receipt of the original decision of Appeals (the administrative
proceeding date) that Appeals was upholding Collection's recommended assessment, but only if the other requirements
of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. F cannot recover costs that are attributable to any
procedure or other action before Collection prior to filing F's administrative claim for refund.

Representative and specially qualified representative_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Representative. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A representative is a person compensated for services rendered in connection with the administrative proceeding,
who is authorized to practice before the Internal Revenue Service or the Tax Court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Specially qualified representative. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(3)(iii) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a specially qualified representative is
a representative (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section) possessing a distinctive knowledge or a unique
and specialized skill that is necessary to adequately represent the taxpayer in the proceeding. Examples of a unique
and specialized skill or distinctive knowledge would be an identifiable practice specialty such as patent law or
knowledge of a foreign law or language where such specialty or knowledge is necessary to adequately represent the
taxpayer in the proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, neither knowledge of tax law nor experience in representing
taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service is considered distinctive knowledge or a unique and specialized skill.
An extraordinary level of general representational knowledge and ability that is useful in all proceedings is not
considered, in and of itself, distinctive knowledge or a unique and specialized skill. Specially qualified representatives
also do not include those who have a distinctive knowledge of the underlying subject matter of the controversy in circumstances
where such distinctive knowledge could reasonably be supplied through the use of an expert, or could readily be obtained
through literature pertaining to the subject.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as otherwise provided in this section, fees described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section that are recoverable
under section 7430 and the regulations thereunder as reasonable administrative costs may not exceed $75 per hour
increased by a cost of living adjustment (and if appropriate, a special factor adjustment).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Internal Revenue Service will make a cost of living adjustment to the $75 per hour limit by using the Consumer Price
Index of All-Urban Consumers (CPI&hyph;U) published by the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics and referenced
in Internal Revenue Code section 1(f)(5). If the CPI&hyph;U is no longer published, a comparable index will be used,
and any reference in this section to the CPI&hyph;U will be considered to refer to such comparable index.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Percentage adjustment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the base year for determining the cost of living adjustment
is the calendar year 1986. The cost of living adjustment for fees incurred in any calendar year subsequent to 1986 is
the percentage (if any) by which the yearly average CPI&hyph;U for the calendar year immediately prior to the year
in which the fees are incurred exceeds the January CPI&hyph;U for the calendar year 1986.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the presence of a special factor is demonstrated by the taxpayer, the amount reimbursable is the amount of reasonable
fees paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with the proceeding for the services of a representative as defined
in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special factor. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A special factor is a factor, other than an increase in the cost of living, which justifies an increase in the $75 per
hour limitation of section 7430(c)(1)(B)(iii). The novelty and difficulty of the issues, the undesirability of
the case, the work and the ability of counsel, the results obtained, and customary fees and awards in other cases, are
factors applicable to a broad spectrum of litigation and do not constitute special factors for the purpose of increasing
the $75 per hour limitation. The limited availability of a specially qualified representative for the proceeding
does constitute a special factor justifying an increase in the $75 per hour limitation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limited availability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unless disputed by the Internal Revenue Service, limited availability of a specially qualified representative
is established by demonstrating that a specially qualified representative for the proceeding is not available at
the $75 per hour rate (as adjusted for an increase in the cost of living). Initially, this showing may be made by submission
of an affidavit signed by the taxpayer or by the taxpayer's counsel, that in a case similar to the taxpayer's, a specially
qualified representative that practices within a reasonable distance from the taxpayer's principal residence
or principal office would normally charge a client similar to the taxpayer at a rate in excess of this amount. If the
Internal Revenue Service challenges this initial showing, the taxpayer may submit additional evidence to establish
the limited availability of a specially qualified representative at the rate specified above.

Example.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Taxpayer A is represented by B, a CPA and attorney with an LL.M. Degree in Taxation with Highest Honors and who regularly
handles cases dealing with TEFRA partnership issues. B represents A in an administrative proceeding involving TEFRA
partnership issues and subject to the provisions of this section. Assuming the taxpayer qualifies for an award of
reasonable administrative costs by meeting the requirements of section 7430, the amount of the award attributable
to the fees of B may not exceed the $75 per hour limitation (as adjusted for the cost of living), absent a special factor.
Under these facts alone, B is not a specially qualified representative since even extraordinary knowledge of the
tax laws does not constitute distinctive knowledge or a unique and specialized skill constituting a special factor.

Costs not incurred in an administrative proceeding.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Costs incurred in an administrative proceeding that are incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date,
and that are otherwise described in paragraph (b) of this section, are not recoverable unless they are reasonable
in both nature and amount. For example, costs normally included in the hourly rate of the representative by the custom
and usage of the representative's profession, when billed separately, are not recoverable separate and apart from
the representative's hourly rate. Such costs typically include costs such as secretarial and overhead expenses.
In contrast, costs which are normally billed separately may be reasonable administrative costs that may be recoverable
in addition to the representative's hourly rate. Therefore, necessary costs incurred for travel; expedited mail
delivery; messenger service; expenses while on travel; long distance telephone calls; and necessary copying fees
imposed by the Internal Revenue Service, any court, bank or other third party, when normally billed separately from
the representative's hourly rate, may be reasonable administrative costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special Rule for Expert Witness' Fees on Issue of Prevailing Market Rates. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, the taxpayer may initially establish a limited availability of
specially qualified representatives for the proceeding by submission of an affidavit signed by the taxpayer or by
the taxpayer's representative. The Internal Revenue Service may endeavor to rebut the affidavit submitted on this
issue by demonstrating either that a specially qualified representative was not necessary to represent the taxpayer
in the proceeding, that the taxpayer's representative is not a specially qualified representative or that the prevailing
rate for specially qualified representatives does not exceed $75 per hour (as adjusted for an increase in the cost
of living). Unless the Internal Revenue Service endeavors to demonstrate that the prevailing rate for specially
qualified representatives does not exceed $75 per hour (as adjusted for an increase in the cost of living), fees for
expert witnesses used to establish prevailing market rates are not included in the term reasonable administrative
costs.

then issues a notice of deficiency. Upon receiving the notice of deficiency, A discontinues A's administrative efforts
and files a petition with the Tax Court. A's costs incurred in connection with the preparation and filing of a petition
with the Tax Court are litigation costs and not reasonable administrative costs. Furthermore, A's costs incurred

 except that after A receives the notice of deficiency, A recontacts Appeals. Again, A's costs incurred before the
administrative proceeding date, the date of the notice of deficiency as set forth in &sect;301.7430&hyph;3(c)(3),
are not reasonable administrative costs. A's costs incurred in recontacting and working with Appeals after the issuance
of the notice of deficiency, and up to and including the time of filing of the petition, are reasonable administrative
costs. A's costs incurred in connection with the filing of a petition with the Tax Court are not reasonable administrative
costs because those costs are litigation costs. Similarly, A's costs incurred after the filing of the petition are
not reasonable administrative costs, as those are litigation costs.

(1) Establishes that the position of the Internal Revenue Service was not substantially justified;

Position of the Internal Revenue Service
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The position of the Internal Revenue Service in an administrative proceeding is the position taken by the Internal
Revenue Service as of the administrative proceeding date (as defined in &sect;301.7430&hyph;3(c)) or any date thereafter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The position of the Internal Revenue Service is substantially justified if it has a reasonable basis in both fact
and law. A significant factor in determining whether the position of the Internal Revenue Service is substantially
justified as of a given date is whether, on or before that date, the taxpayer has presented all relevant information
under the taxpayer's control and relevant legal arguments supporting the taxpayer's position to the appropriate
Internal Revenue Service personnel. The appropriate Internal Revenue Service personnel are personnel responsible
for reviewing the information or arguments, or personnel who would transfer the information or arguments in the normal
course of procedure and administration to the personnel who are responsible.

Exception
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the position of the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified with respect to some issues in the proceeding
and not substantially justified with respect to the remaining issues, any award of reasonable administrative costs
to the taxpayer may be limited to only reasonable administrative costs attributable to those issues with respect
to which the position of the Internal Revenue Service was not substantially justified. If the position of the Internal
Revenue Service was substantially justified for only a portion of the period of the proceeding and not substantially
justified for the remaining portion of the proceeding, any award of reasonable administrative costs to the taxpayer
may be limited to only reasonable administrative costs attributable to that portion during which the position of
the Internal Revenue Service was not substantially justified. Where an award of reasonable administrative costs
is limited to that portion of the administrative proceeding during which the position of the Internal Revenue Service
was not substantially justified, whether the position of the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified
is determined as of the date any cost is incurred.

Most significant issue or set of issues presented

Only in a multiple issue proceeding can a most significant issue or set of issues presented exist. However, not all
multiple issue proceedings contain a most significant issue or set of issues presented. An issue or set of issues constitutes
the most significant issue or set of issues presented if, despite involving a lesser dollar amount in the proceeding
than the other issue or issues, it objectively represents the most significant issue or set of issues for the taxpayer
or the Internal Revenue Service. This may occur because of the effect of the issue or set of issues on other transactions
or other taxable years of the taxpayer or related parties.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Internal Revenue Service, in the conduct of a correspondence examination of taxpayer A's individual income
tax return, requests substantiation from A of claimed medical expenses. A does not respond to the request and the Service
Center issues a notice of deficiency. After receiving the notice of deficiency, A presents sufficient information
and arguments to convince a revenue agent that the notice of deficiency is incorrect and that A owes no tax. The revenue
agent then closes the case showing no deficiency. Although A incurred costs after the issuance of the notice of deficiency,
A is unable to recover these costs because, as of the date these costs were incurred, A had not presented relevant information
under A's control and relevant legal arguments supporting A's position to the appropriate Internal Revenue Service
personnel. Accordingly, the position of the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified at the time the
costs were incurred.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the purchase of an ongoing business, taxpayer B obtains from the previous owner of the business a covenant not to
compete for a period of five years. On audit of B's individual income tax return for the year in which the business is
acquired, the Internal Revenue Service challenges the basis assigned to the covenant not to compete and a deduction
taken as a business expense for a seminar attended by B. Both parties agree that the covenant not to compete is amortizable
over a period of five years. However, the Internal Revenue Service asserts that the proper basis of the covenant is
$2X while the taxpayer asserts the basis is $4X. Thus, under the Internal Revenue Service's position, B is entitled
to a deduction of two-fifths $X in the year under audit and for each of the subsequent four years. B's position, however,
would result in a deduction of four-fifths $X for the year under audit and each of the subsequent four years. The deduction
for the seminar attended by B was reported on the return in question in the amount of $X. The Internal Revenue Service's
position is that the deduction for the seminar should be disallowed entirely. In the notice of deficiency, the Internal
Revenue Service determines adjustments of two-fifths $X (the difference between the Internal Revenue Service's
position of two-fifths $X and the reported four-fifths $X) regarding the basis of the covenant not to compete, and
$X resulting from the disallowance of the seminar expense. Thus, of the two adjustments determined for the year under
audit, that attributable to the disallowance of the seminar is larger than that attributable to the covenant not to
compete. However, due to the impact on the next succeeding four years, the covenant not to compete adjustment is objectively
the most significant issue to both B and the Internal Revenue Service.

Example 3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Collection Branch of a Service Center of the Internal Revenue Service determines in the matching process of various
Forms 1099 and W&hyph;2 that taxpayer C has not filed an individual income tax return. The Internal Revenue Service
sends notices to C requesting that C file an income tax return. C does not file a return, so the Service Center's Collection
Branch prepares a substitute for return pursuant to section 6020(b). The calculation is sent to C requesting that
C either sign the return pursuant to section 6020(a) or file a tax return prepared by C. C does not respond to the Internal
Revenue Service's request and the Service Center's Collection Branch issues a notice of deficiency based on information
in its possession. C does not file a petition with the Tax Court and does not pay the asserted deficiency. The Internal
Revenue Service then assesses the tax shown on the notice of deficiency and issues a notice and demand for tax pursuant
to section 6303. After receiving notice and demand, C contacts the Collection Branch and convinces Collection to
stay the collection process because C does not owe any taxes. The Collection Branch recommends that the Examination
Division examine the tax liability and make an adjustment to income. The Examination Division then redetermines
the tax and abates the assessment due to information and arguments presented by C at that time. The costs C incurred
before the Collection Branch are incurred in connection with an action taken by the Internal Revenue Service to collect
a tax. Therefore, these costs are incurred with respect to a collection action and not an administrative proceeding.
Accordingly, they are not recoverable as reasonable administrative costs. Costs incurred before the Examination
Division are reasonable administrative costs; however, C may not recover any reasonable administrative costs with
respect to the proceeding before the Examination Division because, as of the date the costs were incurred, C had not
previously presented all relevant information under C's control and all relevant legal arguments supporting C's
position to the Collection Branch or Examination Division personnel (the appropriate Internal Revenue Service
personnel under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;301.7430&hyph;5(c)), and thus, the position of the Internal Revenue Service was substantially justified

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This Treasury decision amends 27 CFR 70.92, in Part 70, Procedure and Administration. The amendments clarify the
period during which interest is allowed on taxpayer overpayments which are credited against other liabilities of
the same taxpayer for interest and certain additions to the tax. The amendments are necessary as a result of changes
to the law made by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. The regulations
affect all taxpayers who have overpayments credited against underpayments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This document contains amendments to the regulations on Procedure and Administration (27 CFR part 70) under &sect;6611
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC) to clarify the period during which interest is allowed on overpayments that
are credited against a taxpayer's liability for interest and certain additions to the tax. The amendments will conform
the regulations to &sect;344 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) (Pub. L. 97&hyph;248,
96 Stat. 635), and &sect;158 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA) (Pub. L. 98&hyph;369, 98 Stat. 696).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) applies &sect;6611 to the taxes it administers and enforces. The IRS published
a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on August 25, 1992 (57 FR 38457), and Treasury Decision 8524 (59 FR 10075) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on March 3, 1994, adopting final rules implementing the TEFRA and DEFRA amendments. ATF believes these regulations
are equally applicable to its tax collection activities and is adopting such regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Interest on Overpayments That Are Credited Against Interest on Underpayments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6611(a) of the IRC provides that interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment in respect of any internal
revenue tax at the overpayment rate established under &sect;6621.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;6402(a), the Secretary may credit any overpayment (including any interest allowed thereon) against
any liability imposed on the taxpayer under the IRC. Under &sect;6611(b)(1), interest is allowed on an overpayment
that is so credited from the date of the overpayment to the due date of the taxpayer's liability against which the overpayment
is credited. For purposes of this interest computation, a definition of the term ``due date'' is provided in &sect;70.92(d)
of the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, &sect;6601(f) provides that once an overpayment is credited to satisfy a taxpayer's liability, interest
no longer accrues on that liability. Section 344 of TEFRA added &sect;6622 of the IRC, which requires interest imposed
by the IRC to be compounded daily. The effect of &sect;6601(f) on the compounding requirement of &sect;6622 is that
once an overpayment is credited to satisfy the taxpayer's liability for interest, that credit cuts off any further
compounding of the interest (i.e., interest no longer accrues on the taxpayer's interest liability against which
the credit has been made).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, it is appropriate that no interest liability to the taxpayer accrues on the overpayment once the overpayment
is credited to satisfy the taxpayer's liability for interest. Thus, the regulations amend &sect;70.92(d)(2)(iii)
to clarify that interest ceases to accrue on any portion of an overpayment that is credited against the taxpayer's
liability for interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Interest on Overpayments That Are Credited Against Certain Additions to the Tax
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to DEFRA, interest only accrued on additions to the tax from the date of notice and demand, and then only if not
paid within 10 days from the date of notice and demand. In &sect;158 of DEFRA, Congress added &sect;6601(e)(2)(B)
to the IRC, requiring taxpayers to pay interest on certain additions to tax from the due date of the relevant return
(including any extensions) until the addition to the tax is paid. The number of additions to the tax that bear interest
from the due date of the return was increased by Congress in 1988 and again in 1989. This regulation amends &sect;70.92(d)(2)(iv)
to clarify that interest ceases to accrue on any portion of an overpayment that is credited against certain additions
to the tax for any period after the due date of the return (including extensions) to which the addition to the tax relates.

Prior Regulations Obsolete
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When ATF assumed responsibility for the collection and enforcement of taxes imposed under Subtitle E of the IRC, it
patterned many of its procedural regulations upon those already promulgated by the IRS. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, T.D. ATF&hyph;301, 55 Fed. Reg. 47608 (November 14, 1990); T.D. ATF&hyph;251, 52 Fed. Reg. 19314 (May 22, 1987).
However, since enactment of &sect;6622 of the IRC in TEFRA and &sect;6601(e)(2)(B) in DEFRA, the prior regulations
regarding interest and certain additions to tax have been obsolete. Accordingly, ATF has been computing interest
consistent with the statutory changes and these regulatory amendments acknowledge existing agency practice.

Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to a final regulatory flexibility analysis (5 U.S.C. 604)
are not applicable to this final rule because the agency was not required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking
under 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other law. A copy of this final rule has been submitted to the Administrator of the Small Business
Administration for comment on the impact of such regulation on small business, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 7805(f).

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action because (1) it will not have an annual effect
on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities;
(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the Presidents priorities, or the
principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this final rule merely adopts existing IRS procedural regulations regarding overpayment interest, it is
found to be unnecessary to issue this Treasury decision for notice and public procedure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)
or subject to the effective date limitation in 5 U.S.C. 553(d).

The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its implementing

 In the case of a credit against interest that accrues for any period ending prior to January 1, 1983, the due date is the
earlier of the date of assessment of such interest or December 31, 1982. In the case of a credit against interest that
accrues from any period beginning on or after December 31, 1982, such interest is due as it economically accrues on
a daily basis, rather than when it is assessed.

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone in Branford Harbor, around the fireworks barge GT 1000 located approximately
1200 feet southwest of Parker Memorial Park, Branford, CT, on July 1, 1994. This safety zone is needed to protect the
maritime community from possible navigation hazards associated with a fireworks display. Entry into this zone is
prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Long Island Sound.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As authorized by 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation. The Coast Guard
did not receive from the sponsor the final details concerning the event's exact location, which is essential information
for the purposes of establishing a safety zone in sufficient time to publish a NPRM. If the event, which is centered
around a national holiday and the Town of Branford's 350th birthday, were required to be postponed by publishing a
NPRM, the event would be cancelled. Publishing a NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to the public interest
since the fireworks display is for the benefit of the public.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The sponsor, The Town of Branford and American Legion Post 83, Branford, CT has requested that a 45 minute fireworks
display, launched from a floating platform, be permitted in the port of Branford in the vicinity of Parker Memorial
Park, Branford, CT. This zone is required to protect the maritime community from the dangers associated with this
fireworks display which is occurring over Branford Harbor. The safety zone covers all waters of Branford Harbor within
a 1200 foot radius of the fireworks barge GT 1000.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The event will last approximately 45 minutes. The area affected by this event receives infrequent commercial traffic.
Because of the short duration of the event and the extensive advisories which will be made, commercial entities will
be able to adjust to any disruptions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons addressed under the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation
to be minimal and certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone in Sippican Harbor, Marion, MA, during the Marion Fourth of
July fireworks display. The safety zone will cover the area of Sippican Harbor along the Silver Shell Beach shoreline
out to 400 yards east of the shoreline. The safety zone is necessary to protect pleasure craft and personnel aboard
these vessels from injury due to potential hazards associated with the fireworks.

 publication. Due to the date when this office received the application, there was not sufficient time to publish proposed
rules in advance of the event. Publishing a NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to public interest since the
fireworks display is for public viewing and is intended to celebrate the 4th of July holiday weekend.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 4, 1994, the town of Marion, Massachusetts, plans to sponsor a Fourth of July Fireworks display between the
hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. The fireworks will be launched from a site on Silver Shell Beach and will project onto the waters
of Sippican Harbor. Approximately 200 spectator boats are expected to attend this event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A safety zone is needed to prohibit spectator vessels from transiting or anchoring in the area of Sippican Harbor over
which the fireworks will be launched. The Coast Guard will establish this safety zone from the shoreline of Silver
Shell Beach (north end of safety zone is buoy C ``7'' and runs south to Spragues Cove), extending eastward 400 yards
into Sippican Harbor, between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on July 4, 1994. In the event of inclement weather, the rain
date will be July 5, 1994 at the same times.

Regulatory Evaluation

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
of DOT is unnecessary. These regulations will be in effect for only a short period, specifically for two hours on one
day. The entities most likely to be affected are pleasure craft wishing to view the fireworks from the water. These
vessels will still be able to view the fireworks from the water but will be required to do so at a distance more than 400
yards from the shoreline, which will not cause them undue hardship. The effect on commercial traffic is negligible
due to the minimal amount of commercial vessel traffic in that area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominate in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons outlined in the Regulatory Evaluation,
the Coast Guard expects the impact to be minimal on all entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C.
605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone in Onset Harbor, Onset, MA, on July 9, 1994 during the Onset
Fire Department Centennial Celebration. While this safety zone is in effect, no vessel traffic will be allowed into
or out of Sunset Cove. This safety zone is necessary to protect pleasure craft and personnel aboard these vessels from
injury due to potential hazards associated with the fireworks.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 9, 1994, the town of Onset, Massachusetts, plans to sponsor a Onset Fire Works Centennial Celebration between
the hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. Approximately 200 spectator boats are expected to attend this event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A safety zone is needed to prohibit spectator vessels from transiting or anchoring in the area over which the fireworks
will be launched. The safety zone will include all waters from the Shell Point Beach south to buoy C ``1'' then southwest
to a danger buoy at position 41 degrees 44.13
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; North and 70 degrees 39.83
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; West then northwest to the mouth of Sunset Cove, between the hours of 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. on July 9, 1994. While
this safety zone is in effect, no vessel traffic will be allowed into or out of Sunset Cove.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
of DOT is unnecessary. These regulations will be in effect for only a short period, specifically for one hour on one
day. The entities most likely to be affected are pleasure craft wishing to view the fireworks from the water. These
vessels will still be able to view the fireworks from the water but will be required to do so at a distance more than 300
yards from the staging area, which will not cause them undue hardship. The effect on commercial traffic is negligible
due to the minimal amount of commercial vessel traffic in that area.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominate in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons outlined in the Regulatory Evaluation,
the Coast Guard expects the impact to be minimal on all entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C.
605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Postal Service regulations concerning the disposition of stolen mail matter and property acquired by the Postal
Inspection Service for use as evidence are published in title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as part 946.
Section 946.11, disposition of property declared abandoned, is amended to authorize the Chief Postal Inspector
to delegate authority to approve the sharing of property declared abandoned with federal, state, or local law enforcement
agencies. This will make section 946.11 consistent with the other sections of part 946.

, decided May 2, 1994), the Supreme Court held that ash generated by certain municipal waste-to-energy facilities
that burn household wastes alone or in combination with nonhazardous wastes from industrial and commercial sources
is not exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). When the
decision takes effect, persons who generate such ash will need to determine whether it is a hazardous waste under Subtitle
C of RCRA. Ash that is hazardous will need to be managed in compliance with all applicable hazardous waste regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the Court's decision, EPA is today announcing that there has been substantial confusion as to when the
owners and operators of facilities managing such ash were required to file applications for RCRA hazardous waste
permits. EPA is exercising its authority under 40 CFR 270.10(e)(2) to extend the deadline for filing permit applications.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also is announcing today that it considers ash from these combustion facilities to be a newly identified waste
for purposes of the land disposal restrictions under sections 3004(d)-(m) of RCRA. Current land disposal restrictions
do not apply. Rather, the Agency has a duty to promulgate ash-specific restrictions 6 months from the date of today's
document. All other hazardous waste regulations will apply to hazardous ash when the decision takes effect.

, decided May 2, 1994). The Court held that this provision does not exempt ash generated at resource recovery facilities
burning household wastes and nonhazardous commercial wastes (hereafter ``waste-to-energy facilities'') from
the hazardous waste requirements of Subtitle C of RCRA. The Court also held that Section 3001(i) terminated a 1980
regulatory exemption for ash generated at waste-to-energy facilities that burn only household wastes. The opinion
requires EPA to revise its prior position that both types of ash were exempt from hazardous waste regulation. It abruptly
ends nearly a decade of controversy over the regulatory status of ash from these facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of this decision, ash from waste-to-energy facilities has the same status as other solid wastes. Persons
who generate such wastes must determine whether that waste is a hazardous waste under EPA's hazardous waste identification
rules at 40 CFR part 261. Since EPA has not listed ash as a hazardous waste, generators must determine whether ash exhibits
any of the characteristics of hazardous waste at 40 CFR 261.21&hyph;.24. Ash that exhibits a characteristic must
be managed in compliance with Subtitle C requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained below, the regulatory status of ash has been the subject of confusion for several years. EPA's action
today responds by giving owners and operators of facilities that manage ash that is determined to be characteristically
hazardous a reasonable opportunity to obtain interim status by applying for a RCRA hazardous waste permit. Without
this opportunity, persons managing hazardous ash would be out of compliance with RCRA's permit requirements and
face potentially significant civil and criminal penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this notice EPA is also announcing that it will consider ash that is characteristically hazardous to be a ``newly
identified'' waste under the land disposal restrictions. EPA needs time to determine what treatment standards would
be appropriate. By considering such ash to be a newly identified waste under the land disposal restrictions, EPA will
have an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of the existing standards and, if necessary, develop new ash-specific
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that all other applicable Subtitle C regulations will apply to ash on the date that the Court's decision takes
effect. See the discussion of state authorization below for assistance in determining when the Court's decision
will affect particular facilities. The Agency interprets the Court's decision to cut-off the exemption for waste
management at waste-to-energy facilities at the point that ash is generated. Subsequent management of hazardous
ash on-site is subject to regulation under Subtitle C.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Combustion of municipal solid waste, particularly through waste-to-energy facilities, can be an important component
of a local government's waste management practices. As of 1990, approximately 196 million tons of municipal solid
waste were generated annually in the U.S., 16 percent of which (32 million tons) was combusted. The states with the
greatest municipal waste combustion capacity are Florida, New York and Massachusetts. There are approximately
150 municipal waste combustors in the U.S., 80 percent of which are waste-to-energy facilities. The remaining 20
percent incinerate waste without recovering energy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 25 percent (by weight) of the waste that is combusted remains as ash, amounting to around eight million
tons of municipal waste combustor ash generated annually. Generally, these combustion facilities generate two
basic types of ash_bottom ash and air pollution control residuals, commonly referred to as ``fly ash.'' Bottom ash
collects at the bottom of the combustion unit and comprises approximately 75&hyph;80% of the total ash. Fly ash collects
in the air pollution control devices that ``clean'' the gases produced during the combustion of the waste and comprises
around 20&hyph;25% of the total. Based on several analytical studies, fly ash generally contains the highest concentrations
of inorganic chemical constituents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies also show that ash (usually fly ash) has sometimes exhibited EPA's Toxicity Characteristic (``TC''). Typically,
ash that ``fails'' the TC leaches lead or cadmium above levels of concern. Because a number of factors can influence
whether ash passes or fails the TC (e.g., the nature of the incoming waste stream, the type of combustion unit, the nature
of the air pollution control device and the ash sampling location), EPA cannot predict an overall failure rate for
ash from municipal waste combustors.

RCRA requires any person treating, storing or disposing of hazardous waste to obtain a permit or a pre-permit authorization
called ``interim status.'' Section 3005; 40 CFR 270.1(b). To qualify for interim status a facility must meet criteria
set out in RCRA section 3005(e), which include filing a permit application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When EPA promulgates RCRA rules subjecting a new group of facilities to hazardous waste permitting requirements,
the permit regulations provide 6 months for the filing of part A of the permit application. 40 CFR 270.10 (e). EPA routinely
publishes in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the specific permit deadline for persons regulated by the new rules. See 270.10 (e), note. Section 270.10(e)(2) provides
that EPA can extend the date for permit applications by

 notice if it finds that there has been ``substantial confusion'' as to whether the owner or operator was required to
file a permit application and the confusion was due to ambiguities in EPA's regulations. For the reasons explained
below, EPA today is exercising its discretion to extend the submission dates for part A permit applications for facilities
treating, storing and disposing of ash from waste-to-energy facilities that exhibits a characteristic of hazardous
waste.

B. Regulatory History of Waste-to-Energy Ash
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1980, EPA promulgated a rule exempting household wastes from all RCRA requirements for hazardous wastes. 40 CFR
261.4(b)(1). EPA interpreted this exemption to extend to residuals from the treatment of household wastes, including
ash from the combustion of household wastes. The exemption, however, did not address ash from the combustion of household
wastes combined with nonhazardous commercial and industrial wastes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1984 Congress added to RCRA a new Section 3001(i), entitled ``Clarification of Household Waste Exemption.'' This
provision addressed waste-to-energy facilities burning household wastes and nonhazardous commercial and industrial
wastes to produce energy. In July 1985, EPA promulgated a rule that codified this provision. In the preamble accompanying
this rule, EPA announced that it interpreted the statute and the rule to exempt the facilities_but not their ash_from
Subtitle C, 50 FR 28702, 28725&hyph;26 (July 15, 1985). EPA did not publish any statement informing owners of facilities
managing ash of any deadline for obtaining RCRA permits.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the late 1980's, various EPA officials began taking the position that Section 3001(i) could be interpreted to exempt
ash from Subtitle C. They also expressed the opinion that ash could be managed safely in nonhazardous waste disposal
facilities. The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed citizen suits in two separate U.S. District Courts to enforce
the 1985 interpretation of the statute against two specific waste-to-energy facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also in the late 1980's, Congress considered a number of bills that would have explicitly exempted ash from Subtitle
C requirements. In November 1990, Congress enacted an uncodified amendment to the Clean Air Act prohibiting EPA from
regulating ash as a hazardous waste under Section 3001 of RCRA for a period of two years. Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, Pub.L. No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these events, a number of states authorized to implement Subtitle C programs in lieu of EPA began treating
ash from waste-to-energy facilities as exempt. Some interpreted their own regulations virtually identical to Section
3001(i). Others promulgated specific ash exemptions. Many of these specific exemptions were accompanied by detailed
regulations for the management of ash as a nonhazardous waste. Consistent with the evolving federal position on the
regulation of ash, EPA took no action affecting these state programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in September 1992, just before the expiration of the Clean Air Act ash ``moratorium,'' EPA Administrator
William Reilly signed a memorandum announcing that the Agency now interpreted Section 3001(i) to exempt ash from
waste-to-energy facilities burning household wastes and nonhazardous wastes from Subtitle C requirements. This
memorandum also announced that EPA believed that ash could be disposed of safely in landfills meeting new standards
for municipal solid waste facilities promulgated in 1991 and codified at 40 CFR part 258.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA finds that the events above have created substantial confusion about the status of ash under the rule EPA wrote
to codify the exemption in Section 3001(i). Although EPA's 1980 and 1985 preambles indicated that there was no exemption
for ash from combined sources, later events suggested that ash was not regulated. Persons may have relied on the two
District Court decisions, the 1990 ash moratorium, or the 1992 Reilly memorandum to conclude that Section 3001(i)
and 40 CFR 261.4(b)(2) were ambiguous about the status of ash from combined sources. They could quite reasonably have
concluded that they could manage ash from combined sources without obtaining hazardous waste permits. If EPA did
not act to extend the Part A deadline, however, these facilities would be unable to obtain interim status because the
Court's action is not a statutory or regulatory change establishing a new period for obtaining interim status under
RCRA section 3005(e). Such facilities would have to cease handling hazardous ash until EPA took final action on their
completed permit applications_a process that typically takes several years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 270.10(e)(2) was written to prevent such harsh results. EPA is today invoking its authority to provide a reasonable
opportunity for persons managing combined ash to satisfy RCRA's permitting requirements. Applying the substantial
confusion approach to facilities managing this ash is consistent with previous precedents. See, e.g., 52 FR 34779&hyph;81
(Sept. 15, 1987) (notice of substantial confusion for big city cement kilns).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons handling ash from the combustion of 100% household waste could have relied with even greater justification
on the Agency's 1980 interpretation of the household waste exemption to handle such waste without a hazardous waste
permit. They are also entitled to an opportunity to satisfy the permit requirement. Since they are becoming subject
to Subtitle C without the enactment of a statute or the promulgation of a rule, they do not technically qualify for the
normal 6 months provided for persons newly subject to Subtitle C regulation. See section 40 CFR 270.10(e)(1). Section
270.10(e)(1)(ii), which provides 30 days for filing a Part A after a facility ``first becomes subject to the [Subtitle
C] standards'' could apply to these facilities. EPA, however, interprets this provision to apply to facilities whose
own actions subject them to Subtitle C rather than to facilities affected by regulatory events. (An example would
be a generator that exceeded the small quantity generator monthly waste generation limit.) See generally 45 FR 76630,
76633 (November 19, 1980). Consequently, EPA believes the ``substantial confusion'' approach is also appropriate
for persons who manage 100% household waste. Moreover, it reduces confusion by establishing a single deadline for
both types of ash from waste-to-energy facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, EPA today establishes that facilities that are handling hazardous ash from waste-to-energy facilities
that wish to continue to do so may file Part A applications anytime before December 7, 1994. See the discussion of state
authorization below for guidance on where to request and submit an application.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another statutory requirement for obtaining interim status is the filing of any notification required under section
3010(a) of RCRA. Under section 3010, EPA may require all persons that handle hazardous wastes_including generators
and transporters_to notify EPA of the location of their activities within 90 days of the promulgation of a new rule
identifying additional characteristics or listing a waste. This provision does not literally apply because EPA
is not promulgating or revising a rule. However, failure to satisfy it could cloud a facility's claim that it obtained
interim status. In order to prevent this result, EPA is exercising its discretion to waive filing of section 3010 notifications
by facilities managing ash from resource recovery facilities. EPA notes that persons who manage ash will be required
to obtain EPA identification numbers in the near future. This process will furnish the information that the notifications
would have provided.

IV. Land Disposal Restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The RCRA land disposal restrictions (LDRs) prohibit land disposal of hazardous wastes unless those wastes are first
treated to substantially reduce toxicity or mobility of the hazardous constituents in the wastes so as to minimize
threats to human health and the environment. RCRA sections 3004 (d), (e), (g), (m). The restrictions specify dates
on which particular groups of wastes are prohibited from land disposal unless they are treated. RCRA sections 3004
(d), (e), (g). For wastes which are ``newly identified or listed'' after November 8, 1984, EPA must promulgate treatment
standards within 6 months of the date of identification or listing. RCRA section 3004(g)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 1, 1990, EPA promulgated treatment standards for constituents in wastes identified as hazardous under the
``EP toxicity'' characteristic, the predecessor to the current TC. 55 FR 22520. The treatment standards for metal
constituents are levels identical to the EP toxicity standards themselves. 40 CFR 268.41. (EPA notes that it must
revise these standards under

EPA,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 976 F.2d 2 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (the ``Third Third'' decision).) Persons generating wastes that fail the current TC test
must determine whether their TC wastes exceed these EP levels, and, if they do, comply with the treatment standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA, however, believes that ash from waste-to-energy facilities is ``newly identified'' for purposes of the land
disposal restrictions. Although technically ash would be identified as hazardous under the existing TC rather than
a new characteristic rule, the Supreme Court's decision is bringing ash into the Subtitle C system for the first time
(for ash from 100% household waste) or returning it to the system after a period of uncertainty and actual legislative
exemption (for ash from combined sources). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA dealt with a similar situation in a 1990 LDR rule. In that notice, EPA interpreted section 3004(g)(4) for mineral
processing wastes brought into RCRA by a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
holding that EPA had improperly considered them to be exempt from Subtitle C under the statute's ``Bevill amendment''.
(The mineral processing wastes also sometimes exceed the TC and EP toxicity levels for metals.) In that notice, EPA
explained that section 3004(g)(4) is ambiguous as to whether it applies to wastes brought into the system after 1984
due to regulatory reinterpretation. See 55 FR 22667 (June 1, 1990). EPA determined that it was preferable to read section
3004(g)(4) to include such wastes because that reading was more consistent with the policy goals that prompted Congress
to establish a separate schedule for new wastes in the first place: the need to study such wastes separately to set appropriate
treatment standards, and the established priority of subjecting older wastes to the land ban first. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also noted that, before it developed specific treatment standards for the newly-identified mineral processing
wastes, the wastes could be regulated under existing treatment standards for EP toxicity metals. EPA determined
that it would not be appropriate to apply those treatment standards, however, because it had not analyzed and tested
the wastes to determine whether those standards would meet the statuary requirements of reduced toxicity and mobility.
Id. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ash from 100% household waste clearly fits this precedent. It, too, is being regulated under Subtitle C for the first
time as the result of a court decision narrowing an Agency interpretation of an existing Subtitle C exemption. Further,
as explained in more detail below, EPA needs to determine whether exiting EP toxicity treatment standards will meet
land treatment standard requirements for this ash. Accordingly, EPA interprets section 3004(g)(4) to apply to this
ash. EPA will not apply the current treatment standards for the EP toxicity characteristic to ash which is identified
as hazardous under the TC. Section 3004(g)(4) will require EPA to promulgate treatment standards for this ash within
6 months of the date of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ash from combined sources is not entering Subtitle C jurisdiction for the first time_it was not exempt under EPA's
original household waste exemption, and was not originally viewed as exempt under section 3001(i). Nevertheless,
EPA believes that it would be appropriate and consistent with the goals of the LDRs to view it as a newly identified waste
under section 3004(g)(4). Section 3004(g)(4) is ambiguous as to wastes reentering Subtitle C after several years
of confusion and two years of clear statutory exemption. Moreover, EPA has not studied ash to determine what treatment
standards would meet the requirements of Section 3004(m) of RCRA, and in fact is reviewing what the appropriate treatment
standards are for all of the wastes with metal constituents exhibiting the Toxicity Characteristic. 58 FR 48116 (Sept.
14, 1993). Congress' priority scheme for land disposal restrictions directs EPA to promulgate standards for post-1984
wastes in chronological order. If EPA were required to immediately determine whether the current EP toxicity standards
for ash were appropriate, it would have to postpone work on treatment standards for new listings and a new characteristic
promulgated several years prior to the City of Chicago

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For these reasons, EPA will also consider ash from combined sources to be newly identified for purposes of the land
disposal restrictions. Furthermore, it will not apply the existing treatment standards for EP toxicity. As a result
of this decision, Section 3004(g)(4) requires EPA to promulgate treatment standards for combined ash within 6 months
of the date of this notice.

V. Other Subtitle C Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is not extending compliance dates for any other aspect of the hazardous waste regulations. Facilities generating,
transporting, or treating, storing or disposing of hazardous ash must, as a matter of federal law, comply with the
substantive requirements of 40 CFR parts 260&hyph;270 on the effective date of the Court's decision. (See the discussion
of state authorization below to determine when the decision takes effect under authorized state RCRA programs.)
EPA reminds generators, transporters and treatment, storage and disposal facilities that they must promptly obtain
EPA identification numbers. See, e.g., 40 CFR 262.12. EPA intends to issue an implementation strategy in the near
future that will provide additional information on complying with other RCRA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate compliance with Subtitle C, EPA has developed draft guidance for the sampling of ash from waste-to-energy
facilities. EPA has already released this draft. Interested parties may obtain a copy by calling the RCRA/Superfund
Hotline, Office of Solid Waste, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, (800)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA notes that by following certain waste management practices, some facilities may not need interim status or a RCRA
permit. For example, under federal regulations, generators of hazardous ash may accumulate and treat ash onsite
in tanks or containers for up to 90 days without obtaining hazardous waste permits under 40 CFR 262.34. See also 51 FR

1. General Principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3006(b) of RCRA allows states to obtain authorization to implement state hazardous waste programs in lieu
of federal law. To obtain authorization, a state must show that its program is equivalent to the Federal program. EPA
interprets this requirement to mean that state laws and rules must be no less stringent than federal requirements.
Section 3009, however, expressly allows states the option of establishing more stringent requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forty-eight states and territories are now authorized for all of the RCRA requirements established prior to November
1984 (the RCRA ``base program''). In these states, the state's definition of hazardous waste_including any exemptions_operates
in lieu of the federal definition. Changes to the federal definition do not automatically revise independently promulgated
state regulations. Rather, the states are required to revise their programs and submit the revisions to EPA for approval.
The revision does not take effect under federal law until EPA approves the revision. As explained below, in a few of
these states, the Court's decision may not take effect on its federal law effective date. EPA believes that there are
very few states in this category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the Court's decision does eliminate an exemption for ash, the hazardous waste characteristic most likely to
apply to ash is the TC as determined by the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (``TCLP'') promulgated by
EPA in 1990. This rule was promulgated under one of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (``HSWA''). Section
3006(g) provides that rules promulgated under HSWA take effect in all states at the same time, displacing state rules
unless the state rules are more stringent. EPA implements the new HSWA rule until the state adopts an equivalent provision,
submits it to EPA, and obtains EPA approval. 50 FR 28728&hyph;30. (July 15, 1985). The TC and TCLP displaced the 1980
EP toxicity characteristic and leaching procedure. The EP, however, also remains in effect as a matter of state law
in many states. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixteen states are now authorized for the TC and TCLP (see list in Table 1). EPA continues to implement the TC and the
TCLP in the remaining states. EPA takes the position that, where it implements the TC, it uses federal permitting procedures.
Consequently, EPA will implement the permit deadline extension announced today in all states where it implements
the TC. Owners and operators in those states would file Part A applications with EPA Regional Offices. (See list in
Table 2.) Where a state has been authorized to implement the TC, however, state permit procedures are in effect. Today's
deadline extension is not in effect in those states. Moreover, since the extension makes permit requirements less
stringent, states are not required to adopt equivalent extensions. If any of these states chooses to provide equivalent
relief, owners and operators would file permit applications with the state agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To summarize, in order to determine the impact of today's action, persons handling ash must determine (1) the impact
of the Court's decision on the RCRA program in each state (primarily an issue of whether a state's base program contains
an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
authorized 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
exemption for ash) and (2) whether the entity authorized to implement the TC and TCLP has extended its permit deadline.

a. Unauthorized states.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the eight states and territories where EPA implements all portions of the RCRA program (see Table 1 for a list of these
states and territories), including the base program, the Court's decision will eliminate EPA's interpretative
ash exemption on the opinion's effective date. Since EPA implements the TC, the permit deadline extension will take
effect today. Owners and operators of facilities who wish to obtain interim status to manage hazardous ash may file
Part A applications with EPA Regional Offices. (See list in Table 2.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
(i) States with no ash exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since states may maintain more stringent RCRA programs, some states may never have exempted ash from hazardous waste
requirements. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
City of Chicago
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision has no impact in these states. No permit deadline extensions are needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) States with unauthorized ash exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA knows that, during the years of confusion over the status of ash, some states exempted ash from their Subtitle C
programs. Most of these states, however, did not submit these provisions to EPA for authorization reviews. Although
they arguably may have made the state programs less stringent than the federal program, EPA would have taken no action
to force the states to eliminate them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Effect of court's decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of these states adopted provisions resembling 3001(i) and interpreted them to exempt ash. Whether the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
City of Chicago 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decision requires these states to abandon these interpretations is an issue of state law that can be answered authoritatively
only by state officials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other states promulgated rules under their solid waste authorities that established ash-specific management standards
that implicitly_or explicitly_transferred ash management from their hazardous waste programs to their solid waste
programs. The status of these provisions is again an issue of state law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Effect of today's deadline extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the state never obtained authorization for its exemption for ash, its authorized program still regulates ash
as a hazardous waste. The regulated community, however, could have been confused about the status of ash, so the relief
provided by the deadline extension would be appropriate. Whether or not the extension is in effect, however, depends
on which entity is authorized to implement the TC. As explained above, where EPA implements the TC, it will apply today's
notice. Where states implement the TC, today's notice cannot operate to revise state permit rules. The state would
need to determine whether it wanted to provide equivalent relief. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Requirements for program revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the court's decision, states with unauthorized ash exemptions now have state law requirements that
are less stringent than the federal Subtitle C program. EPA is today notifying those states that they must revise their
laws and regulations to eliminate the less stringent provisions. Although EPA is not today initiating any withdrawals
of state programs, it advises states to take timely action to eliminate their ash exemptions. Since these provisions
are not part of states' authorized RCRA programs, no Subtitle C program revisions will be necessary. Rather, EPA advises
states to notify Regional Offices informally by letter when they have eliminated their exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Where to file Part A applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where EPA implements the TC, owners and operators must file Part A applications with the appropriate EPA Regional
Office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where a state that is authorized to implement the TC decides to extend the filing deadline, owners and operators must
file with the state hazardous waste agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) States with authorized ash exemptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA may have authorized a few ash exemptions during the late 1980's and early 1990's. EPA has not found any such authorization
during a limited review prior to the publication of this emergency notice. Consequently, EPA believes that there
are very few states in this category. Nevertheless, in case such states exist, EPA is explaining their obligations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Effect of court decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether or not the decision affected the state law or rule that EPA authorized is a state law issue. State officials
will need to make that determination. If a state determines that its state provision is still in effect, both the state
law and the authorized RCRA program will continue to exempt ash until such time as the state revises its program and
obtains EPA approval for its revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Effect of today's permit deadline extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If ash is still exempt under both state law and the authorized program, no permits are currently required. Today's
filing date extension would not take effect. As explained in (D.) below, in some cases EPA will announce an extension
when it approves a revision eliminating an ash exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) State program revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where ash exemptions remain in effect, state programs will be less stringent than the federal program. Formal state
program revisions, including notice and comment rulemaking, will be required under 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2)(ii). The
deadline for these revisions will be July 1, 1995 under 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2)(ii). An additional year is available where
states must make statutory changes. 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2)(v). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Where to file Part A applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time that the state receives EPA authorization for the revision that eliminates its ash exemption, if EPA is
still implementing the TC, it will make a finding of substantial confusion and extend the Part A deadline for that state.
Owners and operators desiring interim status will need to file applications with the appropriate EPA Regional Office.
EPA will not be able to provide this relief where a state is authorized to implement the TC. Those states must determine
whether they want to extend permit deadlines. If they do, owners and operators wishing to obtain interim status will
need to file applications with the appropriate state agency.

B. Land Disposal Restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The LDRs are HSWA rules initially implemented by EPA. Moreover, EPA has established that it will not delegate its authority
to set treatment standards to states. EPA views determinations linked to the need for and scope of treatment standards
as similarly nondelegable. This includes today's interpretation that ash from waste-to-energy facilities is a
newly identified waste under section 3004(g)(4). This interpretation is effective in all states, including those
authorized to implement the delegable portions of the land disposal restrictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Good Cause Finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 270.10(e)(2) does not require notice and comment rulemaking for substantial confusion notices. Rather,
it simply requires EPA to publish a ``notice'' in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. To the extent that this notice is a rulemaking for the purposes of section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act
(APA), EPA believes that it has ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(3)(B) of the APA to extend the permit application
deadline without prior notice and opportunity for comment. First, EPA believes that its determination regarding
the existence of regulatory confusion is an ``interpretative rule'' for which notice and comment is not required
under section 553(b)(3)(A) of the APA. It clarifies and explains existing law rather than creating new duties. Moreover,
the establishment of a due date for Part A permit applications is a procedural rule also exempt from notice and comment
under section 553(b)(3)(A) of the APA. The effect of establishing this new date is that EPA will not take enforcement
action for operation without a RCRA permit against a facility that submits its application in compliance with this
notice and that meets the other conditions of RCRA section 3005(e). Finally, EPA views the issues of whether confusion
existed and whether it was ``substantial'' as subjects on which comment would not be useful and would not serve the
public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's findings concerning the land disposal restrictions are also ``interpretative rules'' exempt from notice
and comment requirements. They provide EPA's views on the scope of section 3004(g)(4) of RCRA. Moreover, EPA would
have good cause to eliminate notice and comment even if these determinations are regarded as legislative rules. The
land disposal restrictions would take effect for ash approximately 25 days after the Court issued its opinion. It
would be impossible for facilities managing ash to come into compliance with the restrictions in that short time.
See 55 FR 22521 (June 1, 1990) (Third Third LDR rule_EPA provides 90 days for persons managing wastes subject to new
treatment standards to come into compliance.) The Court's decision thus creates an emergency justifying use of the
``good cause'' exemption under section 553(b)(3)(B) of the APA.

A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because it involves novel policy issues arising out of legal mandates. However, OMB waived review of this
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires the Agency to prepare and make available for public comment, a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes
the impact of a proposed or final rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental
jurisdictions). No regulatory flexibility analysis is required if the Administrator certifies that the rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ruling of the Supreme Court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
City of Chicago 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
will result in additional costs for waste management facilities and some of those costs will be borne by small entities.
The Agency does not have estimates of those costs. Today's rule extends the date by which affected facilities must
submit a Part A permit application. This action will lower the costs to small entities that will have to comply with
the Court's ruling. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605b, I certify that this regulation will not have a substantial
impact on small entities.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule provides that operators may not transport a hazardous liquid in a steel interstate pipeline constructed
before January 8, 1971, a steel interstate offshore gathering line constructed before August 1, 1977, or a steel intrastate
pipeline constructed before October 21, 1985, unless the pipeline has been pressure tested hydrostatically according
to current standards or operates at 80 percent or less of a qualified prior test or operating pressure. In addition,
this final rule creates a comparable requirement for carbon dioxide pipelines constructed before July 12, 1991,
except for production field distribution lines in rural areas. The purpose of this final rule is to ensure that the
affected pipelines have an adequate safety margin between their maximum operating pressure and test pressure. This
safety margin is essential to prevention of particular kinds of pipeline accidents.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any steel pipeline may contain hidden physical defects that result from the manufacture or transportation of pipe
and from pipeline construction. Over the operational life of the pipeline, new physical defects can be created by
external forces acting on the pipeline. When a physical defect is large enough, it can cause the pipeline to fail during
operation. Also, during pipeline operation, internal or environmental stresses can cause smaller defects to grow
and become large enough to cause the pipeline to fail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adequate pressure testing can disclose hidden physical defects in a pipeline. Pressure testing involves raising
a pipeline's internal pressure above its maximum operating pressure (MOP) for a time sufficient for leaks to develop
from defects. A test that is adequate in pressure level and duration will disclose physical defects that are large
enough to cause pipeline failure during operation. In addition, an adequate pressure test will provide a proven margin
of safety against failure during operation from the growth of defects.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Line pipe research has demonstrated that 125 percent of MOP is the minimum test level adequate to protect hazardous
liquid pipelines against failure in operation from physical defects. A pressure test at this level for a sufficient
duration provides a 25 percent proven margin of safety against failures caused by the growth of physical defects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;195.302, new steel pipelines must be pressure tested to provide at least a 25 percent proven margin of
safety. Hazardous liquid pipelines must be pressure tested hydrostatically, but carbon dioxide pipelines may be
tested pneumatically, using inert gas or carbon dioxide as the test medium (see &sect;195.306). Portions of existing
steel pipelines that are replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed are also subject to this pressure testing requirement.
The requirement became effective as follows for pipelines subject to part 195: January 8, 1971, for interstate pipelines
transporting hazardous liquid (35 FR 17183); August 1, 1977, for interstate offshore gathering lines transporting
hazardous liquid (41 FR 34039); October 21, 1985, for intrastate pipelines transporting hazardous liquid (50 FR
15895); and July 12, 1991, for pipelines transporting carbon dioxide in a supercritical state (56 FR 26922). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 195.302 also requires that certain older pipelines transporting highly volatile liquids (HVL) must have
at least a 25 percent proven margin of safety. These pipelines are onshore steel interstate pipelines constructed
before January 8, 1971, and onshore steel intrastate pipelines constructed before October 21, 1985. If an older HVL
pipeline has not been hydrostatically tested to part 195 standards, &sect;195.302(b) permits operators to provide
the proven margin of safety either by hydrostatic testing or by establishing the pipeline's MOP under &sect;195.406(a)(5)
at 80 percent or less of a qualified prior test or operating pressure. Establishing MOP under &sect;195.406(a)(5)
and hydrostatic testing to part 195 standards provide equivalent proven margins of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Apart from these older HVL pipelines, the 25 percent proven margin-of-safety requirement does not apply to older
pipelines constructed before the dates (stated above) the pressure testing requirement went into effect for new
pipelines. Consequently, many older pipelines subject to part 195 are not operated with a minimum 25 percent proven
margin of safety. It was not common industry practice to test to at least 125 percent of MOP or to test to that pressure
level for a sufficient duration.

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Older pipelines that do not have a minimum 25 percent proven margin of safety are more susceptible to failures from
defect growth in service than pipelines that meet the part 195 pressure testing requirements. They are also more susceptible
to failure from defect growth during instances of overpressure permitted by &sect;195.406(b). This increased potential
for failure is prevalent in pipelines made of pre-1970 electric resistance welded (ERW) pipe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA's pipeline accident statistics show the benefits of requiring older pipelines to have a minimum 25 percent proven
margin of safety. September 15, 1985, was the date by which onshore interstate pipelines constructed before January
8, 1971, that transport HVL had to have a minimum 25 percent proven margin of safety. By that date these pipelines had
to have been pressure tested hydrostatically to part 195 requirements or operated at 80 percent or less of a qualified
prior test or operating pressure. To learn the effect of the 25-percent-safety-margin requirement, RSPA compared
the period for which accident data were available before the requirement was adopted with the period from September
15, 1985, through December 31, 1989. Onshore HVL interstate pipelines had a 68 percent lower rate of failure from material
defects and corrosion during the latter period. RSPA attributed this dramatic drop in failure rate to the 25-percent-safety-margin
requirement imposed on the older onshore HVL interstate pipelines. In addition, RSPA concluded that operators could
achieve a comparable reduction in failure rate on all other older pipelines subject to part 195 that lack an adequate
proven margin of safety.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To bring about this reduction in failure rate, RSPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) (Docket PS&hyph;121;
56 FR 23538, May 22, 1991) on testing older pipelines. The notice proposed to extend the part 195 requirement for a proven
margin of safety to all pipelines that are covered by part 195 but excepted from the testing standards in subpart E of
part 195. These pipelines are (1) hazardous liquid steel interstate pipelines constructed before January 8, 1971,
other than onshore HVL pipelines; (2) hazardous liquid steel interstate offshore gathering lines constructed before
August 1, 1977; (3) hazardous liquid steel intrastate pipelines constructed before October 21, 1985, other than
onshore HVL pipelines; and (4) carbon dioxide steel pipelines constructed before July 12, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, RSPA also discussed the unique safety problems with longitudinal seams on ERW pipe manufactured before
1970. RSPA proposed that operators give pipelines with a predominance of pre-1970 ERW pipe priority in scheduling
tests. Under this proposal, testing of pipelines known to have more than 50 percent (by mileage) of pre-1970 ERW pipe
would have to be completed within 4.5 years after a final rule is published. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thirteen persons submitted written comments on the NPRM: 11 pipeline operators, the American Petroleum Institute
(API), and the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI). A discussion of the significant comments and their disposition
in development of the final rules follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
General Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most commenters discussed specific problems they anticipated in carrying out the rulemaking proposals, without
objecting to them outright. DOI favored adoption of the proposals, especially for offshore pipelines. One commenter,
a major operator of hazardous liquid pipelines, clearly supported the proposed rules. A few other operators hedged
their apparent agreement with the proposals by suggesting RSPA allow smart pigs as a substitute for pressure testing
or MOP reduction, an issue discussed separately below. Another operator asserted that RSPA should require pressure
testing or MOP reduction only where risk is heightened by factors such as adverse leak or corrosion history, environmental
sensitivity, or high population. Only two operators strongly objected to the proposals. But, they aimed their remarks
at carbon dioxide pipelines, and as discussed below, the final rule addresses their concerns. By and large, RSPA believes
the commenters supported the objective of the notice concerning older untested or inadequately tested hazardous
liquid pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limiting the application of the proposed rules to older pipelines that have an increased risk of failure or that are
near environmentally sensitive areas or a large number of people does not sufficiently address safety concerns.
The problem of the growth of defects is common among all pipelines regulated by part 195. It is not limited to pipelines
that are in a worrisome condition or a high risk location. For such problems, RSPA believes that all pipelines should
provide a basic level of protection. The proposals in the NPRM were consistent with this view. They would assure that
older pipelines provide at least the same basic level of protection against the growth of defects as newer pipelines
must provide. Also, limiting the proposed rules to pipelines that involve some added element of risk would leave many
miles of older pipelines without adequate protection against failures caused by the growth of defects. RSPA strongly
believes these potential failures and preventable damages should not go unchecked.

Pump Stations and Tank Farms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
API and two operators argued that the proposed rules should not apply to pump stations, tank farms, or tank farm delivery
facilities. They said compliance would be an extremely time-consuming task because of the many fittings, valves,
tanks, and instrumentation. API also suggested the benefits would be questionable since most accidents, as described
in the NPRM, occur on pipeline rights-of-way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 195 has limited application at tank farms. In general, it applies to only receiving and reinjection lines, to
tanks used as breakout tanks, and to facilities associated with breakout tanks.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the job of testing pump station and breakout tank facilities may be time-consuming, it is crucial to ensure
public safety and protect the environment. Population has encroached on the older pump stations and tank farms since
their construction, increasing their threat to public safety. Also, slow leaks at tank farms have polluted ground
water and endangered neighborhoods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering the issue of pump stations and tank farms, RSPA examined the existing rule in &sect;195.302 regarding
the testing of older onshore HVL pipelines. Except for tank farm facilities to which the rule does not apply, &sect;195.302
does not exclude any of the facilities the commenters suggested RSPA exclude from the present rulemaking. RSPA believes
non-HVL facilities should not be treated differently. Leaks at non-HVL hazardous liquid facilities can have fire
and pollution consequences. Also, even minor accidents at breakout tanks in tank farms have the potential to become
uncontrollable emergencies because of proximity to other large volume hazardous liquid storage tanks. Therefore,
RSPA has adopted the final rule as proposed concerning pump stations and breakout tanks. The demands of testing these
facilities should be mitigated, however, by the compliance deadlines, which are discussed next. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance Deadlines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RSPA proposed a deadline of 1 year after publication of the final rule for operators to plan and schedule testing or
to reduce MOPs. RSPA also proposed a deadline of 4.5 years after publication of the final rule for testing all pipelines
with more than 50 percent pre-1970 ERW pipe, and for testing at least 50 percent of all other pipelines. Finally, RSPA
proposed that operators complete all testing within 7.5 years after publication of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One operator argued that RSPA should allow operators to use the entire test period to plan testing or to reduce MOPs.
This commenter said that planning for testing or reduction in MOP would involve complicated analyses that would take
longer than 1 year. The commenter also said any plan may need to be changed because of unforeseen operational problems
that may arise during the test period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA proposed a 1-year deadline to assure that operators start their testing program early in the test period. Early
planning is necessary to minimize unexpected delays and assure that operators complete testing within the time allowed.
Also, RSPA assumed that when operators plan to reduce MOP, the reduction could be done without lengthy preparations.
Further, RSPA strongly believes any MOP reduction should be done early in the program to lessen the continuing risk
to the public. If unforeseen testing or operational problems arise during the test period, an operator could modify
its initial testing plan and schedule as needed to resolve those problems. Of course, any modified plan or schedule
would still have to provide for completion of testing before the applicable deadline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed 1-year deadline for MOP reduction or planning and scheduling testing was the same amount of time that
&sect;195.302 allowed for similar activities on the older onshore HVL pipelines. However, the process will involve
more mileage than it did for onshore HVL pipelines. Also, RSPA expects operators will need further planning to maintain
the product-supply requirements of their customers. Therefore, RSPA has extended the proposed planning and scheduling
deadline to 1.5 years in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another operator thought the proposed test period for pre-1970 ERW pipelines was unfair to operators who have many
of these pipelines. These operators would not be able to spread costs and impacts on operations over as much time as
other operators. This commenter suggested that an equitable approach would be to require that operators give pre-1970
ERW pipelines priority in testing over the full test period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA proposed a shorter test period for the pre-1970 ERW pipelines because these pipelines have unique safety problems.
The unique problems cause pre-1970 ERW pipelines to have a greater potential for failure than other older pipelines.
Since pre-1970 ERW pipelines pose a greater risk, requiring operators to test them sooner than other older pipelines
is critical to safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
API declared that the proposed testing periods would create an undue hardship on consumers and the pipeline industry.
It suggested RSPA lengthen the period to 10 years for all older pipelines, with testing priorities based on risk. Operators
and shippers need the additional time, API said, so the nation's pipeline network can adapt to the impact of the testing
program on the market. The operators and shippers would use the time to arrange alternative transportation and to
prevent regional supply disruptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using similar reasoning, two operators also urged us to allow more time for testing. One operator thought a reasonable
period would be 7 years for pre-1970 ERW pipelines, and 10 years for the others. The other operator thought the periods
should be 5 and 10 years, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA, too, is concerned about the potential adverse impact on the nation's fuel supplies that could result from testing
thousands of miles of pipelines. Aside from the substantial planning that must be done before testing, many operators
will need time to obtain waste water disposal permits from various jurisdictions. Operators will need time to prepare
pipeline systems for testing and to arrange for personnel and equipment to conduct the tests.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
System changes and actual testing must be coordinated with product-supply operations to minimize the impact on refineries,
distributors, and users of the transported products. Also, operators need time to assure that testing is done safely,
with the least environmental risk, and in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations. However, RSPA
weighed these time demands in deciding upon the compliance deadlines proposed in the NPRM. None of the commenters
who addressed the compliance-time issue substantiated their opinions that more time should be allowed. Although
it is admittedly difficult to predict how much time is appropriate, the comments do not convince us that there are too
many pre-1970 ERW pipelines to test in 4.5 years or that a decade is needed to complete testing of all other pipelines.
Therefore, the final rule adopts the testing deadlines as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA has not adopted API's suggestion to allow 10 years for all older pipelines, with priorities based on risk, because
the unique problems of pre-1970 ERW pipelines demand correction sooner. Also, considering the mileage involved,
the potential savings from reusing test water, and the need to minimize market impacts, API's suggestion would further
complicate the development of test schedules. Still, the final rule does provide operators flexibility in planning
and scheduling tests. When feasible, operators could use this flexibility to select pipelines for testing according
to leak history or other risk factors. RSPA encourages such testing priorities provided all required testing is completed
within the periods allowed.

Charts or Logs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two operators commenting on proposed &sect;195.406(a)(5) asked us not to limit allowable documentation of prior
tests or operating pressures to recording charts or logs. They said the industry has never had to keep these charts
and logs for older pipelines, and many have been lost. They suggested that the final rule allow alternative documentation,
such as construction specifications, pipeline completion reports, and affidavits from responsible people.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering the importance of a minimum 25 percent proven margin of safety to the integrity of pipelines, public safety
cannot tolerate doubts about whether a pipeline has been adequately tested. Only recording charts or logs made at
the time of prior testing or operations show with certainty that the minimum margin exists for the pipeline concerned.
Alternative documentation, including specifications, reports, or affidavits, is less probative. Such evidence
leaves some room for doubt because it does not result directly from pipeline testing or operation. Although recording
charts and logs may no longer be available for some older pipelines, RSPA does not believe a lack of proper records justifies
allowing a lesser level of proof for a matter so serious as pipeline integrity. Therefore, the final rule allows only
recording charts or logs to document a prior test or operating pressure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another operator was concerned that the documentation available for use under the proposed revision of &sect;195.406(a)(5)
may not meet existing &sect;195.310. For example, the operator said calibration data may not be available. Section
195.310 specifies the records operators must keep for each pressure test required by subpart E of part 195. Section
195.310 does not affect the documentation required by existing &sect;195.406(a)(5), and would not affect documentation
under the proposed revision of &sect;195.406(a)(5). Thus, operators need not have documentation under final &sect;195.406(a)(5)
in the same detail as &sect;195.310 requires.

Permits for Disposal of Test Water
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When existing petroleum pipelines are pressure tested hydrostatically, the testing process introduces hydrocarbons
into the test water. If test water picks up unacceptable quantities of hydrocarbons, the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) governs its discharge into the environment. (See 40 CFR parts 122&hyph;124.) The NPDES
is a regulatory program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in cooperation with qualified
State agencies under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended by the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters were concerned that the procedure of obtaining NPDES permits from State agencies and EPA for treatment
and disposal of test water could significantly delay testing. This potential for delay probably would be limited
to areas where operators do not transport test water to refineries for treatment and discharge, or do not store it for
use in subsequent tests. Although none of the commenters estimated the time that would be needed to secure the NPDES
permits, RSPA has considered this potential for delay in setting deadlines for compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two operators and API suggested that RSPA somehow help the industry in obtaining from EPA a general NPDES permit for
the disposal of treated test water. They also requested our assistance in obtaining a general waiver of the EPA requirement
to measure the toxicity of test water. API said these actions would provide flexibility for efficient scheduling
and implementation of testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has procedures for issuing permits and waivers under its NPDES program. EPA's decisions on applications for permits
and waivers depend on facts known to the industry. Under these circumstances, RSPA believes an operator is the appropriate
party to apply for permits or waivers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To hasten the process, RSPA will notify EPA of this final rule. RSPA will urge that agency to give prompt attention to
requests for NPDES permits involving disposal of test water used to comply with the final rule. RSPA will also ask EPA
to request its cooperating State agencies to give prompt attention to requests for permits and waivers.

Smart Pig Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several operators and API recommended that the final rule allow the use of smart pigs (internal inspection devices)
as an alternative to pressure testing for all pipelines, except the pre-1970 ERW pipelines. Two of these operators
said pigging is superior to pressure testing because it shows where potential problems lie. Two operators thought
pigging is better at finding corrosion problems, particularly deep isolated pits that may survive a pressure test.
One operator and API argued that smart pigs could alleviate potential disruptions of service and many environmental
and scheduling problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the capabilities of smart pigs, RSPA knows of no evidence that they can provide satisfactory long-term protection
against the growth of defects. Only a minimum 25 percent proven margin of safety between MOP and a previous test or operating
pressure is generally recognized as able to provide this protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various manufacturers have significantly improved the data collection and recording capabilities of smart pigs.
The ability of trained personnel to interpret recorded pig data has also improved. Yet smart pigs still cannot detect
as many pipeline defects that could grow to failure during operation as can an adequate pressure test. Longitudinal
defects, like cracks in a longitudinal weld seam, are particularly resistant to detection by smart pigs. More important,
an adequate pressure test provides a basis for safe operation, with a proven margin of safety against the growth of
defects that survive the test. Smart pigs cannot provide such a margin of safety. Thus, they are not an adequate substitute
for pressure testing in achieving the objectives of this rulemaking proceeding.

Carbon Dioxide Pipelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two operators argued that RSPA should not adopt the proposed rules for older carbon dioxide pipelines, particularly
production field distribution lines. They offered various reasons to exempt carbon dioxide pipelines:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Carbon dioxide is non-polluting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The pipelines are relatively new, having been constructed in the 1980s.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The pipelines have been pressure tested hydrostatically, but perhaps not to part 195 standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The failure data used as a basis for the proposed rules did not include carbon dioxide pipelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;After hydrostatic pressure testing, carbon dioxide pipelines must be dehydrated, an expensive process that
is not applicable to hazardous liquid pipelines.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Pneumatic testing with carbon dioxide or inert gas poses a greater risk than hydrostatic testing because of
the high pressures at which supercritical carbon dioxide pipelines operate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The alternative of MOP reduction would dramatically reduce enhanced oil recovery rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for carbon dioxide distribution lines, the two operators said these pipelines generally are smaller than transmission
lines, and only affect isolated areas in oil production fields. The commenters said pressure testing of carbon dioxide
distribution systems would seriously disrupt oil field operations. One of these operators said that over 50 separate
tests may be needed to minimize disruption, depending on the layout of the distribution system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of these comments, RSPA has reviewed both the need to apply the proposed rules to carbon dioxide pipelines and
the burden of compliance. Carbon dioxide pipelines have not been subject to part 195 long enough for us to develop an
accident history for them. Still, because of their similarity to hazardous liquid pipelines, untested or inadequately
tested carbon dioxide pipelines can fail in service from the growth of physical defects, whatever the pipeline's
age. Although carbon dioxide is non-polluting and nonflammable, any failure that releases large quantities of carbon
dioxide would expose nearby persons to the risk of suffocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This risk is less, however, for production field distribution lines that transport carbon dioxide than for transmission
lines that transport carbon dioxide. Compared to transmission lines, which move large volumes of carbon dioxide
over long distances, individual pipelines in a production field distribution system carry smaller volumes over
localized areas. Normally these areas are rural. In addition, the burden of compliance would be greater for field
distribution systems than for transmission lines. Testing field distribution systems could disrupt oil production
and require a multiplicity of tests to minimize that disruption. RSPA believes this combination of decreased risk
and increased burden of compliance justifies excluding from the final rule production field distribution lines
that are in a rural area. As defined in &sect;195.2, the term ``rural area'' means ``outside the limits of any incorporated
or unincorporated city, town, village, or any other designated residential or commercial area such as a subdivision,
a business or shopping center, or community development.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rules, &sect;195.302(b)(2)(ii) reflects our decision to exclude older carbon dioxide field distribution
lines in rural areas from the 25-percent-safety-margin requirement. Consistent with the present pressure testing
requirement, any portion of these older lines that is replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed on or after July 12,
1991, or any older line converted to carbon dioxide service under &sect;195.5 would have to be pressure tested to at
least 1.25 times its MOP.

Test Pressure

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, RSPA proposed to redesignate existing &sect;195.302(c), concerning the level and duration of test pressure,
as new &sect;195.303. RSPA received no comments on this proposal, and has adopted it as final. However, the term ``hydrostatic
test'' is replaced by ``pressure test'' because under existing requirements, carbon dioxide pipelines may be pressure
tested either pneumatically or hydrostatically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Test Medium
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In most cases, operators must use water as the hydrostatic test medium for hazardous liquid pipelines (&sect;195.306(a)).
However, under specified conditions, onshore pipelines may be tested with petroleum that does not vaporize rapidly
(&sect;195.306(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exception allowing operators to use petroleum as the test medium was established when only newly constructed
pipelines were subject to hydrostatic testing under part 195. Newly constructed pipelines are less likely to rupture
during a hydrostatic test than pipelines that have been in operation for a number of years and never tested or inadequately
tested. Therefore, RSPA is concerned that if existing pipelines subject to testing under the final rule were tested
with petroleum, operators would not be able to contain all the petroleum that would spill from ruptures. To preclude
this outcome, RSPA has revised &sect;195.306(b) to prohibit the use of petroleum as a test medium in pressure testing
pipelines to meet the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although RSPA's NPRM did not propose to limit the use of petroleum, the NPRM asked operators to estimate the pipeline
mileage they would test with petroleum to learn the extent to which operators might use petroleum instead of water
as the test medium. Only four operators responded, and the answers ranged from none to practically none. Based on this
information and RSPA's experience in administering the hydrostatic testing rules of part 195, disallowing the use
of petroleum as a test medium under the final rule should not significantly affect the burden of compliance with the
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although RSPA believes this action is within the scope of the NPRM, because we did not specifically propose it, &sect;195.306(b)
will be effective August 8, 1994, unless by July 7, 1994, RSPA receives comments that illustrate that this final rule
is not in the public interest. Upon receipt of such comments, RSPA will withdraw &sect;195.306(b) before the effective
date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw this section of the final
rule. The other will announce a proposal to disallow the use of petroleum as a test medium for pressure testing required
by this rulemaking and establish a new comment period. If RSPA does not receive comments that illustrate that &sect;195.306(b)
is not in the public interest, RSPA will publish a notice advising that &sect;195.306(b) will be effective on August
8, 1994.

RSPA presented a draft of the NPRM to the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (THLPSSC)
for its consideration at a meeting in Washington, DC on September 14, 1988. THLPSSC is RSPA's statutory advisory committee
for hazardous liquid pipeline safety. It is comprised of 15 members, representing industry, government, and the
public, who are technically qualified to evaluate liquid pipeline safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
THLPSSC's discussion of the draft centered on cost of compliance; problems of compliance, such as waste water disposal;
and the smart-pig alternative. THLPSSC voted not to support the draft NPRM primarily because RSPA had not yet demonstrated
that the proposed rules were cost beneficial.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At a meeting on September 14, 1989, RSPA updated THLPSSC on the status of the draft NPRM. Committee members discussed
many issues, including product supply to customers, disposal of test water, and the time needed for compliance. Although
no vote was taken, THLPSSC members representing industry indicated agreement with the need to test the older untested
or inadequately tested pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA has decided to adopt final rules in this proceeding despite THLPSSC's negative vote in 1988. RSPA did so because
THLPSSC's primary concern was that the rules be cost beneficial, and the final regulatory evaluation supports that
conclusion. Also, RSPA has addressed THLPSSC's other concerns elsewhere in this preamble in response to similar
concerns raised by commenters. The THLPSSC's reports of the 1988 and 1989 meetings are available in the docket of this

The final rules are worded differently from the proposed rules. However, other than the substantive changes discussed
above, the changes in wording are for editorial or clarification purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several existing rules, the word ``hydrostatic'' or ``hydrostatically'' is replaced by ``pressure,'' because
under subpart E carbon dioxide pipelines may be pressure tested either hydrostatically or pneumatically. Also,
the title of subpart E is changed from ``Hydrostatic Testing'' to ``Pressure Testing.'' In &sect;&sect;195.304(b)
(1) and (2), the word ``hydrostatically'' is not changed to ``pressure,'' because these rules concern factory testing
of components, not post-construction pipeline testing.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision (collectively the agencies) are amending their regulations
regarding appraisals of real estate. This final rule is adopted pursuant to Title XI of the Financial Institutions
Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule increases to $250,000 the threshold at or below which appraisals are not required pursuant to Title
XI, expands and clarifies existing exemptions to the Title XI appraisal requirement, identifies additional circumstances
when appraisals are not required under Title XI, and specifies when exempt transactions nevertheless require appropriate
evaluations. In addition, the final rule amends existing requirements governing appraisal content and the use of
appraisals prepared by other financial services institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies are adopting this final rule to further federal financial and public policy interests by reducing regulatory
burden, while requiring Title XI appraisals when necessary to protect the safety and soundness of financial institutions
or otherwise advance public policy.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), 12 U.S.C. 3331 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
directs each Federal banking agency to publish appraisal regulations for federally related transactions within
its jurisdiction. The purpose of the legislation is to protect federal financial and public policy interests in real
estate related transactions by requiring that real estate appraisals utilized in connection with federally related
transactions are performed in writing, in accordance with uniform standards, and by individuals whose competency
has been demonstrated and whose professional conduct will be subject to effective supervision. See 12 U.S.C. 3331.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1121(4) of FIRREA, 12 U.S.C. 3350(4), defines a federally related transaction as a real estate-related financial
transaction that is regulated or engaged in by a federal financial institutions regulatory agency and requires the
services of an appraiser. A real estate-related financial transaction is defined as any transaction that involves:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The sale, lease, purchase, investment in or exchange of real property, including interests in property, or the
financing thereof;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The refinancing of real property or interests in real property; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The use of real property or interests in real property as security for a loan or investment, including mortgage-backed
securities. See 12 U.S.C. 3350(5) (FIRREA section 1121(5)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their appraisal regulations, the agencies identify categories of real estate-related financial transactions
that do not require the services of an appraiser in order to protect federal financial and public policy interests
or to satisfy principles of safe and sound banking. These real estate-related financial transactions are not federally
related transactions under the statutory and regulatory definitions. Accordingly, they are subject to neither
Title XI of FIRREA nor those provisions of the agencies' regulations governing appraisals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In December 1992, Congress confirmed that the agencies may set a threshold level below which the services of state
certified or licensed appraisers are not required in connection with federally related transactions if the agencies
determine in writing that the threshold does not represent a threat to the safety and soundness of financial institutions.
See Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;550, section 954 (amending 12 U.S.C. 3341).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies jointly published a proposed rule to amend their appraisal regulations on June 4, 1993. See 58 FR 31878.
The agencies published a notice of the availability of supplemental information concerning the proposed rule and
invited further comments on November 10, 1993. See 58 FR 59688. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies are issuing this joint final rule under their authority to issue rules to implement Title XI of FIRREA
and each agency's authority to prescribe rules and regulations to carry out its responsibility to ensure that the
institutions under its supervision conduct their activities in accordance with safe and sound banking principles.
This final rule is intended to protect federal financial and public policy interests and the safety and soundness
of financial institutions, while reducing duplication, costs and regulatory burden.

B. General Comments on the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Regulated institutions generally endorsed the proposed changes to the appraisal regulations, though a small number
of savings associations, banks, and other commenters opposed changing the regulation. Appraisers almost unanimously
opposed changing the threshold, and a large number of appraisers opposed the business loan exemption. However, appraisers
commented favorably on other parts of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A large number of appraisers commented that the proposed changes would lead to abuses that caused savings associations
to fail in the mid-to-late 1980s and that the changes would violate the intent of Congress. In the experience of the
agencies, and in the opinion of studies conducted on the failures of the 1980s, abuses were related to real estate acquisition
or development projects and larger loans. The regulations issued today continue to require appraisals for these
transactions. Moreover, the regulations fully comply with the intent of Congress by continuing to protect federal
financial and public policy interests in real estate-related financial transactions as well as the safety and soundness
of financial institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulated institutions and appraisers have over three years experience with the appraisal regulations and have
urged changes in the regulations to improve credit availability and reduce duplication, costs, and regulatory burden.
Some commenters, focusing on the proposed threshold, opposed changing the regulations because they believed that
additional time was needed to study the effect of the existing regulations. Delaying the issuance of the final rule
would deny regulated institutions, appraisers, and borrowers the benefits of these changes. To the extent that subsequent
events demonstrate that additional changes are needed, the agencies can further amend the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One appraisal organization suggested that several of the proposed exemptions should be replaced with guidelines
regarding when to obtain Title XI appraisals. Because regulated institutions and appraisers can become liable for
substantial penalties for violating the regulation, the agencies believe that it benefits regulated institutions,
appraisers, and the public for the agencies to identify categories of exempt transactions in the regulation. However,
the agencies intend to provide supplemental information about the appraisal and evaluation practices of regulated
institutions in guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that they were denied an opportunity to comment on the supplemental information identified
in the November 10th notice because the materials were available only in Washington, DC, and the comment period was
30 days. The agencies believe that the public procedures on the proposed amendments to the appraisal regulations
fully complied with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and accorded the public a full opportunity
to participate in the rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The November 10th notice explained that the supplemental materials were available from each of the agencies. In accordance
with established procedures, all agencies mailed copies of those materials to any person requesting them, as well
as having the documents available for review at each agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies also believe the 30-day comment period was appropriate for the second comment period on the proposed
amendments. The notice of supplemental information requested comment on materials that dealt almost exclusively
with the appraisal threshold. As shown in Table B above, more than 11,000 comment letters were received in response
to the November 10th notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting the proposed definition of ``business loan'' as a loan or extension of credit to any corporation,
general or limited partnership, business trust, joint venture, pool, syndicate, sole proprietorship (including
an individual engaged in farming), or other business entity. The definition is used in connection with the exemption
for business loans of $1 million or less that are not dependent on the sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate
as the primary source of repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters suggested that the agencies amend the definition of business loan to include loans to individuals for
business purposes and to permit use of the exemption when individuals lease real estate to a related business. Loans
to individuals are included in the definition of business loan as loans to sole proprietorships and other business
entities. This exemption does not apply to loans to individuals that are consumer or personal loans. Therefore, the
agencies do not believe that it is necessary to amend the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(h) Real Estate or Real Property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is adding a definition of ``real estate'' and ``real property'' to &sect;225.62 of its regulation. The Board
proposed this amendment to incorporate the definition of real estate and real property employed by the other agencies.
That definition specifically excludes mineral rights, timber rights, growing crops, water rights, and similar
interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title XI of FIRREA does not define ``real estate'' or ``real property'' nor does the context in which these terms are
used suggest that the terms are intended to have different technical meanings. See 55 FR 27762 (July 5, 1990).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board used ``real property'' and ``real estate'' interchangeably throughout its appraisal rule to mean interests
in an identified parcel or tract of land and improvements. However, the Board did not intend these terms to include
mineral rights, timber rights, or growing crops when they are considered separately from the parcel or tract of land.
Valuation of such interests generally requires the services of a professional other than a real estate appraiser.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To clarify this distinction, the Board has amended its regulation to define ``real property'' and ``real estate''
for purposes of the appraisal regulation as an identified parcel or tract of land, including improvements, easements,
rights of way, undivided or future interests and similar rights in a tract of land, but excluding mineral rights, timber
rights, or growing crops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Few commenters expressed an opinion on this proposed change. Those few commenters who opposed the definition stated
that timber and growing crops should not be excluded from the definition of real estate in that the value of such items
is tied to the value of the land. Comments opposing this definition were generally from appraisers who perform farm
and timber appraisals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many states, minerals, timber, and growing crops that have not been severed from the land are considered interests
in real estate or real property. Consequently, if mineral rights are collateral for a loan in one of those states, a
question arises whether the institution must obtain a real estate appraisal of the parcel or tract of land to which
the mineral rights are attached but in which the institution has no interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board's final rule clarifies that regulated institutions are not required to obtain appraisals of the parcel
of land to which mineral rights, or similar severable interests in real estate are attached, if the transaction only
involves the severable interest rather than the parcel or tract of land. Where mineral rights, timber rights, or growing
crops, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the associated parcel or tract of land, are the subject of a real estate-related financial transaction, the services
of a licensed or certified appraiser would be required unless the transaction is otherwise exempt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the contribution of relevant mineral rights, timber rights, or growing crops should be included when
appraising a parcel of land which possesses any of these features. However, valuation of these interests would not
be required if they are not part of the transaction or if they are not relevant to the analyses which the appraiser needs
to perform to arrive at an estimate of value for the parcel or tract of land.

(1) Threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies proposed an increase from $100,000 to $250,000 in the threshold at or below which a Title XI appraisal
is not required, and specifically asked commenters whether a $250,000 or some other threshold would be appropriate.
In addition, the agencies requested information on loss experience of depository institutions for loans greater
than $250,000 and loans of $250,000 or less. On November 10, 1993, the agencies made available supplemental information
on the proposed rule and extended the comment period for 30 days in order to allow commenters to consider and comment
on the information. The supplemental information related primarily to the proposed increase in the threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A majority of the commenters addressed the threshold issue. Almost all of the commenters opposed to the increase were
appraisers, while almost all of the commenters in favor of the increase were depository institutions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of those opposed stated as the basis for their opposition that an increase in the threshold would cause substantial
losses for depository institutions, and thereby for the deposit insurance funds. To support this view, commenters
generally cited the thrift failures of the 1980s and asserted that an increase in the threshold would lead to the same
result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A total of 74 comment letters provided data on loss experience. The institutions providing the data varied in size,
and included large regional multi-bank holding companies, as well as small banks. This data is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons set forth below, the agencies have decided to raise the threshold from $100,000 to $250,000. Such an
increase will benefit consumers and lenders and will not threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions,
particularly as an evaluation will be required for all loans exempt under the threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Benefits for Consumers and Lenders of an Increase in the Threshold. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters stated that an increase in the threshold would benefit consumers and lenders. Numerous bank and thrift
commenters pointed to the cost and time needed in order to obtain an appraisal as an impediment to lending. The appraisal
was cited by several commenters as the most important factor causing delay in small business lending, and the cost
of the appraisal was described as high, especially for commercial borrowers. Commenters reported that appraisal
fees for commercial transactions between $100,000 and $250,000 could cost 5 percent of the loan amount to the borrower.
Banks and thrifts also commented that increasing the threshold would reduce regulatory burden associated with making
loans below $250,000. Many appraisers, however, commented that appraisal costs have remained relatively steady.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many appraisers also stated that appraisals by certified or licensed appraisers are necessary to protect the consumer.
The agencies believe that this assertion mischaracterizes the role of the institution's determination of collateral
value in a typical consumer transaction. The regulated institution obtains the appraisal or evaluation as part of
its loan underwriting process in order to make certain that it is adequately secured. Any appraisal ordered by a financial
institution is not designed, and generally comes too late, to assist the consumer in negotiating a contract price.
In a purchase of real estate, the purchase offer is generally made before financing is sought and the financial institution
orders an appraisal. Therefore, the appraisal represents an after-the-fact cost. Further, even when a Title XI appraisal
is not required, nothing prevents a consumer from independently obtaining an appraisal by a licensed or certified
appraiser for the consumer's own use in the negotiating process. Moreover, the agencies' rules require an institution
to obtain an appropriate evaluation of the real property collateral for transactions below the threshold, and that
evaluation would be available to the consumer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that many of the concerns about consumer protection are addressed under statutory and regulatory
programs other than Title XI of FIRREA, which focuses on bank and thrift safety and soundness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) establishes procedures for lenders to disclose to consumers the
charges for a variety of settlement services, including appraisals and evaluations. To comply with the letter and
intent of the Board's Regulation B (implementing the Equal Credit Opportunity Act), regulated institutions must
either disclose to the borrower the right to receive a copy of the documents the lender uses to value the collateral
in an application for a loan secured by a dwelling, regardless of whether the documents constitute a Title XI appraisal
or evaluation, or, as a matter of course provide the borrower with the appraisal or evaluation. Thus, to the extent
that a borrower benefits from knowing the value the lender places on the property the borrower has contracted to purchase
or pledged as collateral, the borrower should be able to benefit from that knowledge whether it is in the form of a Title
XI appraisal or an evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, although such a disclosure is not required by RESPA, Regulation B, or Title XI, the agencies believe
that a regulated institution should advise consumers whether the institution intends to have a licensed or certified
appraiser prepare the estimate of value. This should be done early enough in the loan application process to allow
the consumer to make an informed decision that the intended method of estimating the real estate's value meets his
or her needs.

Effects on Safety and Soundness of Financial Institutions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies have concluded that a $250,000 threshold would not threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Benefits to Safety and Soundness. The agencies believe that the increase in the threshold will have affirmative benefits
for safety and soundness. A decrease in appraisal requirements should relieve regulatory burden for banks and thrifts
and thereby improve their competitiveness with non-regulated lenders. Appraisal costs represent a significant
expense for certain small loans, making such lending less attractive to a potential borrower or less profitable for
the lender. Numerous comments from lenders supported this conclusion. The problem is particularly troubling for
lenders in small towns, who must pay a premium for a licensed or certified appraiser to visit the town. A GAO survey of
bankers in connection with a study of small business lending revealed that the minimum cost to perform the necessary
appraisal on commercial real estate property used as collateral for small business loans was approximately $3,000.

Experience with the $100,000 Threshold. The Board has had a $100,000 threshold in place since August 1990, and the
other agencies have had a $100,000 threshold since March or April 1992. The experience of the agencies has demonstrated
that the $100,000 threshold has posed no risk to safety and soundness.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 no bank or thrift has failed or suffered significant losses as a result of appraisal problems with loans under $100,000
or even up to $250,000. Each of the regional representatives of the Board, the FDIC, and the OCC supported adoption
of the $250,000 threshold as consistent with safety and soundness. Representatives of the OTS suggested that the
threshold should only apply to healthier thrifts. As described below, this concern has been addressed by the agencies
in the final regulation.

The Central Region of the OTS was the only OTS respondent to identify failures attributable to inadequate appraisal
practices. The Central Region identified fewer than six failures over the previous twelve years where appraisal
issues for loans under $250,000 were a major contributing factor to a thrift's failure. The Central Region noted that
in those failures where inadequate appraisal practices were a problem, other areas of loan underwriting were usually
found to be equally deficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One OCC survey respondent reported that one institution had failed because of residential and commercial loans between
$100,000 and $500,000. The respondent noted that the problems occurred before 1987, when the OCC issued guidelines
that would have prevented the institution's real estate valuation problems.

The $250,000 threshold was also supported by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), the professional association
for state officials who supervise and regulate state-chartered commercial and savings banks. The CSBS concluded
that the increased threshold would reduce unnecessary costs and would not represent a threat to the safety and soundness
of financial institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous bank and thrift commenters also reported that their experience with the $100,000 threshold had been good.
Moreover, commenters opposed to the increased threshold did not identify institutions that had failed or suffered
significant losses because of the existence of the $100,000 threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that low loss experience with a $100,000 threshold provides justification for an increase in
the threshold to $250,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data Indicate Similarities Between the $100,000 Threshold and $250,000 Threshold. A substantial body of evidence
provides strong reasons to believe that exempting loans between $100,000 and $250,000 from the Title XI appraisal
requirement will not present materially greater risk than the prior exemption for loans under $100,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data from the commercial bank Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) for year-end 1992 show
that approximately 53 percent of the dollar volume of all real estate-secured loans of all sizes in the commercial
banking industry are loans secured by 1-to-4 family residential properties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data from the Thrift Financial Reports (TFR) for year-end 1992 show that the number is 77 percent in the thrift industry.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data on loan size are not reported for residential loans on the Call Report or TFR. However, information from the National
Association of Realtors, the Census Bureau, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) indicate that
approximately 29 percent of the dollar volume of 1-to-4 family real estate loans to purchase new homes, and 33 percent
of the dollar volume of loans to finance the purchase of existing homes, fell below the prior $100,000 threshold. Approximately
56 percent of the dollar volume for new 1-to-4 family homes and 49 percent of the dollar volume for existing homes fell
between $100,000 and $250,000. In sum, 85 percent of the dollar volume of mortgages financing new homes and 82 percent
of the volume of mortgages financing purchases of existing homes will fall below the $250,000 threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, increasing the threshold from $100,000 to $250,000 is likely to more than double the amount of lending for 1-to-4
family residential real estate loans exempt from the Title XI appraisal requirement. Inasmuch as a solid majority
of total real estate lending is composed of 1-to-4 family loans, the agencies believe that 1-to-4 family loans will
be the largest block of loans exempted by the increase in the threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in 1-to-4 family residential real estate loans exempted by the $250,000 threshold will not affect safety
and soundness, as these loans are traditionally the safest in a lending institution's portfolio. In 1992, the net
loan charge-off rate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for all commercial bank loans secured by 1-to-4 family real estate was 0.23 percent; for thrifts, the net charge-off
rate for loans secured by 1-to-4 family residential real estate was 0.22 percent. Low loss rates for 1-to-4 family
residential real estate loans predate enactment of Title XI; for example, in 1991, when the great majority of 1-to-4
family loans had been originated prior to implementation of Title XI in August 1990, the charge-off rate for 1-to-4
family loans was 0.20 percent for commercial banks and 0.11 percent for thrifts. See FDIC Quarterly Banking Profile
(4th Quarter 1991) and Thrift Financial Reports (1991).

Beginning June 30, 1993, commercial banks and thrifts are required to report annually the number and dollar amount
of non-farm non-residential real estate loans, which basically constitute business loans secured by real estate.
They are also required to report the number and dollar amount of all agricultural loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data from the June 1993 Call Reports show that 12 percent of the dollar volume of real estate-secured business loans
was below the $100,000 threshold. Also by dollar volume, only 11 percent of outstanding real estate-secured business
loans fell between $100,000 and $250,000. For thrifts, the TFRs show that 10 percent of the dollar volume of all real-estate
secured business loans was below $100,000, and 9 percent between $100,000 and $250,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These findings are consistent with data compiled in the 1989 National Survey of Small Business Finances, which surveyed
firms with fewer than 500 employees. See National Survey of Small Business Finances (1989) (cosponsored by the Federal
Reserve Board and Small Business Administration). According to that survey, of the commercial mortgages to small
businesses by depository institutions, 6 percent of the dollar volume of these loans was in loans of less than $100,000,
and 12 percent was in loans between $100,000 and $250,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in the regional examiner surveys, the $100,000 threshold has not resulted in significant losses, even though
that threshold captures 12 percent of the dollar volume of small business loans. The agencies do not believe that an
increase in the threshold that exempts another 11 percent of business loans will significantly increase such losses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Call Report data also show that 63 percent of the dollar volume of agricultural real estate loans fell below the $100,000
threshold, and that 15 percent fell between $100,000 and $250,000. For thrifts, TFR data show that 46 percent of farm
loans fell below $100,000, and 36 percent between $100,000 and $250,000. Farm loans represented approximately one-half
of one percent (.58%) of non-residential mortgages held by thrifts. Thus, in the area of farm loans, only a relatively
small amount of additional loans will be exempted by the raised threshold.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the increase in the threshold will increase the dollar volume of exempt transactions, the agencies believe
that the quality of loans and lending practices of banks and thrifts will not change for these transactions. Moreover,
an institution must obtain evaluations for these exempt transactions when it does not obtain appraisals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, there is evidence that the loss rates on loans below the $250,000 threshold will be low. For 1992, the commercial
bank loss rate for farm loans was .23 percent (approximately the same loss rate as for 1-to-4 family loans). These loss
rates on residential and farm loans are significantly lower than the loss rates for the types of real estate loans that
are much less likely to fall below the $250,000 threshold_construction loans (3.54% loss rate for commercial banks)
and multifamily loans (1.68% loss rate for commercial banks). Loss rates for non-farm non-residential real estate
loans at commercial banks were 1.55 percent, higher than residential or farm loans, but still below the loss rates
experienced for loans for construction or multifamily housing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in addition to the relatively lower risk of the portfolio of real estate related loans between $100,000 and
$250,000, the fact remains that the dollar amount of each credit is relatively small. In the experience of the agencies,
banks and thrifts generally do not fail because of real estate-related financial transactions under $250,000. It
is generally large construction and development loans that have created safety and soundness problems. For example,
much of the thrift losses of the 1980s were caused by losses in large, speculative real estate development projects,
such as construction of offices, condominiums, and apartments. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
GAO Report AFMD 89&hyph;62, Thrift Failures: Costly Failures Resulted from Regulatory Violations and Unsafe Practices.
Such projects generally involve loans in much greater amounts than $250,000. The experience of the agencies continues
to be that larger development and construction loans are most likely to cause significant losses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although many commenters suggested that raising the threshold would result in losses similar to those of the thrift
failures of the 1980s, they did not offer analysis to support those statements. The agencies do not believe that inadequate
appraisals on loans under $250,000 were a significant cause of those failures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional Protections. Significant protections exist so that loans under $250,000 will not create a safety and
soundness problem once the $250,000 threshold is in place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, each agency will, during each required full-scope, on-site examination, analyze the prudence of each institution's
credit underwriting practices, including appraisal and evaluation practices, as appropriate to the institution's
size and nature of its real estate-related activities. If an institution is doing a poor job of evaluating real estate
for transactions under $250,000, then the appropriate agency may order the institution to obtain appraisals for
certain loans or for all loans above a certain amount that are not subject to another exemption.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted below, the agencies may require an appraisal for loans between $100,000 and $250,000 (not otherwise subject
to an exemption) when an institution is in troubled condition, and that troubled condition is attributable to underwriting
problems in the institution's real estate loan portfolio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, even though a bank or thrift will not generally be required to obtain a Title XI appraisal for real estate-secured
loans under $250,000, the institution must determine the value of the real estate before making the loan. Under the
appraisal regulations, banks and thrifts must support any transaction below the threshold with an evaluation that
is consistent with the agencies' guidelines. Evaluations will be performed by persons who are capable of rendering
an appropriate estimate of value of real estate as a result of their real estate-related experience or training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As several commenters noted, a $250,000 threshold will have its greatest effect in smaller communities where property
values are lower. However, as many community bank commenters pointed out, local lenders in small communities tend
to be extremely knowledgeable of property values. Also, collateral for loans of this size do not typically represent
complex problems of analysis or valuation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, a $250,000 threshold does not prevent the use of appraisals when needed. Banks and thrifts may obtain appraisals
prepared by licensed or certified appraisers whenever the institutions believe it is prudent, and customer may independently
obtain such appraisals. If, as some commenters contend, history demonstrates that such appraisals are important
to the decision to lend and the failure to obtain such an appraisal will lead to higher loss rates, then banks and thrifts
would presumably have a strong incentive to use appraisals. As several commenters noted, institutions will obtain
appraisals when their underwriting criteria warrant one, regardless of whether regulations require it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, in many cases involving residential real estate, banks and thrifts will be required to obtain the equivalent
of a Title XI appraisal in order to make the loan eligible for sale in the secondary market. According to HUD data, in
1992, secondary mortgage market purchasers, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), purchased approximately 63 percent of all 1-to-4 family
mortgages originated in the United States. In addition to the 63 percent that were purchased by major secondary mortgage
market entities, other loans were originated so as to be eligible for sale to such entities. The agencies have concluded
that the appraisal requirements of these government sponsored agencies should protect federal financial and public
policy interests in the loans that are eligible to be purchased by them. The agencies also believe that compliance
with these appraisal requirements will protect the safety and soundness of regulated financial institutions.

Data Submitted by Commenters. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The notice of proposed rulemaking asked commenters to submit loan loss data for different categories of real estate-secured
loans above and below $250,000. Many depository institution commenters noted that they do not maintain loss data
by loan size and that this information is not reasonably accessible. Only a small number of depository institutions
submitted such data. The agencies do not believe that this response is sufficiently large to base any conclusions
about industry-wide conditions. Nonetheless, the agencies note that the information provided by commenters is
consistent with the low loss rates for real estate lending indicated by other sources. The responses that the agencies
received are summarized in the following table.

Additional Comments on the $250,000 Threshold_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB Study. Several commenters opposing an increase in the threshold pointed to an August 1992 study by the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) entitled Report to Congress: De Minimis Levels for Commercial Real Estate Appraisals.
The OMB study did not oppose an increase in the threshold level but instead stated, ``OMB does not recommend_at this
time_a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
level higher than $100,000.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'' OMB study at i.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that the major concerns identified by the OMB in urging delay have been addressed with the passage
of time. Most importantly, each of the agencies now has an additional year's experience with the $100,000 threshold.
Furthermore, OMB noted that FIRREA's appraisal requirements had not been implemented in all states, but such implementation
has now occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking Process. Several commenters stated that the agencies had failed to justify increasing the threshold
from $100,000 to $250,000 because the agencies had not produced a definitive study showing that doing so would not
increase loss rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress granted the agencies explicit authority to establish a threshold consistent with safety and soundness.
The delegation of authority was broad, and no requirement for quantitative analysis was included. Nor is it reasonably
feasible for the agencies to conduct a definitive quantitative analysis that isolates the effect of obtaining Title
XI appraisals on institutions' losses on real estate-secured loans given the many variables, including changing
market conditions and varying loan underwriting practices, that may affect institutions' ultimate loss experience.
For the same reason, the agencies did not conduct a random sampling of the experience of financial institutions, as
suggested by one commenter. This does not mean, however, that the final rule fails to rely on objective data. Moreover,
that data was analyzed in light of the agencies' experience and expertise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of this rulemaking, the agencies reviewed the data the agencies currently collect from financial institutions
and sought out data that would enable the agencies to analyze the effect of the threshold on regulated institutions.
Consistent with statutory requirements, the agencies have carefully considered the effect of raising the threshold
and determined that a $250,000 threshold level does not represent a threat to the safety and soundness of financial
institutions based on the agencies' judgment, expertise, and experience. In making this determination, the agencies
have, as described above, analyzed the available data, the comments received during the rulemaking, and relevant
work of other governmental agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appraiser Employment. Many commenters from the appraisal industry objected to the proposed increase in the threshold
on the grounds that it would decrease their business and employment in the appraisal industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that an appraisal is not required because the transaction falls below $250,000, the appraisal regulation
nonetheless requires that an evaluation of the property be conducted. The agencies' appraisal rules do not impede
licensed and certified appraisers from performing these evaluations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GAO Study. Several commenters suggested that the agencies delay action on any rulemaking pending completion of General
Accounting Office (GAO) studies of the threshold scheduled for completion in April 1994 and October 1995. Congress
delegated authority to the agencies to establish a threshold in the same legislation that directed the GAO to conduct
two studies of the appraisal threshold. Congress clearly did not require the agencies to withhold action on the threshold
pending completion of the GAO studies; nor did it make agency action contingent on the outcome of the GAO studies or
any other studies. Also, in the Interagency Policy Statement on Credit Availability issued March 10, 1993, the agencies
identified a need to reexamine their existing appraisal rules to make certain that thresholds below which formal
appraisals are not needed are reasonable. Therefore, the agencies believe that it is appropriate to proceed with
the rulemaking. The agencies are cooperating with the GAO by providing information that it may use in preparing its
studies.

Private Mortgage Insurance Industry Experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A trade association representing the private mortgage insurance industry opposed increasing the threshold level
to $250,000, citing substantial losses on loans under $100,000. However, it also noted that for loans originated
in 1984, loans above $250,000 had a relative claim rate more than 50 percent higher than the claim rate for loans originated
under $100,000. Information provided by this commenter also showed that the relative claim rates on loans below $100,000
and loans between $100,000 and $250,000 were close for most years, while the relative claim rate for loans above $250,000
exceeded the claim rates for loans below $250,000 in all years except one. The commenter did not provide actual claim
rates nor dollar amounts of claims. Nor did the commenter disclose the average loan-to-value ratios for those mortgages,
a factor that could affect the loss experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the trade association stated its belief that a significant amount of the claims experienced by its members
were related to inadequate appraisals, bank and thrift commenters stated that losses on foreclosed properties were
more directly related to deterioration in the local real estate market, damage to the property, or actions or inaction
by the borrower.

Application of $100,000 Threshold to Certain Troubled Institutions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described in more detail below, the agencies are adopting substantially as proposed a separate amendment stating
that each agency continues to reserve the right to require a regulated institution to obtain a Title XI appraisal whenever
the agency believes that an appraisal is necessary to address safety and soundness concerns. This authority may involve
the agency requiring an institution to obtain an appraisal for a particular extension of credit or an entire group
of credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether an institution will be required, pursuant to this provision or existing safety and soundness authority,
to obtain an individual appraisal or group of appraisals may depend on the condition of that institution. If an institution's
troubled condition is attributable to real estate loan underwriting problems, then the appropriate agency may require
appraisals for all new real estate-related transactions of more than $100,000 that are not subject to an exemption.

A ``problem'' association is defined as an association that: (1) Has a composite MACRO rating of 4 or 5; (2) is undercapitalized
under prompt corrective action standards; (3) is subject to a capital directive or a cease and desist order, a consent
order, or a formal written agreement, relating to the safety and soundness or financial viability of the savings association,
unless otherwise informed in writing by the OTS; or (4) has been notified in writing by the OTS that is has been designated
a problem association or an association in troubled condition. (See Regulatory Bulletin 27a, Executive Compensation.)

then the agencies will reassess that threshold.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The ``Abundance of Caution'' Exemption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are amending their regulations to clarify and expand the scope of the exemption for real estate liens
taken in an ``abundance of caution.'' Under the amended rule, regulated institutions will be able to apply the abundance
of caution exemption to a broader range of transactions in which real estate is taken as additional collateral for
an extension of credit that is well supported by income or other collateral of the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to adoption of this amendment, the abundance of caution exemption was available only for transactions in which
a lien on real estate had been taken as collateral solely through an abundance of caution and where the terms of the transaction
as a consequence had not been made more favorable than they would have been in the absence of a lien. In the agencies'
experience, however, this standard was being interpreted too narrowly. As a result, regulated institutions obtained
appraisals even though they were unnecessary to protect federal financial and public policy interests in the transaction
or bank and thrift safety and soundness. Further, a transaction would not qualify for the exemption if the regulated
institution made the terms more favorable to the borrower because of the real estate collateral. Therefore, bankers
believed they were unable to use this exemption when common business practices would call for a lower interest rate
on a secured loan than an unsecured loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To qualify for the amended exemption, the regulated institution's decision to enter into the transaction must be
well supported by the borrower's income or collateral other than real estate. The following examples from the proposed
rule help to explain how this standard is applied. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A business with an established cash flow seeks a loan from a regulated institution to purchase an adjacent property
for expansion. As a common business practice, the institution takes a lien against real estate whenever available
for greater comfort. However, the institution's analysis determines that the current income from the business and
personal property available as collateral support the decision to extend credit without knowing the real estate's
market value. During loan negotiations, the institution offers to make the loan on slightly better terms for the borrower
if it receives a lien on real estate. The borrower accepts the offer and provides the real estate as additional collateral.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulated institution may reasonably conclude that the lien on the real estate was taken in an abundance of caution
because the current income from the business and personal property taken as collateral support the decision to extend
credit. Therefore, no appraisal would be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The owner of a shop seeks a term loan from a regulated institution for modernization of its facilities. The institution
determines that other sources of repayment and collateral do not sufficiently support the decision to extend credit
without taking a lien on the real estate and knowing the real estate's market value. Therefore, in order to extend credit
to the borrower prudently, the institution needs an appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulated institution should conclude that the real estate lien has 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
been taken in an abundance of caution because the other sources of repayment and collateral do not support the decision
to extend credit without knowing the real estate's market value. This transaction would not qualify for the abundance
of caution exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulated institutions generally supported the proposed amendment. Some commenters representing appraisers
agreed that the abundance of caution exemption had been too narrowly interpreted and supported the proposal to extend
the scope of the exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other appraisers commented that the agencies should require an appraisal, limited scope appraisal, or evaluation
any time a regulated institution takes real estate as collateral. Some regulated institutions noted that the prior
rule caused them to forgo liens on real estate collateral in order to avoid the expense of an appraisal, thus potentially
increasing their exposure unnecessarily. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies are not requiring appraisals for these transactions because an estimate of the real estate collateral's
value generally would not assist the regulated institution to make its lending decision. Therefore, an appraisal
generally would not further the purposes of Title XI of FIRREA nor significantly improve the safety and soundness
of financial institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Loans Not Secured by Real Estate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a uniform exemption for transactions that are not secured by real estate. The exemption
makes clear that a regulated institution is not required to obtain a Title XI real estate appraisal in connection with
a loan used to acquire or invest in real estate if the institution does not take a security interest in real estate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prior appraisal regulations of the OCC, FDIC and OTS exempted these transactions, and the amendment does not result
in any substantive change in regulatory requirements for these agencies. The amendment eliminates minor differences
between the text of the rules adopted by the OCC and OTS and the text of the FDIC's rule. Prior to adoption of the amendment,
the Board's appraisal regulation did not specifically exempt these transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a few appraisers stated that Title XI appraisals should be obtained for these transactions, other commenters,
including appraisers, supported this exemption. Several commenters stated that Title XI was never intended to reach
transactions that were not secured by real estate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In transactions covered by this exemption, the value of the real estate has no direct effect on the regulated institution's
decision to extend credit because the institution has no security interest in the real estate. The agencies conclude
that federal financial and public policy interests would not be served by requiring lenders and borrowers to incur
the cost of obtaining Title XI appraisals in connection with these transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Liens for Purposes Other Than the Real Estate's Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a new exemption for transactions in which a regulated institution takes a lien on real estate
for a purpose other than the value of the real estate. This amendment will permit regulated institutions to take liens
against real estate to protect rights to, or control over, collateral other than the real estate without obtaining
an appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulated institutions frequently take real estate liens to protect legal rights to other collateral and not because
of the value of the real estate as an individual asset. For example, in lending associated with logging operations,
a regulated institution typically takes a lien against the real estate upon which the timber stands to ensure its access
to the timber in the event of default. Similarly, where the collateral for a loan is a business or manufacturing facility,
a regulated institution may take a lien against the land and improvements in order to be able to sell the entire business
or facility as a going concern if the borrower defaults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Title XI appraisal contains an opinion of the market value of real estate. When the market value of the real estate
as an individual asset is not needed to support the regulated institution's decision to lend, no purpose is served
by requiring the institution to obtain a Title XI appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters generally favored adopting an exemption addressing these circumstances, agreeing that Title XI appraisals
did not enhance the safety and soundness of these transactions because the lenders were basing their decision to extend
credit on the value of collateral other than real estate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters suggested that this exemption could be combined with the abundance of caution exemption. Although
there are situations in which the two exemptions overlap, the agencies believe that both exemptions are necessary
because there will be transactions that qualify for one exemption, but not the other.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Real Estate-Secured Business Loans of $1 Million or Less
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a new exemption for business loans with a value of $1 million or less where the sale of, or rental
income derived from, real estate is not the primary source of repayment. The agencies also are adopting the proposed
definition of ``business loan'' as a loan or extension of credit to any corporation, general or limited partnership,
business trust, joint venture, pool, syndicate, sole proprietorship (including an individual engaged in farming),
or other business entity. This provision allows a regulated institution to take real estate as security in connection
with a loan to a small- or medium-sized business when the primary source of repayment for the loan does not depend on
sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule differs in two respects from the proposed rule. First, the exemption is available for business loans
of $1 million or less. The proposed rule would have exempted business loans less than $1 million. The change was adopted
to reduce confusion by making this provision consistent with the way other limits are treated in the rule. The change
affects the scope of the exemption very slightly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, under the final rule, the exemption is available for business loans that do not depend on real estate sales
and rental income as the primary source of repayment for the loan. The proposed rule would have exempted business loans
that were not dependent on sale of, or rental income derived from, the real estate taken as collateral as the primary
source of repayment. The change narrows the scope of the exemption by preventing a borrower from qualifying for the
exemption by showing that the primary source of repayment for the loan is income from real estate sales and rentals
involving real estate other than the real estate in which the lender has a security interest. This means, for example,
that a real estate developer cannot qualify for the exemption by showing that a real estate-secured loan for one project,
in which the lender has taken a security interest, will be repaid with income from real estate sales or rentals from
other real estate projects, in which the lender does not have a security interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following examples illustrate the application of this exemption.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The owner of a shop seeks a term loan for $1 million or less from a regulated institution. The loan will be repaid with
income derived from operations. The regulated institution would not extend credit to the borrower without a lien
against the real estate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because the loan is for $1 million or less and the sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate is not
the primary source of repayment, a Title XI appraisal would not be required for this transaction under this exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A company acquires an adjacent parcel of land to construct an office building. The company seeks a loan of $1 million
or less from a regulated institution to provide construction financing and a permanent mortgage for the office building.
The company intends to lease part of the building and will use the rental income to help repay the loan. The lender estimates
that operations of the business would contribute approximately 45 percent of the funds necessary to repay the loan
and rental income approximately 55 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulated institution should conclude that rental income derived from real estate serves as the primary source
of repayment for the loan. Therefore, assuming no other exemption is applicable to the transaction, a Title XI appraisal
would be required.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Increased Lending to Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the experience of the agencies, the appraisal requirement may have adversely affected the ability of small- and
medium-sized businesses to obtain credit. In particular, there are indications that the cost of an appraisal may
impede small- and medium-sized businesses from receiving working capital, operating loans, and other business-related
credits that otherwise would be consistent with prudent banking practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of financial institutions and financial institution trade associations that responded to the agencies'
request for comment on the effect of the business loan exemption on credit availability stated that the proposed exemption
would increase credit availability by reducing the cost and time to make real estate-secured business loans. These
commenters generally stated that the changes would have the most significant effect on credit availability for small-
and medium-sized businesses. Some appraisers also stated that the proposed changes would increase credit availability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A large number of commenters responding to the specific request for comment thought that the changes would have no
effect on credit availability. These commenters included appraisers and appraiser trade associations, a small
number of financial institutions, and other commenters. Some of these commenters stated that the ability of financial
institutions to earn a reasonable return by making relatively risk-free investments in U.S. government securities
was the cause of credit availability problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that the final rule may reduce the cost of real estate-secured loans to small- and medium-sized
businesses and increase the availability of loans to these borrowers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect on Safety and Soundness.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some commenters stated that this exemption would eliminate the requirement to obtain Title XI appraisals for a large
portion of the real estate-secured business loans in their communities. Others stated that this exemption raised
safety and soundness concerns because the only tangible collateral for many businesses is real estate. Though real
estate may be an important asset of many small- and medium-sized businesses, the agencies have concluded that this
exemption for certain business loans that do not rely on real estate as the primary source of repayment will not threaten
the safety and soundness of regulated institutions nor pose a threat to federal financial and public policy interests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the agencies are not requiring Title XI appraisals in connection with these business loans, the agencies
are requiring regulated institutions to obtain appropriate evaluations of the real estate collateral. The evaluation
should provide the institution with sufficient information on the value of the real estate to satisfy principles
of safe and sound banking. In addition, during each required full-scope, on-site examination, each agency will analyze
the prudence of each institution's credit underwriting practices, including appraisal and evaluation practices,
as appropriate to the institution's size and nature of its real estate-related activities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Shortly after the agencies issued the proposed rule, the GAO completed its report entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory Impediments to Small Business Lending Should Be Removed
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (September 1993). In the report's summary, the GAO stated: ``Specifically, we believe that real estate appraisal
requirements can be safely modified when applied to collateral taken as supplementary support for traditional small
business loans. Therefore, we agree with those aspects of the rule changes recently proposed by the banking regulators
to expand the exemptions from mandatory appraisals as they pertain to such loans.'' The GAO noted that the report and
its comment on the proposed appraisal regulations were limited ``to situations in which real estate collateral is
used to support loans to small businesses for such purposes as working capital and equipment purchases.'' This exemption
is intended to reach these loans, as well as loans for other business purposes where sale of, or rental income derived
from, real estate is not the primary source of repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conclusion that exempting these transactions will not threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions
is supported by responses to a 1993 OCC survey of its senior examining staff. The survey asked for information on the
effect of the proposed business loan exemption on bank safety and soundness, as well as information on the significance,
by loan size, of losses on loans secured by 1-to-4 family residential real estate and other categories of real estate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighteen of the 20 respondents to the OCC survey stated that the proposed exemption for business loans would not threaten
the safety and soundness of financial institutions, although some respondents noted that the exemption could present
more serious risks for small financial institutions. Respondents to the survey identified loans above $1 million
secured by non-residential real estate as the category of transactions that had the most significant losses attributable
to inadequate appraisals, followed by loans secured by non-residential real estate in the ranges $750,000 to $1 million
and $500,000 to $750,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, respondents noted that where real estate serves as only a secondary source of repayment for a business
loan, an evaluation of the collateral would be sufficient to address safety and soundness issues. Although the other
bank regulatory agencies' surveys did not include the specific questions posed in the OCC survey, the results of the
other bank regulatory agencies' surveys also generally support the business loan exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the survey responses, the data from the 1992 commercial bank Call Reports and savings associations'
TFR indicate that the exposure to the banking system from these transactions is limited. All commercial loans secured
by non-farm non-residential real estate in the range between $250,000 and $1 million (this includes both non-exempt
and exempt transactions) represent less than 4 percent of all loans for commercial banks and less than 3 percent of
all loans for savings associations. Furthermore, these loans represent less than 27 percent of commercial loans
secured by non-farm non-residential real estate at commercial banks and less than 36 percent of commercial loans
secured by such real estate at savings associations. This generally agrees with the National Survey of Small Business
Finances (1989), cosponsored by the Federal Reserve Board and Small Business Administration. The results of the
survey (adjusted to 1992 dollars) show that 22 percent of all commercial mortgages were for amounts between $250,000
and $1 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies requested specific comment on loss experience for real estate-secured business loans. Only a small
number of banks and no thrifts submitted the requested data. Although the agencies do not believe the response is large
enough to reach conclusions about industry-wide loss experience, the data submitted is consistent with the conclusion
that regulated institutions are not suffering high levels of losses in connection with real estate-secured business
loans of $1 million or less that do not depend on real estate sales or rental income as the primary source of repayment.
The responses that the agencies received are summarized in the following table.

The exemption applies only to transactions involving business loans with a value of $1 million or less. Capping the
exemption at $1 million serves two purposes. It helps to ensure that the transactions involve small- and medium-sized
businesses. It also limits the overall exposure of the banking system to transactions exempt under this provision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulated institutions typically are subject to capital-based lending limits that restrict the amount of credit
they can extend to any one borrower. While a $1 million business loan may be much more significant to a smaller institution,
the agencies believe that a second capital-based limit in the appraisal regulation is inappropriate because it can
place smaller institutions at a competitive disadvantage to larger institutions. In addition, the agencies regularly
examine the lending practices of all regulated institutions and can address problems with individual institutions
if they arise. The agencies believe it is appropriate, however, to place a limit on the size of loan that can qualify
for this exemption. Many commenters agreed that a $1 million dollar limit was appropriate.

 Some commenters suggested that the exemption should be available only if the borrower could repay the loan entirely
from sources other than sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate. Commenters also suggested specific percentage
limits on the contribution of real estate to repayment of the loan ranging from 10 to 50 percent. Other commenters stated
that the exemption should allow a regulated institution to determine whether a business loan requires an appraisal,
regardless of the contribution of real estate sales or rental income to the borrower's repayment of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption is intended to improve the ability of small- and medium-sized businesses to obtain real estate-secured
loans for business purposes. As the contribution of real estate sales and rentals to the borrower's sources for repaying
the loan increases, repayment becomes more dependent on the performance of the real estate market. Therefore, in
deciding whether a transaction qualifies for this exemption, regulated institutions should be guided by the importance
of the real estate-related sources of income to the borrower's repayment of the loan, rather than applying a universal
numerical cap. In no case, however, may a business loan qualify for this exemption if real estate-related sources
of income contribute more toward repayment of the loan than non-real estate sources of income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exempting these business loans will reduce the adverse effects on small- and medium-sized business lending associated
with the requirement to obtain a Title XI appraisal. Moreover, since repayment of these loans generally will not depend
primarily on the performance of the real estate markets, allowing lenders to make these business loans on the basis
of evaluations of the real estate collateral does not threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions.

Agricultural Lending. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies received comment letters from appraisers in rural areas who stated that the exemption should not apply
to agricultural production loans because use of the real estate generates the income for repayment of the loan. For
any transaction exempt under this provision, the regulated institution is responsible for documenting that the
borrower's sources of income are not primarily dependent upon the sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate.
The agencies do not view the sale of growing crops as the sale of real estate, nor as providing rental income derived
from real estate. The agencies have concluded that transactions involving agricultural operations present no greater
risk than other types of business operations, provided the primary source of repayment for the loan is not sale of,
or rental income derived from, real estate.

(6) Leases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies did not propose changes to the existing exemption for leases. Under this exemption, regulated institutions
are not required to obtain appraisals of leases that are not the economic equivalent of the purchase or sale of real
estate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though the agencies did not propose changes to this exemption, some commenters suggested that Title XI appraisals
should be required if a regulated institution takes any security interest in a real estate lease. The distinction
between operating leases and capital leases is well recognized in accounting practice. Consistent with the distinction
in accounting for operating and capital leases, the agencies have concluded that, in general, operating leases,
which are not equivalent to the purchase or sale of the leased property, should not require Title XI appraisals given
the limited real estate interest such leases represent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In transactions that involve capital leases (leases that are the economic equivalent of purchasing or selling real
estate), the given real estate interest is of sufficient magnitude to be counted as an asset of the lessee under accounting
practices. Generally, the agencies will continue to require regulated institutions to obtain appraisals in connection
with transactions that involve capital leases.

(7) Renewals, Refinancings, and Other Subsequent Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a modified version of the proposed exemption for renewals, refinancings, and other subsequent
transactions at the lending institution to simplify the conditions under which the exemption applies. Under the
final rule, regulated institutions will be permitted to renew or refinance existing extensions of credit without
first obtaining a Title XI appraisal for two general classes of transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, a subsequent transaction is exempt provided there has been no obvious and material change in market conditions
or physical aspects of the property that threatens the adequacy of the institution's real estate collateral protection
after the transaction, even with the advancement of new funds. This modification to the proposed rule is intended
to emphasize that an institution must consider the effect of changes in market conditions and physical aspects of
the property on its collateral protection when it advances funds in excess of reasonable closing costs as part of a
renewal, refinancing, or other subsequent transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, a subsequent transaction is exempt provided that no new monies are advanced other than funds necessary to
cover reasonable closing costs. The proposed rule did not explicitly address this class of transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies note that this exemption would not be applicable if a borrower refinances a mortgage with a new lender.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the adoption of this amendment, the agencies did not require a Title XI appraisal for a subsequent transaction
that resulted from a maturing extension of credit if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The borrower had performed satisfactorily according to the original terms; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) No new monies were advanced other than as previously agreed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The credit standing of the borrower had not deteriorated; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) There had been no obvious and material deterioration in market conditions or physical aspects of the property
which would threaten the institution's collateral protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the agencies' experience, the original exemption may not have provided sufficient flexibility to regulated institutions
and borrowers when a transaction was refinanced before its maturity. This is particularly true for refinancings
to reduce a loan's interest rate. Further, bankers questioned whether a Title XI appraisal would be required for a
refinancing where the borrower's payment history is sound and future repayment prospects are good, but the borrower's
collateral has declined in value as a result of a general market decline. The agencies believe that not requiring a
Title XI appraisal in such refinancings is consistent with safe and sound banking practices because the amount of
the loan (except for the addition of reasonable closing costs) and the lender's collateral remain the same, and the
lower loan payments may improve the ability of the borrower to repay the loan without adversely affecting the likelihood
that the lender will be repaid.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a subsequent transaction that includes the advancement of additional funds does not result in the level of collateral
protection being threatened, despite a change in the market conditions or physical aspects of the property, a Title
XI appraisal need not be obtained. For example, a loan originally extended with a low loan-to-value ratio could be
renewed and additional funds advanced above closing costs without a Title XI appraisal, even though market conditions
have deteriorated, if the regulated institution, after verifying the value of the collateral, concludes that the
new loan-to-value ratio will provide adequate protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, if a borrower is refinancing a loan where the real estate collateral is located in a market that has experienced
significant appreciation, the institution should ensure that the advancement of any new monies is based on substantiated
appreciation in value. An institution can advance funds against an appreciated property whose future use is consistent
with the use described in the original appraisal. If an institution makes a substantial advance that could possibly
threaten the institution's collateral protection, it should consider the need to obtain a new Title XI appraisal.
This exemption would not be available if a material change in the use of the property produces the reported appreciation,
such as when property is rezoned for a different use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While a Title XI appraisal is not required for transactions that qualify for this exemption, regulated institutions
are required to obtain an appropriate evaluation of the collateral in accordance with the agencies' guidelines.
The level of analysis and information included in the evaluation should be more detailed as the institution's exposure
in the transaction increases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters raised questions about the applicability of this exemption to loan restructurings and workouts.
In such situations, the commenters contended that requiring a Title XI appraisal may impede an institution's ability
to obtain additional real estate collateral to shore-up its position or to advance new funds to protect its existing
collateral position. The agencies acknowledge that the time and cost of obtaining a Title XI appraisal may present
barriers to institutions in their negotiations with borrowers in a loan restructuring or workout. The agencies believe
that this situation has been addressed in the regulation and the agencies' guidance, such as the November 7, 1991 Interagency
Policy Statement on the Review and Classification of Commercial Real Estate Loans. It is the agencies' policy to encourage
lenders to work constructively with their borrowers when restructuring existing loans that have credible support
for repayment.

(8) Transactions Involving Real Estate Notes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a modified version of the proposed exemption for transactions involving real estate-secured
loans, loan participations, pooled loans, interests in real property, and mortgage-backed securities. The amendment
clarifies when regulated institutions may engage in secondary mortgage market transactions involving real estate
loans and other interests in real estate without obtaining a new Title XI appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption adopted by the agencies clarifies and allows regulated institutions to purchase, sell, invest in,
exchange, or extend credit secured by, real estate-secured notes or interests in real estate without obtaining a
new Title XI appraisal if each note or real estate interest is supported by an appraisal that met the regulatory appraisal
requirements for the institution at the time the real estate-secured note was originated. The prior exemption referred
to purchases of these interests only. In addition, the agencies have changed the text of the final rule to more clearly
state the appraisal requirements that the underlying notes must meet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption serves federal public policy interests by helping to ensure that the appraisal regulation does not
unnecessarily inhibit secondary mortgage market transactions that involve these real estate-secured loans and
real estate interests. The exemption makes clear that a regulated institution need not obtain new Title XI appraisals
for loans originated before the effective date of the agencies' regulations in order to buy or sell them in the secondary
mortgage market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies have concluded that the transactions exempted by this provision do not require new Title XI appraisals
to protect federal financial and public policy interests or the safety and soundness of financial institutions.
Principles of safe and sound banking practice require regulated institutions to determine the suitability of purchasing
or investing in existing real estate-secured loans and real estate interests. Typically, these transactions will
have a history of performance or will have been originated according to secondary mortgage market standards. The
additional information from these sources, when coupled with the original documentation, permits regulated institutions
to make appropriate decisions regarding these transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that this exemption raised safety and soundness concerns because exempt transactions may
have appraisals performed before Title XI appraisal requirements went into effect. Because regulated institutions
will have other sources of information about the performance of these seasoned loans, the agencies believe that new
Title XI appraisals are not necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of these exempt transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters urged the agencies to expand the proposed exemption, or adopt new exemptions, to eliminate the Title
XI appraisal requirement for all mortgage-backed securities. In addition, commenters suggested that the agencies
exempt residential mortgage warehousing loans (loans to residential mortgage lenders who ultimately sell the mortgages
to the secondary mortgage market), transactions with credit ratings by established rating agencies, or transactions
that were not subject to the agencies' jurisdiction at origination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that to protect federal financial and public policy interests, the underlying loans or real
estate interests should have appraisals that meet the requirements that were applicable to regulated institutions
when the underlying transactions were originated. For this reason, the agencies are not adopting the suggestions
for exempting additional categories of transactions under this provision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters also suggested that the agencies should permit a regulated institution that purchases a pool of loans,
invests in mortgage-backed securities, or secures a mortgage warehousing loan with real estate notes, to confirm
that the loans have appropriate appraisals without reviewing the appraisal for each underlying loan. The agencies
agree that it should not be necessary to review the appraisal for each underlying loan in all cases. The agencies believe
that regulated institutions may use sampling and audit procedures to determine whether appraisals for the underlying
loans in a loan pool satisfy the regulation's requirements and to verify the seller's representations and warranties.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies also believe that a regulated institution may presume that the underlying loans in an investment-grade,
marketable, mortgage-backed security satisfy the requirements of the appraisal regulation whenever an issuer
makes a public statement, such as in a prospectus, that the appraisals comply with the agencies' regulations. To be
considered investment grade, a security must be rated in one of the top four rating classifications of at least one
nationally recognized statistical rating service. A marketable security is one that may be sold with reasonable
promptness at a price that corresponds to its fair value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For mortgage warehousing loans, sale to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac of the mortgages that secure the mortgage warehouse
loan may be used to demonstrate that the underlying loans complied with the appraisal requirements of the agencies'
regulations. The institution, however, must continue to monitor its borrower's performance in selling loans to
the secondary market and take appropriate steps, such as increased sampling and auditing of the loans and their documentation,
if the borrower experiences more than a minimal rejection rate.

(9) Transactions Insured or Guaranteed by a U.S. Government Agency or U.S. Government Sponsored Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a uniform exemption for transactions that are wholly or partially insured or guaranteed
by a United States government agency or government sponsored agency because these loans pose little risk to insured
institutions. This exemption will eliminate the confusion among regulated institutions who may believe that two
separate appraisals are required_one meeting the banking agencies' regulations and another meeting the federal
loan programs' standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prior regulations of the OCC, FDIC, and OTS exempted many of these transactions. However, they previously required
that these transactions be supported by an appraisal that conformed to the requirements of the insuring or guaranteeing
agency. Prior to adoption of this amendment, the Board's appraisal regulation did not specifically exempt these
transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federally insured or guaranteed transactions must meet all the underwriting requirements of the federal insurer
or guarantor, including real estate appraisal requirements, in order to receive the insurance or guarantee. The
agencies believe that the standards of these loan programs are sufficient to protect the safety and soundness of regulated
financial institutions. Therefore, it is unnecessary to require that these transactions also meet the overlapping
requirements of the banking and thrift agencies' appraisal regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters suggested that the agencies should limit the application of this exemption to federal loan programs
with appraisal requirements that conform to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and
require the use of licensed or certified appraisers. In addition, commenters raised concerns that some loan programs
may not have appraisal standards and asked the agencies to list those loan programs to which this exemption applies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB has directed federal agencies with government guaranteed or insured loan programs to conduct real estate appraisal
programs in a manner to reduce default risks to the federal government. Specifically, these federal agencies are
required to ensure that all real estate credit transactions over $100,000 have an appraisal performed by a state licensed
or certified appraiser and that the appraisal be conducted under appraisal standards that are consistent with the
USPAP.

The agencies believe that the authority of OMB to ensure that federal agencies adopt appropriate real estate appraisal
standards eliminates the need to list specific loan programs for which this exemption applies. Moreover, OMB is monitoring
the implementation of those appraisal programs and has required any federal agency not having appraisal standards
and practices in place to submit an implementation plan and schedule to OMB. If the agencies later determine that a
particular federal loan program poses a threat to the safety and soundness of regulated institutions, the agencies
have retained the authority to require appraisals in such situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption also applies to certain other real estate-related financial transactions involving government
agencies or government sponsored agencies. For example, the U.S. Postal Service typically contracts with a developer
to erect and lease a special purpose building for the Postal Service's use. Applicable contract procedures normally
require only cost estimates when determining who is awarded the contract. The Postal Service also enters into a lease
with the developer. The lease payments, which are assigned to the lender, are sufficient to repay the loan. Because
the developer is complying with applicable contract procedures, which require only cost estimates, it would be an
unnecessary burden for the developer or the lender to also obtain a Title XI appraisal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a modified version of the proposed exemption for transactions that meet the qualifications
for sale to any U.S. government agency or government sponsored agency. By referring to any U.S. government agency
or sponsored agency, the exemption includes not only loans sold to federal agencies, but also any transaction that
meets the qualifications for sale to agencies established or chartered by the federal government to serve public
purposes specified by the U.S. Congress. These government sponsored agencies are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Banks for Cooperatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption permits regulated institutions to originate, hold, buy, or sell transactions that meet the qualifications
for sale to any U.S. government agency and the above listed government sponsored agencies without obtaining a separate
appraisal conforming to the agencies' regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption contains a modification to the original proposal that permits regulated institutions to accept appraisals
performed in accordance with the appraisal standards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for any residential real estate
transaction, both single family and multifamily, regardless of whether the loan is eligible to be purchased by Fannie
Mae or Freddie Mac. This modification clarifies that a regulated institution's ``jumbo'' or other residential real
estate loans that do not conform to all the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, but that are supported
by an appraisal that meets the appraisal standards of these agencies, will qualify for this exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption expands the prior exception to the regulations of the OCC, FDIC, and OTS for transactions involving
1-to-4 family residential properties that had appraisals conforming to the appraisal standards of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac. In addition, the OTS exception applied to existing multifamily properties. These transactions were
not required to comply with the additional supervisory standards set forth in the prior regulations. The Board did
not have a similar exception in its prior regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters requested that the agencies continue the prior exception allowing the use of Fannie Mae or Freddie
Mac standards for any loans involving 1-to-4 family residential real estate. Other commenters stated that the proposed
exemption should not be adopted because the agencies would not be meeting their statutory obligation to set appraisal
standards for transactions within their jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe the appraisal standards of the U.S. government agencies or sponsored agencies established
to maintain a secondary market in various types of loans are appropriate for these exempt transactions. Recently,
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac revised their 1-to-4 family residential appraisal standards and report forms to incorporate
the USPAP as the minimum appraisal standards. Further, the appraisal standards and forms of Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac are recognized as the appraisal industry's standard for residential real estate appraisals. The agencies have
concluded that those appraisal standards should protect federal financial and public policy interests in the loans
that are eligible for purchase by U.S. government agencies or sponsored agencies. The agencies also believe that
compliance with these standards will protect the safety and soundness of regulated financial institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that permitting regulated institutions to follow these standardized appraisal requirements,
without the necessity of obtaining a separate appraisal or an appraisal supplement for conformance with the banking
agencies' regulations, will reduce regulatory burden and increase an institution's ability to buy and sell these
types of loans, improving the institution's liquidity.

(11) Transactions by Regulated Institutions as Fiduciaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a new exemption for transactions in which a regulated institution is acting in a fiduciary
capacity and is not required to obtain an appraisal under other law. The amendment clarifies that regulated institutions
acting as fiduciaries are not required to obtain appraisals under the agencies' appraisal regulations if no appraisal
is required under other law governing their fiduciary responsibilities in connection with those transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to adoption of this amendment, it was unclear whether the agencies' appraisal regulations required appraisals
for all real estate-related financial transactions in which regulated institutions participated as fiduciaries.
For example, other law may not require an appraisal in connection with the sale of a parcel of real estate to a beneficiary
of a trust on terms specified in the trust instrument. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While financial institutions were in general agreement with the proposed exemption, some of these commenters stated
that a fiduciary should be exempt from meeting Title XI appraisal requirements regardless of whether other laws require
an appraisal. Commenters opposing this exemption believe that fiduciaries should be required to obtain a Title XI
appraisal for all their real estate-related transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies have concluded that a Title XI appraisal should not be required when regulated institutions engage in
real estate-related financial transactions as fiduciaries and no other law (including state common law establishing
the responsibilities of fiduciaries) requires appraisals for those transactions. Losses as a result of these transactions
would not, absent some negligence by the institution, be incurred by the institution. Therefore, exempting these
transactions from the Title XI appraisal requirement should not adversely affect the safety and soundness of financial
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a fiduciary transaction requires an appraisal under other law, that appraisal should conform to the requirements
of the agencies' regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision was added to the rule to make clear that the agencies retain the authority to determine in a given case
when the services of an appraiser are not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only a few commenters addressed this issue. One commenter expressed the concern that the agencies are granting themselves
the authority to create new exemptions without the benefit of public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies have the authority to implement and interpret regulations under their jurisdiction. The specific exemptions
of the regulation describe the major categories of transactions that would not require appraisals. As a result of
their experience in implementing their regulations, however, the agencies recognized that it is impossible to identify
all types of transactions for which the services of an appraiser should not be required under Title XI of FIRREA and
proposed this exemption to confirm their authority to determine that individual transactions do not require the
services of an appraiser. The agencies will adopt any new exemptions covering broad categories of transactions in
accordance with notice and comment rulemaking procedures.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting a modified version of the proposed amendment concerning evaluations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule requires regulated institutions to obtain evaluations for real estate-related financial transactions
that do not require Title XI appraisals because they: (i) Are below the threshold level; (ii) qualify for the exemption
for business loans of $1 million or less where income from real estate is not the primary source of repayment; or (iii)
qualify for the exemption for subsequent transactions resulting from an existing extension of credit. The agencies
changed the text of this amendment to make clear that institutions must still obtain evaluations for these exempt
transactions. The regulation does not require the institution to have an evaluation if the transaction qualifies
for an exemption other than these three exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An evaluation provides a general estimate of the value of real estate and need not meet the detailed requirements of
a Title XI appraisal. An evaluation must provide appropriate information to enable the institution to make a prudent
decision regarding the transaction. Because institutions must tailor evaluations to provide appropriate information
for different types of transactions, the content and form of evaluations will vary for different transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their prior regulations, the OCC, Board and OTS required evaluations for all real estate-related financial transactions
that do not require appraisals. The FDIC's prior regulation stated that supervisory guidelines, general banking
practices or other prudent standards may require an appropriate valuation of real property collateral when a Title
XI appraisal is not required. For some institutions, the effect of these provisions may have been to require evaluations
in cases where they did not assist in protecting the institutions' safety and soundness. The agencies are amending
their regulations to require regulated institutions to have evaluations only for those real estate-related financial
transactions where an understanding of the real estate's value is generally needed to assist the institution in deciding
whether to enter into the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that evaluations should not be required for any exempt transactions and that the decision
to obtain an evaluation should be left to the institution. Commenters suggested that the agencies should require
appraisals for any transaction that requires an evaluation and raised questions about the qualifications and independence
of persons performing evaluations. Some commenters stated that only licensed or certified appraisers were qualified
to perform evaluations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that safety and soundness principles require institutions to obtain an understanding of, and
document, the value of the real estate involved in transactions that: (i) Are below the threshold level; (ii) qualify
for the exemption for business loans of $1 million or less where income from real estate is not the primary source of
repayment; or (iii) involve an existing extension of credit. In these cases, while a Title XI appraisal is not required
to determine the value of the real estate, the agencies have concluded that regulated institutions must have an estimate
of the real estate's value as a matter of safe and sound banking practice. For this reason, the agencies have decided
that institutions should not have the discretion to decide whether they will obtain evaluations for these transactions.
However, institutions will have discretion, within the limits of safe and sound banking practice as indicated in
agency guidance, to determine the content and form of the evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While licensed or certified appraisers may be qualified to perform evaluations, the agencies do not believe these
appraisers are the only persons that can render a competent estimate of the value of real estate for exempt transactions.
Requiring institutions to procure the services of a licensed or certified appraiser to prepare evaluations or Title
XI appraisals for exempt transactions could impose significant additional costs on lenders and borrowers without
significantly increasing the safety and soundness of the transactions. However, the agencies' regulations do not,
as suggested by some commenters, prohibit regulated institutions from using licensed or certified appraisers to
prepare evaluations. Nor do the regulations prevent regulated institutions from obtaining Title XI appraisals
for exempt transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies also believe that regulated institutions can take steps to ensure that the individuals performing evaluations
are capable of providing an unbiased estimate of value. Institutions would generally be expected to check that persons
who prepare evaluations are subject to adequate safeguards and controls to assure the integrity of the evaluation
they perform. The agencies intend that regulated institutions have some flexibility in the safeguards they erect
to ensure the independence of the person performing the evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies' experience with transactions exempt under their prior appraisal requirements indicates that employees
of a regulated institution generally can provide an unbiased and competent evaluation of real estate collateral
for exempt transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there are deficiencies in an individual institution's evaluation procedures, including its procedures for determining
whether to order Title XI appraisals for exempt transactions, the agencies can take appropriate steps to have the
institution correct the problem. This can include requiring the institution to obtain appraisals for exempt transactions
to address safety and soundness problems.

.3(c)&blank;Appraisals To Address Safety and Soundness Concerns
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting substantially as proposed an amendment stating that each agency continues to reserve the
right to require a regulated institution to obtain a Title XI appraisal whenever the agency believes that an appraisal
is necessary to address safety and soundness concerns. This authority may involve the agency requiring an institution
to obtain an appraisal for a particular extension of credit or an entire group of credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters raised the concern that the agencies' authority to require a Title XI appraisal for safety and soundness
purposes should be exercised only on a prospective basis. Further, several commenters noted that the agencies' authority
to determine on a case-by-case basis whether an appraisal is required may lead to inconsistencies among the agencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether an institution will be required, pursuant to this provision or existing safety and soundness authority,
to obtain an appraisal for a particular extension of credit, or an entire group of credits, may depend on the condition
of that institution. If an institution is in troubled condition, and that troubled condition is attributable to underwriting
problems in the institution's real estate loan portfolio, then the agencies may require such an institution to obtain
an appraisal for all new real estate-related financial transactions below the threshold that are not subject to another
exemption. Thus, for example, a troubled institution whose problems are attributable to trading losses, investment
losses, or a defalcation might be allowed to continue to operate under the $250,000 threshold, whereas an institution
whose problems are attributable to poor underwriting of real estate loans may be subjected to a lower threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, regardless of an institution's condition, an examiner may determine that a particular real estate-related
financial transaction requires a Title XI appraisal. This provision confirms that the agencies have the authority
to require appraisals for a particular transaction to address safety and soundness concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A determination that a particular institution will have to obtain appraisals below the threshold will be made by the
appropriate agency's supervisory office. Although this provision is intended to be applied on a case-by-case basis
to address the problems of a particular institution, the agencies will work to maintain consistency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously stated in the discussion of the appraisal threshold, as a matter of policy, OTS intends to require problem
institutions or institutions in troubled condition to continue to obtain Title XI appraisals for loans over $100,000.
Given the overall concentration of real estate-related transactions in the thrift industry, OTS believes that a
problem thrift or a thrift in troubled condition will, in general, have real estate-related asset quality problems.

.4(a)&blank;Minimum Appraisal Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting five minimum appraisal standards in place of the 14 standards in the prior rule. The final
rule includes four modifications to the proposed rule concerning minimum appraisal standards. The final rule requires
all appraisals for federally related transactions to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Conform to generally accepted appraisal standards as evidenced by the USPAP unless principles of safe and sound
banking require compliance with stricter standards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Be written and contain sufficient information and analysis to support the institution's decision to engage
in the transaction; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Analyze and report appropriate deductions and discounts for proposed construction or renovation, partially
leased buildings, non-market lease terms, and tract developments with unsold units; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Be based upon the definition of market value as set forth in the regulation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Be performed by State licensed or certified appraisers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adoption of these standards will simplify compliance with the appraisal regulation without affecting the usefulness
of the Title XI appraisals prepared for federally related transactions. The amendment allows institutions to make
use of the USPAP Departure Provision and eliminates several regulatory standards that parallel existing USPAP standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies proposed three alternatives for meeting the statutory requirement to use the USPAP in setting minimum
appraisal standards for federally related transactions. Under the first two alternatives, the agencies would have
published the USPAP as part of their regulations (either as an appendix to their rules or through incorporation by
reference). The agencies have chosen to adopt the third alternative that generally references USPAP, but does not
make USPAP a part of the agencies' regulations. The agencies agree with many commenters who believed that Alternative
III was the most workable approach because the agencies would not have to republish changes to the USPAP adopted by
the Appraisal Standards Board, and references to USPAP in the regulation could be assumed to always refer to the most
current USPAP edition. The agencies believe that Alternative III minimizes potential conflicts between an institution's
duty to follow the agencies' appraisal requirements and an appraiser's professional obligation to follow the latest
USPAP version. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the agencies are adopting Alternative III, USPAP provisions applicable to federally related transactions
will no longer be published as Appendix A to the agencies' appraisal regulations. Therefore, each agency has deleted
Appendix A from its appraisal regulation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because application of present or future USPAP standards to federally related transactions may be inconsistent
with maintaining the safety and soundness of financial institutions, the agencies have modified the standard on
compliance with the USPAP. This modification makes clear that principles of safe and sound banking may require institutions
to comply with stricter standards than the USPAP. Although the institution has the primary responsibility for obtaining
a Title XI appraisal that meets its needs, the agencies may by regulation or guidance identify USPAP standards that
are inappropriate for federally related transactions. For example, the USPAP allows an appraiser to appraise property
even though the appraiser may have a direct or indirect interest in the property, if the appraiser discloses this fact
in the appraisal report. The agencies believe, however, that federal financial and public policy interests are better
served by requiring that an appraiser for a federally related transaction not have any direct or indirect interest,
financial or otherwise, in the transaction or the property. The agencies have included this requirement in the section
of the regulation that deals with appraiser independence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum standards also permit regulated institutions to use appraisals prepared in accordance with the USPAP
Departure Provision for federally related transactions. The Departure Provision permits limited exceptions to
specific guidelines in the USPAP. Appraisers preparing appraisals using the Departure Provision still must comply
with all binding requirements of the USPAP and must be sure that the resulting appraisal will not be misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that regulated institutions should be allowed to determine, with the assistance of the appraiser,
whether an appraisal to be prepared in accordance with the Departure Provision is appropriate for a particular transaction
and consistent with principles of safe and sound banking practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies are adopting a modified version of the proposed standard that requires appraisals for federally related
transactions to be written. The modification makes clear that the written appraisal must contain sufficient information
and analysis to support the institution's decision to engage in the transaction. The modification puts regulated
institutions on notice of their responsibility to have appraisals that are appropriate for the particular federally
related transaction. The agencies are aware that the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation has proposed
changing the USPAP to expand the types of appraisal reports that appraisers may prepare. The agencies believe that
the standard on written appraisals permits regulated institutions to take advantage of additional flexibility
that may be available if the USPAP is amended, as long as the appraisal report contains information and analysis to
support the institution's decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies are retaining from the prior rule the standard regarding deductions and discounts. The USPAP provision
on this subject requires the appraiser to include a discussion of deductions and discounts only when it is necessary
to prevent an appraisal from being misleading. Although commenters were divided over the need to retain this regulatory
standard, the agencies have decided that it is appropriate to emphasize the need to include an appropriate discussion
of deductions and discounts applicable to the estimate of value in Title XI appraisals for federally related transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in order to properly underwrite a loan, a regulated institution may need to know a prospective value of
a property, in addition to the market value as of the date of the appraisal. A prospective value of a property is based
upon events yet to occur, such as completion of construction or renovation, reaching a stabilized occupancy level,
or some other event to be determined. Thus, more than one value may be reported in an appraisal, as long as all values
are clearly described and reflect the projected dates when future events could occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard on deductions and discounts is intended to make clear that appraisers must analyze, apply, and report
appropriate discounts and deductions when providing values based on future events. In financing the purchase of
an existing home, there typically would be no need to apply any discounts or deductions to arrive at the market value
of the property since the institution's financing of the project does not depend on events such as further development
of the property or the sale of units in a tract development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In place of the proposed standard on market value, the agencies are retaining the prior standard that required the
appraisal to be based on the definition of market value contained in the agencies' rules. Use of the standard from the
prior rule is intended to emphasize that the agencies are not changing the definition of market value or the manner
in which that definition is applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies are eliminating regulatory standards that parallel or duplicate requirements of the USPAP. The regulatory
standards originally were put in place because of uncertainty about the content of the USPAP and its interpretation.
Based on their experience with the USPAP, the agencies believe that the additional standards may be eliminated. Commenters
generally agreed. The majority of commenters responded to three specific questions on the need for additional regulatory
standards by indicating that it was unnecessary to adopt separate standards on: (i) Analysis of revenues, expenses
and vacancies; (ii) valuation of personal property; and (iii) reconciliation of the three approaches to value. The
elimination of regulatory standards that parallel USPAP standards should simplify the preparation of appraisals
for federally related transactions and reduce regulatory burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, the agencies are adding a new provision to make clear that all appraisals for federally related transactions
must be prepared by licensed or certified appraisers. This requirement is mandated by Title XI of FIRREA and repeated
in other parts of the appraisal regulation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are removing the provision that required appraisers to disclose and explain when information necessary
to the completion of an appraisal is unavailable. The USPAP currently requires appraisers to disclose and explain
the absence of information necessary to completion of an appraisal that is not misleading. See USPAP Standard Rule
2&hyph;2(k). Moreover, when information that may materially affect the estimate of value is unavailable, the agencies
believe that generally accepted appraisal standards require appraisers to explain the absence of that information
and its effect on the reliability of the appraisal. Therefore, eliminating this provision does not result in a substantive
change in the requirements applicable to appraisals for federally related transactions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are removing a provision that merely confirmed the authority of regulated institutions to require appraisers
they use to comply with additional standards. The regulation's minimum appraisal standards for federally related
transactions do not prevent a regulated institution from requiring an appraiser to follow additional standards
or provide additional information to satisfy the institution's business needs and it is unnecessary to restate this
fact in the appraisal regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies are adopting the proposed amendment concerning the use of appraisals prepared for financial services
institutions other than institutions subject to Title XI of FIRREA. The agencies' prior appraisal regulations provided
that fee appraisers must be engaged by the regulated institution or its agent. An exception to this requirement was
permitted if the appraiser was directly engaged by another institution that is subject to Title XI of FIRREA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies concluded that the prior provision on the use of appraisals prepared for other institutions was too restrictive.
It required a regulated institution to obtain a new appraisal if the borrower originally sought a loan from an institution
that was not subject to Title XI of FIRREA and was not an agent of that regulated institution. There also was uncertainty
about the meaning of agent in these cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended provision permits a regulated institution to use an appraisal that was prepared for any financial services
institution, including mortgage bankers, if certain conditions are met. The appraiser must be engaged directly
by the financial services institution and must not have a direct interest, financial or otherwise, in the property
or the transaction. In addition, the regulated institution must ensure that the appraisal conforms to the requirements
of the regulation and is otherwise acceptable. The prohibition on the institution using an appraisal prepared for
the borrower remains in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of comments concerning this provision favored the proposed change. One commenter requested that the
agencies define financial services institutions and include mortgage brokers within that definition. Other commenters
requested clarification of the circumstances under which a non-regulated institution can be an agent of a regulated
institution and whether agents are prohibited from receiving a commission on each transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies have decided not to adopt a specific definition of financial services institution. This term is intended
to describe entities that provide services in connection with real estate lending transactions on an ongoing basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies do not intend to limit the arrangements that regulated institutions have with their agents, provided
those arrangements do not place the agent in a conflict of interest that prevents the agent from representing the interests
of the regulated institution. For example, the agencies do not require that there be a written agreement between the
regulated institution and the agent, and the agent may represent the regulated institution solely with respect to
ordering appraisals. In addition, the agencies' regulations do not prohibit agents from receiving a commission
for transactions on which they order appraisals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters opposed the amendment because of their concern that it would increase the pressure on appraisers
to render an estimate of value that favors the interests of the borrower. However, regulated institutions are not
required to accept appraisals that are prepared for other financial services institutions. Therefore, the institution
always retains complete control over the process of ordering real estate appraisals. In addition, institutions
must determine that the appraisal ordered by the financial services institution complies with the requirements
of the agencies' regulations and is otherwise acceptable. This should include obtaining assurance that the financial
services institution has an independent appraisal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other suggested changes to reduce the burden on secondary market transactions involving real estate notes, particularly
for mortgage warehousing loans, are addressed in the exemption for transactions in real estate notes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The transaction is not secured by real estate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A lien on real estate has been taken for purposes other than the real estate's value; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(5) The transaction is a business loan that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Has a transaction value of $1 million or less; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is not dependent on the sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate as the primary source of repayment;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A lease of real estate is entered into, unless the lease is the economic equivalent of a purchase or sale of the leased
real estate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The transaction involves an existing extension of credit at the lending institution, provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) There has been no obvious and material change in market conditions or physical aspects of the property that threatens
the adequacy of the institution's real estate collateral protection after the transaction, even with the advancement

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) There is no advancement of new monies, other than funds necessary to cover reasonable closing costs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

loan or interest in a loan, pooled loans, or interests in real property, including mortgaged-backed securities,
and each loan or interest in a loan, pooled loan, or real property interest met FDIC regulatory requirements for appraisals
at the time of origination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The transaction is wholly or partially insured or guaranteed by a United States government agency or United States
government sponsored agency;

(i) Qualifies for sale to a United States government agency or United States government sponsored agency; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Involves a residential real estate transaction in which the appraisal conforms to the Federal National Mortgage
Association or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation appraisal standards applicable to that category of real estate;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) The regulated institution is acting in a fiduciary capacity and is not required to obtain an appraisal under other
law; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) The FDIC determines that the services of an appraiser are not necessary in order to protect Federal financial

of the institution.

(5) The transaction is a business loan that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Has a transaction value of $1 million or less; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is not dependent on the sale of, or rental income derived from, real estate as the primary source of repayment;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A lease of real estate is entered into, unless the lease is the economic equivalent of a purchase or sale of the leased
real estate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) There has been no obvious and material change in market conditions or physical aspects of the property that threatens

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) There is no advancement of new monies, other than funds necessary to cover reasonable closing costs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

at the time of origination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The transaction is wholly or partially insured or guaranteed by a United States government agency or United States
government sponsored agency;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Involves a residential real estate transaction in which the appraisal conforms to the Federal National Mortgage
Association or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation appraisal standards applicable to that category of real estate;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) The regulated institution is acting in a fiduciary capacity and is not required to obtain an appraisal under other
law; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

that is consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Single Family Property Disposition program (24 CFR part 291), which disposes of one-to-four family properties
acquired by HUD or otherwise held by HUD, includes an initiative by the Department for the lease and sale of properties
to governmental entities, tribes, and private nonprofit organizations for use by homeless persons (subpart E of
part 291). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulations, applicants that have been preapproved by HUD are notified of the availability of properties
for a 10-day consideration and inspection period before the properties are offered for sale to the general public.
(See 24 CFR 291.410(d).) Properties are leased or sold to applicants on a first come-first served basis. No more than
10 percent of the total inventory, as of October 1, may be leased under the program; there is no limitation on the sale
of properties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants may purchase properties, at a discount, either through a direct sale or by submitting a competitive bid.
Applicants that choose to lease properties may purchase them at any time during the leasehold. Leases are for a one-year
term, renewable for up to four additional one-year terms, for $1 a year. Lessees are responsible for all utilities,
taxes, and other costs associated with operating the property. Under 24 CFR 291.415(d), lessees are required to establish
an escrow account, with HUD as a co-signer, and make monthly deposits to the account in an amount sufficient to reimburse
HUD for any taxes on the property.

II. Amendments by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1407 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved Oct. 28, 1992; hereafter
referred to as ``1992 HCD Act'') directs the Secretary to make several amendments to this discretionary program.
Subsection 1407(a) prohibits the Secretary from making a property available for lease under the homeless initiative
program unless the property has first been listed and made generally available for sale to the public for at least 30
days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection 1407(b) of the 1992 HCD Act provides an exception to subsection 1407(a) with respect to any area in which
the Secretary determines that there will not be a sufficient quantity of decent, safe, and sanitary affordable housing
available for use under the program if properties located in the area are first made generally available to the public.
In such exception cases, the Secretary will make available to preapproved applicants up to 10 percent of the total
number of properties in the HUD inventory for the area before offering those properties to the general public. The
Secretary is also directed to consult with the unit of general local government for the area in determining which properties
should be reserved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1992 HCD Act, in subsection 1407(c), also directs the Secretary to identify and describe, upon request by an applicant
or lessee, any exemptions or reductions related to the payment of property taxes under State or local laws that may
be applicable to lessees or to the leased properties. Finally, subsection 1407(c) of the 1992 HCD Act also provides
that the Secretary may not require the lessee to make deposits for the payment of taxes into an escrow account, where
such an exemption or reduction is provided.

On August 11, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule (58 FR 42707) which would implement the changes required
by section 1407 of the 1992 HCD Act, as well as some additional conforming changes. This final rule implements those
proposed changes as described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
30-day Marketing Period and Exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with subsection 1407(a), this final rule amends 24 CFR 291.400(c) to reflect the statutory requirement
that HUD make property available for sale to the general public for at least 30 days before HUD makes the property available
for lease under the program. In addition, this final rule also requires that the property be vacant, and not under contract
or committed to another program for availability under the lease program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule also adds conforming changes to &sect;291.410(d) regarding notification to applicants of available
properties. After the public sale period, the HUD Field Office will notify applicants of eligible properties available
in the ZIP Code areas previously designated by them. Specific properties selected by an applicant will be held off
the market for a 10-day consideration and inspection period, which will begin to run upon written notification by
the applicant to the Field Office. (The Department encourages applicants to notify Field Offices by Facsimile (FAX).)
Only those properties in which an applicant has submitted a written expression of interest will be held off the market.
If no further communication from the applicant is received by the end of the 10-day consideration and inspection period,
the Field Office will resume offering the properties for sale to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 1407(b) of the 1992 HCD Act, the final rule provides an exception to the 30-day listing for
general sale in Field Offices having 200, or fewer, total properties in inventory as of October 1 of each year. HUD has
determined that these offices are less likely to have properties available for applicants after 30 days on the market.
HUD will select these ``exception'' field offices based upon the number of properties held in inventory as of October
1, of each year (initially October 1, 1993), the number of properties the Department anticipates acquiring over the
ensuing 12-month period and the speed with which such properties are selling. In ``exception'' Field Offices, if
homeless providers have requested to lease properties, properties will be offered to them for a 10-day consideration
and inspection period before the properties are listed for sale to the general public. Field Offices subject to this
exception will notify applicants of properties in designated ZIP Code areas prior to public listing until such time
as 10 percent of their total inventory, as of October 1, has been leased. The Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal
Housing Commissioner will supply a list of the exception Field Offices to the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning
and Development and all field offices on an annual basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also provides that, in those Field Offices subject to the exception, HUD will consult with units of general
local government to identify areas where there is a need for units for homeless persons and will make this information
available to applicants. However, local governments will not have veto-power over where properties used by the homeless
are located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Exception From or Reduction of State and Local Property Taxes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule also amends 24 CFR 291.415(d) to describe HUD's duty under subsection 1407(c) of the 1992 HCD Act to provide
information to applicants or lessees regarding any exemption from or reduction of property taxes under State and
local laws. Under this final rule, where State or local law grants such an exemption or reduction, HUD will not require
that the applicant establish an escrow account for that portion of the payment of property taxes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the amendment necessitated by subsection 1407(c) is included in the final rule, the Department previously
determined that this provision is effective as of October 28, 1992, the date of enactment of the 1992 HCD Act. HUD Field
Offices were instructed to provide this information upon the request of an applicant or lessee.

Miscellaneous Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule also amends part 291 to reflect changes to the Department's Supportive Housing program. The 1992 HCD
Act terminated the Supportive Housing Demonstration (formerly implemented in 24 CFR parts 577 and 578), and replaced
it with a new Supportive Housing program. An interim rule for that program was published on March 15, 1993 (58 FR 13870),
and is codified at 24 CFR part 583.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Department has made several changes to the proposed rule in this final rule. Those changes are as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. This final rule requires that applicants submit a certification of compliance with fair housing laws, as well as
other nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements, as part of the preapproval process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. In &sect;291.410(d), the references to a 45-day period have been changed to 30-day period. The 45-day reference
was inadvertently put in the proposed rule, and this change reflects a technical correction.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
C. In &sect;291.410(d), and with regard to re-offering a property to an applicant, the rule is changed to provide that
an unsold property will be re-offered to an applicant if no offer from the public has been 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Section 291.410(d) is further modified to show that written notification of interest in a particular property
by the applicant may be sent via facsimile, and the Department encourages applicants to use this method of notification.
Signed leases may also be transmitted in this manner, followed by submission of the original. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Section 291.410(e) has been deleted from the final rule. The Department believes that this provision was redundant
since &sect;291.110, as published on October 20, 1993, in an interim rule amending the Single Family Property Disposition
program, sets forth the same notification procedures. In the interest of simplification and readability, the Department
has removed this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of &sect;291.425 have been changed to indicate that the sales price of any HUD-owned property
acquired under this program will be discounted in an amount determined appropriate by the Secretary, but not less
than 10 percent. This change will make the rule governing the homeless initiative consistent with an amendment to
&sect;291.110(a) in the October 20, 1993 interim rule for the Single Family Property Disposition program.

IV. Discussion of Public Comments From Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received 38 public comments in response to the proposed rule published on August 11, 1993. The following
discussion summarizes the comments and provides HUD's responses to those comments. Every comment was reviewed and
considered, although it may not be specifically addressed in this preamble.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received twenty-one comments objecting to the regulatory change which requires that HUD offer properties
for sale to the public for 30 days prior to making them available for leasing to homeless providers. These commenters
were generally concerned that only the least desirable properties would remain in the inventory after the 30-day
public listing period for a variety of reasons: (a) The increased costs associated with repairing the least desirable
properties; (b) the unsuitability of leasing remainder properties because of problems with accessibility to supportive
services; and (c) the location of remainder properties often being in crime ridden areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1407(a) of the 1992 HCD Act requires that HUD first offer properties to the general public for at least 30 days
before HUD makes such properties available for leasing to homeless providers. However, HUD believes that homeless
providers will have a sufficient number of acceptable properties available for their programs in most housing markets
when the 30 day marketing priority takes effect. This belief is based upon the number of single family properties currently
in the Department's inventory and the number of new acquisitions projected throughout any given year. In addition,
the Department will administer the exception provision of the law with attention to valid concerns of the participating
homeless providers, and if in general a sufficient number of acceptable properties are not available to applicants
after the public listing period, the Department will revisit the exception provision in the future.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters objected to the 200-unit exception to the 30-day public listing period requirement. One commenter
suggested that exceptions be determined based upon the current level of usage of the homeless leasing program in an
area, and input from each field office as to where and whether the exception should apply. One commenter recommended
that the exception to the 30-day public listing period should apply whenever the inventory in a field office is less
than 500 units. One commenter recommended that the Community Planning and Development Division in each field office
work with Property Disposition staff to determine whether the exception to the 30-day listing period requirement
should apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 200 property threshold, which will determine what field offices must offer their inventory to homeless providers
on a priority basis, is based on HUD's experience administering the Homeless Initiative Program nationwide. The
Department believes this is a reasonable benchmark which will ensure adequate property availability for homeless
providers; however, if future program experience demonstrates a need for modification of this criterion to determine
exception areas, the Department will respond appropriately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1407(b) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 requires that HUD consult with units of local
government in determining the area in which properties should be reserved for disposition under the exception to
the 30-day public listing period. Several commenters recommended that HUD give local governments more input into
the program. Eight commenters objected to HUD's exclusion of local communities from reviewing and approving of properties
for the homeless on a case-by-case basis. Eight commenters suggested that HUD require that the program be consistent
with the local CHAS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD has no control over which properties enter its inventory or where they will be located; therefore, there is no guarantee
of property availability in areas designated by the locality for providing services to the homeless. However, in
areas subject to section 1407(b), HUD will consult with local officials on an annual basis to determine which neighborhoods
are targeted by the locality for provision of adequate supportive services necessary to conduct homeless programs.
This consultation will be carried out in a manner to minimize any delay in making HUD owned properties available to
homeless providers. While the language in section 1407(b) of the 1992 HCD Act provides for consultation on ``which
properties should be reserved,'' HUD believes that Congress intended that the Department seek input from local governments
on the specific geographic areas in these communities where the homeless population could best be served rather than
seeking input on a property-by-property basis. Such a process would be administratively burdensome for both HUD
and the unit of local government. HUD will make every effort to work with local governments and applicants; however,
the decision on which properties are available is ultimately determined by the location of properties coming into
inventory.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters objected to the exclusive use of ZIP codes in &sect;291.410 for identifying areas of interest
by homeless providers for leasing properties, and notifying the providers of available properties since many communities
share the same ZIP codes, but not the same housing patterns. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Property listings must be based upon some generally recognized geographic designation that is part of HUD's existing
data base. The Department currently tracks its property acquisitions by ZIP code. Moreover, the Department is not
aware of a better method for tracking and identifying properties. Finally, the Department has not experienced any
difficulties using this approach in the past, nor has it had any complaints regarding this method from program participants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters objected to the absence of fair housing requirements in the rule. These commenters recommended
that HUD require that the homeless providers submit a fair housing action plan and an affirmative marketing plan.
One commenter suggested that the Department require that homeless providers submit a certification of compliance
with fair housing laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since the Department cannot control which properties or what geographic areas are represented in its inventory,
a requirement that participating agencies submit a fair housing action plan and an affirmative marketing plan is
not appropriate. However, the Department requires that all of its programs be administered in a non-discriminatory
manner, and &sect;291.435 expressly makes applicants subject to the Fair Housing Act, as well as other nondiscrimination
and equal opportunity requirements. The Department agrees that applicants should submit a certification of compliance
with applicable fair housing laws. Accordingly, this final rule amends &sect;291.410(c) to require that applicants
submit a certification of compliance with fair housing laws, as well as other nondiscrimination and equal opportunity
requirements, as part of the preapproval process.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters suggested that HUD give local municipalities an opportunity to purchase homes on a more competitive

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department believes that the current pricing structure is appropriate. HUD offers to public agencies and nonprofits
wishing to purchase a HUD-owned property the following discounts: a 10 percent discount off the list price on single
purchases, a 15 percent discount off the list price on the purchase of five or more properties, and a 30 percent discount
off the list price for properties located in certain designated ``revitalization areas.''

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters suggested that HUD change the leasing program to place a greater emphasis on supportive services,
and require that providers set up a reserve account for participants to assist the participants in moving toward independence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees that it is important to place a greater emphasis on the availability of appropriate supportive
services in order to maximize the long term benefits of the Homeless Initiative program; however, requiring that
homeless providers establish reserve accounts to help move tenants towards independence seems overly burdensome
to homeless providers participating in the program at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 291.400(f) currently provides that, to the extent practical and possible, HUD will avoid excessive concentration
in a single neighborhood of properties leased or sold under this program. Although the Department did not propose
to change this provision in the proposed rule, a number of commenters recommended that the Department define ``excessive
concentration'' in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department previously addressed this issue in the final rule published September 16, 1991, where we stated that
``HUD believes that the need to avoid excessive concentration in a single neighborhood is important to the goal of
integrating former homeless persons into the community. However, rigid standards *&blank;*&blank;* would be counterproductive,
and do not recognize the diversity of communities and needs. The need for flexibility outweighs the need to establish
strict standards to ease delivery of supportive services.'' Based upon past experience in this program, the Department
continues to believe that a rigid definition would be counterproductive. Accordingly, the rule is unchanged on this
issue. However, if in the future, this proves to be a problem, the Department will revisit the issue at that time.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter objected to the single family property disposition homeless initiative program in general, arguing
that it is incompatible with local municipal housing patterns, and that leasing PD properties to homeless providers
causes declining property values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There is no evidence that leasing PD properties to homeless providers has caused values to decline. However, in most
housing markets, HUD properties will now be offered first to the general public before being made available for lease
to homeless providers. This should enhance homeownership opportunities, as well as provide greater stability in
residential neighborhoods.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters supported the proposal that HUD limit the number of properties held off market for any applicant
at any one time based upon the applicant's financial capacity and past performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD believes that the number of properties held off the market for an applicant should relate to that applicant's prior
housing experience and demonstrated capacity to administer the program. Field offices currently have the discretion
to determine the appropriate number of properties for any applicant.

HUD's response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 2, 1993 (58 FR 58560), the FHA Commissioner redelegated to field offices the authority to waive handbooks,
notices, directives and other issuances for Housing programs unless a regulatory or statutory provision is involved.
As a result of this redelegation of authority, field offices now have more flexibility in program administration
of the single family property disposition homeless initiative program.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters recommended that HUD change the way it administers the ten percent cap on leasing property to homeless
providers. These commenters believe that leased properties are counted toward the annual ten percent cap each time
their annual lease is renewed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD's response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Properties leased to homeless providers are counted only once against the ten percent of annual inventory cap. Renewal
of a lease does not mean that an individual property is counted twice in one year towards the limitation on the number
of properties which may be leased for this purpose. Moreover, in the past, the Department as a whole has never leased
ten percent of the nationwide inventory to homeless providers, so that individual field offices exceeding their
own ten percent threshold may request reallocation of authority to lease from other areas.

beneficial impact on the formation, maintenance, and general well-being of homeless families, and the amendments
made by this rule will not significantly change the overall impact of the rule on families. Therefore, the rule is not

 (1) HUD will make available up to 10 percent of its total inventory of properties as of October 1, 1993. Thereafter,
on October 1 of each year, the 10 percent figure will be adjusted upward or downward to reflect increases or decreases
in the total inventory. Property will be available for lease under the terms and conditions described in &sect;291.415,
in accordance with the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The property has been listed for sale for at least 30 days, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A sales contract has not been accepted for the property, or the property has not been committed to another program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where a Field Office has 200, or fewer, total properties in inventory on October 1 of each year, and where applicants
have requested to lease properties in certain designated areas, such properties will be offered first to applicants
for lease before being listed for sale to the general public until 10 percent of the total inventory of the Field Office
has been leased. HUD will also take into consideration the number of properties that the Department anticipates acquiring
over the next 12-month period and the speed with which acquired properties are selling in the area. HUD will consult,
on an annual basis, with units of general local government in the area on parts of the area where there is a need for housing
for homeless persons.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notification of eligible properties available for lease.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Applicants, preapproved by HUD as described in paragraph (a) of this section, must designate geographic areas
of interest by ZIP Code to the appropriate HUD Field Office(s), and must indicate their intention to lease properties
in those areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) Upon request, and after properties have been listed for sale to the general public for at least 30 days, except
as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, Field Offices will notify applicants, in writing, of available
eligible properties in the ZIP Code areas previously designated by the applicant. Specific properties selected
by the applicant will be held off the market for a 10-day consideration and inspection period beginning to run upon
notification by the applicant to the Field Office. (Where notification is by mail, the 10-day period will begin to
run five days after mailing.) Only those properties in which the applicant has expressed an interest will be held off
the market. If a signed lease is not received from the applicant by the end of the 10-day consideration and inspection
period, the Field Office will resume offering the properties for sale. (Facsimile (FAX) transmissions are acceptable.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where properties are made available to applicants before being listed for sale to the public, as described in
&sect;291.400(c)(2), upon request, Field Offices will notify applicants, in writing, when eligible properties
become available in the ZIP Code areas previously designated by the applicant. Those properties will remain available
for a 10-day consideration and inspection period before being listed for sale to the public. The 10-day period will
begin to run upon notification of the applicant by the Field Office. (Where notification is by mail, the consideration
period will begin to run five days after mailing.) Applicants must submit a signed lease to the Field Office by the end
of the 10-day period. (Facsimile (FAX) transmissions are acceptable.) If a signed lease is not received by the end
of the 10-day period, the Field Office will offer the properties for sale to the general public. After the initial 10-day
consideration and inspection period, a property will not be available to applicants for lease again until it has been
offered to the public for 30 days. If an applicant expresses an interest in leasing a property during or after the 30-day
public sale period, the Field Office will offer the property to the applicant for 10 days after the public sale period,
provided the property is unsold, no offer from the public has been accepted, and the property is not in a public bid-offering
period or committed to another purpose or program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In notifying applicants of available properties, Field Offices will coordinate the dissemination of the information
to ensure that where more than one applicant designates a specific area, those applicants receive the list of properties
at the same time, based on intervals agreed upon between HUD and the applicants. Properties will be leased or sold to
applicants on a first come-first served basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) HUD may limit the number of properties held off the market for an applicant at any one time, based upon the applicant's
financial capacity and past performance as determined by HUD from information provided in the preapproval process
and observations made during monitoring of a program in progress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
