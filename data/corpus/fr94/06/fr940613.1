Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations specified in 10 CFR Part 9 address the public's right of access to information held by NRC. Subpart
A prescribes procedures for making NRC agency records available to the public for inspection and copying under the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and provides notice of procedures for obtaining NRC records otherwise publicly
available. Subpart B implements the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 with respect to the procedures by which individuals
may determine the existence of, seek access to, and request correction of NRC records concerning themselves. Subpart
B also covers the requirements applicable to NRC personnel with respect to the use and dissemination of such records.

The Petitioner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 10, 1994, OCRE filed a petition for rulemaking under 10 CFR 2.802 with the NRC. OCRE filed an amendment to
the petition on April 11, 1994. The petitioner is a private, not-for-profit organization incorporated under the
laws of the State of Ohio. OCRE specializes in research and advocacy on nuclear safety issues and supports the highest
standards of safety and environmental protection. OCRE also supports the right of meaningful public participation
in the regulation of nuclear facilities. The petitioner was an intervenor in the operating license proceeding for
the Perry Nuclear Power Plant and has intervened in three operating license amendment cases regarding Perry.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Reasons for the Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the petitioner, the purpose of the petition is to request a change to the rules regarding public access
to information as stated in 10 CFR part 9, particularly information that is held by licensees but is not submitted to
the NRC. OCRE contends that it has observed a trend in the NRC's regulatory practice in the past several years that decreases
the amount of information to which the public has access. The petitioner believes that this trend is apparent in NRC
bulletins and generic letters issued over the past six years. OCRE states that these documents instruct licensees
to send conclusory statements that they have completed the requested actions to the NRC instead of instructing licensees
to send the NRC detailed documentation and analyses of their actions. The detailed records are kept at the plant site
where they are accessible only to NRC inspectors. The petitioner is particularly concerned because if these materials
are never sent to the NRC, they will not get into the Public Document Room and the public will never have access to them.
OCRE further states that the materials will not even be obtainable under the FOIA unless an NRC inspector happens to
make a copy of the requested documents and the documents are still in the agency's possession at the time the FOIA request
is filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCRE refers to the Station Blackout rule in &sect;50.63(a)(2), which states that ``the capability for coping with
a station blackout of specified duration shall be determined by an appropriate coping analysis. Utilities are expected
to have the baseline assumptions, analyses, and related information used in their coping evaluations available
for NRC review.'' It is not apparent to the petitioner that this material is actually sent to the NRC and made publicly
available.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner believes that other regulatory trends are also decreasing public access to information. OCRE states
that the Technical Specification Improvement Program encourages the removal of material from the plant technical
specifications and the relocation of it to internal plant documents. The petitioner included a list of recent generic
letters that enable licensees to relocate material from the plant technical specifications, a public document,
into other plant documents that may not be available to the public. According to the petitioner, about 36 percent of
current technical specification material will be relocated to internal plant documents under this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that NRC's revised rules of practice place an even greater burden on public petitioners to provide
as much documentation and factual basis for contentions as early as possible while the access of petitioners to detailed
information is diminishing. The petitioner further states that if detailed information is never submitted to the
NRC, and thus never becomes accessible to the public, participants in proceedings will never be able to supply a basis
sufficient to support admission of contentions under the new rules of practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCRE believes that lack of public access to information on nuclear regulation undermines public confidence in the
NRC's regulatory program and is contrary to the public's statutory right to participate in the NRC regulatory process.
The petitioner also states that members of the public cannot fulfill the role of participating in the NRC regulatory
process, which Congress has bestowed upon them, without access to the detailed information that current NRC policies
are placing beyond the public's reach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the amendment to the petition, OCRE cited two additional examples of the lack of public access to licensee-held
information. The first example is NRC's proposed rule entitled ``Codes and Standards for Nuclear Power Plants; Subsection
IWE and Subsection IWL'' (59 FR 979, January 7, 1994), which states that ``In order to further reduce the burden on licensees
and NRC staff, the Subsection IWE and IWL portions of the ISI plan will not have to be submitted to the NRC for approval.
Licensees may simply retain their initial Subsection IWE and Subsection IWL plans at the site for audit.'' The second
example is NRC's final rule entitled ``Storage of Spent Fuel in NRC-Approved Storage Casks at Power Reactor Sites''
(55 FR 29161, July 18, 1990) which does not appear to require nuclear power plant users of the approved storage casks
to submit their site-specific evaluations, as required by &sect;72.212(b)(2), to the NRC. This section states that
``A copy of this record must be retained until spent fuel is no longer stored under the general license issued under
&sect;72.210.'' The petitioner further states that &sect;72.212(b)(10) only requires that general licensees
make records available to the NRC for inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the amendment to the petition, the petitioner amended the language in its suggested &sect;9.301(b) to include
persons required by the proposed rule entitled ``Certification of Gaseous Diffusion Plants,'' published on February
11, 1994 (59 FR 6792), to obtain NRC certification of gaseous diffusion plants under proposed Part 76 in the definition
of ``possessor.'' OCRE requests that the NRC clarify that this proposed definition would include entities authorized
to dispose of radioactive materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner recommends a change to Part 9 to establish the public's right-to-know and to provide the public access
to copies of internal plant documents, subject to the exceptions necessary to protect sensitive information. The
suggested amendment would not require that licensees generate information that does not already exist in response
to a request. The petitioner believes that its suggested amendment would strike a proper balance between the public's
right to know and the rights of the licensees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner's suggested amendment would include appeal procedures. If a
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 requester is not satisfied with a licensee's response to a request for information, the requester could appeal the
matter to an Administrative Law Judge on the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel. According to the petitioner,
this option is the most appropriate and efficient one for appeals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCRE believes that its suggested amendment to Part 9 would impose a minimal burden on licensees and that this minor
burden would be justified by the substantial increase in meaningful public participation. According to the petitioner,
the proposed amendment to Part 9 would also enhance the public's confidence in the NRC's regulatory program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board is publishing for public comment proposed changes to Regulation C (Home Mortgage Disclosure) and to the
instructions and reporting forms that financial institutions must use in complying with the annual reporting requirements
under the regulation. The principal reasons for the proposed amendments are to respond to the statutory provisions
regarding earlier availability of the HMDA disclosure statements to the public; help improve the quality of the HMDA
data; and provide clarifications requested by financial institutions that report under HMDA. The amendments would
set an earlier deadline for reporting HMDA data to supervisory agencies; require reporting in machine-readable
format; require institutions to keep their loan application registers current during the year as data are being collected;
and make a number of other changes.

(1) Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Board's Regulation C (12 CFR part 203) implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 (HMDA) (12 U.S.C. 2801

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The regulation requires most mortgage lenders located in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) to report annually
to federal supervisory agencies, and disclose to the public, information about their home mortgage and home improvement
lending activity. The reports and disclosures cover loan originations, applications that do not result in originations
(for example, applications that are denied or withdrawn), and purchases of loans. Information reported includes
the location of the property to which the loan or application relates; the race or national origin, gender, and income
of the applicant; and the type of purchaser for loans sold in the secondary market. For denied applications, lenders
are also permitted to report the reasons for denial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lenders are required to report originations, applications, and purchased loans for each calendar year to their supervisory
agency by March 1 of the following year. The reports are made on a HMDA Loan/Application Register (HMDA&hyph;LAR)
in a transaction-by-transaction format; for reports containing more than 100 entries, lenders currently are expected
to submit the data in automated form (magnetic tape or diskette). The lender's supervisory agency submits the data
to the Federal Reserve Board, which processes the data on behalf of member agencies of the Federal Financial Institutions
Examination Council (FFIEC) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Board then prepares public
disclosure statements for each reporting lender and aggregate reports covering the data for all lenders in a metropolitan
area. The statements are sent to lenders, generally by July or August, and the lenders are required to make the statements
available to the public at their home office and at certain branch offices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although lenders must make the disclosure statements available within three business days, they have a thirty-day
period within which to review the statements prepared by the Board and to report any discrepancies to the agencies.
After necessary revisions have been made, the Board prepares and sends disclosure statements for all reporting lenders
in each MSA, along with aggregate disclosure tables covering all such lenders, to a central data depository in each
MSA. The central depositories are usually public libraries, regional planning agencies, or other public offices;
the disclosures are generally sent to the depositories by October.

(2) Explanation of Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the principal reasons the Board is proposing to amend Regulation C is the need to make HMDA data available to the
public earlier than has been the case in the past. Statutory amendments to HMDA enacted in 1992 provide that starting
with the HMDA reports for calendar year 1994, disclosure statements for individual lenders should be available to
the public by July 1 of the following year, and that aggregate tables should be available at the central depositories
by September 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To meet this timetable, it will be necessary for the agencies to begin processing the raw data earlier than March 1.
Therefore, the proposed amendments include a change in the deadline for data submission, requiring lenders to submit
their data by February 1 instead of March 1. Some of the other proposed amendments also are intended, in part, to facilitate
earlier availability of the data (see discussion concerning the proposed change to &sect;203.5(a), below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another important reason the Board is proposing amendments to Regulation C relates to the accuracy of the HMDA data.
The accuracy of the HMDA reports produced under the new data collection system that was instituted in 1990 (following
an expansion of the data collected under HMDA) has improved in each succeeding year, but concerns continue to exist
about data quality. A major part of what is involved in ensuring data accuracy relates to matters that are in the control
of reporting institutions; for example, lending institutions must devote adequate resources to the task of accurately
compiling and checking data before reporting it. However, to the extent that any requirements of the regulation are
unclear or complicated, consistent and accurate reporting is more difficult. Accordingly, some of the proposed
amendments now being published are intended in whole or in part to make the reporting requirements clearer or simpler.
In addition, another proposed amendment calls for reporting in machine-readable format; this change also should
help improve data quality, as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board solicits comment generally on other ways in which Regulation C might be changed to better address problems
of accuracy of the HMDA data. For example, would allowing or requiring all home equity lines to be reported_rather
than only the portion of a line the borrower intends to use for home improvement or home purchase_simplify reporting
and bring about greater consistency? Would the same be true for other categories of loans? (On a similar point, refer
to the discussion of possible changes in the types of refinancings that should be reported, in section (3), ``Other
Matters on Which the Board Solicits Comment,'' below.) Are there areas in which explanations could be made simpler
or clearer, thereby facilitating more accurate reporting? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board notes its intention to publish within the next several months a proposed staff commentary to Regulation
C. The commentary will provide a vehicle for interpretations that would help lenders better understand and comply
with the regulation's requirements. The commentary will supplement the detailed instructions provided in appendix
A to Regulation C for completion of the HMDA-LAR and in the Guide to HMDA Reporting: Getting It Right, the brochure published
by the FFIEC and distributed by the individual agencies. The Board is in the process of drafting the commentary, and
solicits comment from lenders identifying specific areas that the commentary should address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Set forth below is a section-by-section discussion of the proposed amendments to the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 203.2_Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f)_Home Improvement Loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would revise the regulation's definition of ``home improvement loan'' to facilitate compliance. The
existing definition sets two conditions: first, that the loan applicant state, at the time of the application, that
the loan is for the purpose of repairing, rehabilitating, or remodeling a dwelling; and second, that the loan be classified
in the records of the financial institution as a home improvement loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One change proposed by the Board relates to the first part of the definition_that the loan be for the purpose of repairing,
rehabilitating, or remodeling a dwelling. Questions have arisen about situations in which a loan is made for the purpose
of making improvements to the borrower's residential property, but not, strictly speaking, to the ``dwelling''
as defined under Regulation C. The regulation defines dwelling as a residential structure, whether or not attached
to real property. Thus, for example, a dwelling under Regulation C includes a house, apartment building, or mobile
home, but not necessarily the land upon which the house or other structure is located. Some institutions have asked
whether a loan for building or repairing things such as a detached garage, a driveway, a fence, or landscaping should
qualify as a home improvement loan for HMDA purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To avoid technical distinctions based on whether a loan relates to the structure or to the land on which it is situated,
the Board proposes to change the home improvement loan definition to focus primarily on the applicant's statement
of purpose for the loan. Thus, a loan would qualify as a home improvement loan for HMDA purposes if the applicant states,
at the time of the loan application, that the loan is for ``home improvement purposes.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board also proposes to eliminate the second part of the definition, which would make the manner in which an institution
classifies a loan irrelevant to its treatment for HMDA purposes. This part of the definition was originally intended
to minimize the regulatory burden on financial institutions, by not requiring an institution to report a loan as a
home improvement loan on its HMDA-LAR if the institution did not record the loan as a home improvement loan for other
purposes. Many institutions now indicate that they would like to report loans that in fact are for home improvement
purposes, but they find it difficult to do so because the loans may not be ``classified'' in the institution's records
as home improvement loans. Removing the classification test would resolve this problem. However, the Board solicits
comment on the extent to which this proposed change would create significant compliance burdens for institutions
that do not currently record such loans on the HMDA&hyph;LAR but now would be required to do so. Comment is also requested
generally on the overall advantages and disadvantages of making this change.

Maintenance of LARs on current basis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation currently requires covered institutions to report HMDA data for a given calendar year to supervisory
agencies by March 1 of the following year, but does not specify when the data must be recorded on the HMDA&hyph;LAR.
The Board proposes to require institutions to fully record transactions within one month after final action is taken
(such as origination of a loan, or denial or withdrawal of an application). The Board believes this approach would
help in improving the accuracy and timeliness of the HMDA data. Current-year registers would be available to examiners
so that, if problems were occurring, the supervisory agency could work with the institution to ensure that errors
were corrected well before the relatively brief period between the end of the year and the reporting deadline. Another
advantage of the proposed change would be that examiners and the institution itself would have ready access to current
data that could be helpful in assessing its fair lending and community reinvestment performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board recognizes that some institutions may compile and geocode transactions (assign MSA, state, county, and
census tract codes) on a batch basis, from time to time during the year or at year-end. The Board solicits comment on
how burdensome institutions that currently follow this procedure would find it to record all the LAR information,
including the geographic codes, on the HMDA&hyph;LAR within one month after final action. In addition, comment is
requested on the extent to which any burden might be reduced if the requirement were to keep the HMDA&hyph;LAR up to
date on a quarterly basis, rather than monthly. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation imposes a thirty-day requirement
on the HMDA-covered institutions it supervises; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency proposed a similar
requirement, and recently adopted a quarterly update requirement instead (see 59 FR 26411, May 20, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that a requirement to update the HMDA_LAR within one month after each transaction would be an important
step toward improving the accuracy and timeliness of HMDA data reporting; if the compliance burden appeared to outweigh
the advantages, however, the Board would consider alternatives such as quarterly updating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting income. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposes to revise the regulation to clarify how institutions report applicants' income and eliminate
an internal inconsistency that now exists. Currently, &sect;203.4(a)(7) of Regulation C provides that financial
institutions shall collect data on ``income relied upon in processing the loan application.'' The instructions
for completing the HMDA&hyph;LAR state that if no income is asked for or relied on in the credit decision, the lender
may enter NA (not applicable) in this field (appendix A, paragraph V.D.5.c.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board proposes that lenders must report all income reflected on the application, including income of coapplicants,
whether or not the lender relies on a particular source of income. If the lender determined, in the course of verifying
information, that some portion of the income reported by the applicant was overstated, the lender would enter the
verified amount rather than the amount originally reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently lenders need not report income for streamlined refinancings in which they neither ask for nor rely on income
information. In addition, for privacy reasons, an institution need not record applicants' income on the HMDA&hyph;LAR
for loans made to the institution's own employees. These rules will remain in place.

Change in reporting deadline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Currently, institutions are required to file their HMDA data with supervisory agencies by March 1 following the year
to which the data relate. The Board proposes to change the due date to February 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statutory amendments contained in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, 106 Stat. 3889, provide that
starting with loan and application data for calendar year 1994, the FFIEC shall make ``every effort'' to ensure that
individual lenders' public disclosure statements are available at the lenders' offices before July 1 of the following
year. Similarly, the amendments call for the FFIEC to make both the individual disclosures and the aggregate tables
available at the central depositories before September 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the individual lenders' disclosure statements for 1992 lending activity became available to the public
the first week of August, and the disclosure statements and aggregate reports became available at central depositories
the first week of November. This year, the processing schedule calls for disclosures to be available at institutions
in July and at central depositories in October. Thus, progress is being made toward meeting the statutory targets
for earlier availability of HMDA data. But given the high volume of data being processed, the Board believes it is necessary
to move up the date for submitting the raw data to supervisory agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting in Machine-Readable Format. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In processing the HMDA data, the Board and the other agencies use various means to identify and correct data errors.
For example, the data are run through computerized edit checks designed to detect errors and omissions in the data
fields. Where these are found, the agencies send the reports back to the institution for correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lenders whose HMDA&hyph;LAR contains more than 100 line entries are generally expected by the agencies to submit
their data in machine-readable format, such as PC diskette or magnetic tape. The Board and the other agencies have
encouraged lenders to submit their HMDA&hyph;LARs in automated form, and all but one of the agencies provide PC software
that can be used to compile data on diskettes. This software has built-in edit checks for accuracy and is furnished
free of charge. Software packages that are widely available from private vendors also contain the computerized edits
used by the Board. Nonetheless, many lending institutions still submit their HMDA data in paper form, and the agencies
have found that these paper submissions tend to contain a substantially higher number of errors than submissions
in machine-readable form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board proposes to require that all institutions report HMDA data in machine-readable form and that they edit their
data before submitting it, either using the agency-supplied HMDA software or using the same edits in private vendors'
software. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change would help lenders to ensure submission of accurate data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overall accuracy of the data has improved each year since 1990, the first year of expanded reporting under the amendments
in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, in part because institutions have increasingly
submitted data by diskette, magnetic tape, or Fedline. However, further improvements in data quality are needed,
and the pre-edited reporting of data in machine-readable form would help in bringing about such improvements. Machine-readable
reporting would also assist the agencies in meeting the new public disclosure deadlines, by reducing the time needed
to enter the data from each reporting institution into the HMDA processing database. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board recognizes that some financial institutions subject to HMDA might not have the computer capability to compile
and report their data in machine-readable form. The Board solicits comment, therefore, on whether requiring machine-readable
data submission from all institutions would create a hardship for some, and if so, whether supervisory agencies should
have discretion to grant waivers from this requirement on a case-by-case basis. For example, a waiver might be granted
in a case where an institution does not itself own or have ready access to a personal computer nor have access through
a service provider.

Paragraph (e)_Notice of Availability

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposes to make a technical change to &sect;203.5(e) concerning the notice of availability that institutions
are required to post. Pursuant to amendments contained in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, lending
institutions must now make available to the public not only their disclosure statements but also their loan/application
registers (after deleting certain data fields). These statutory amendments were incorporated into Regulation
C in March 1993 (see 58 FR 13403, March 11, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will revise the notice language to reflect that HMDA data in addition to disclosure statements
are available from institutions.

Paragraphs B and C._
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Requirement to report total HMDA&hyph;LAR entries on transmittal sheet. The regulation requires that a transmittal
sheet accompany an institution's HMDA&hyph;LAR data submission, containing general information such as the name,
address, and identifying numbers of the institution. Currently, the transmittal sheet does not ask for the total
number of transaction line entries contained in the HMDA submission, although the instructions encourage institutions
to provide this record count in a cover letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board proposes to amend Regulation C to require financial institutions to report on the transmittal sheet (in
both the paper-copy and machine-readable versions) the total number of line entries included in the data submission.
Respondents also will be asked to send a transmittal sheet with any subsequent submission of data, rather than only
with the initial submission. An institution will sometimes send HMDA data to its supervisory agency in more than one
submission when revisions to the initial submission are necessary, for example, or because transactions were found
to have been inadvertently omitted. The count on the transmittal sheet for each submission will help the agencies
verify the number of line entries submitted by the institution at that time. This change would help reduce the likelihood
of any data being lost during the collection process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board is providing suggested language for the notice of availability that lenders are required to post in their
home and branch offices in metropolitan areas. The revised notice reflects the fact that HMDA data besides disclosure
statements are now available from financial institutions. See the discussion of proposed changes to &sect;203.5(e),
above.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application or loan information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 5. Explanation of purpose codes. Code 2: Home improvement. The proposal includes changes in the definition of home
improvement loans for HMDA reporting purposes. The HMDA&hyph;LAR instructions would be revised to reflect the proposed
changes. See the discussion of home improvement loan issues under &sect;203.2(f), above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Loan amount. f. Reporting counteroffers. The proposal clarifies that counteroffers are to be reported as loan
denials if the applicant does not accept the counteroffer, not as applications withdrawn or approved but not accepted.
This clarification conforms with the treatment of counteroffers in Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Property location.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 5. Outside MSA. Financial institutions are encouraged but not required to enter geographic information for loans
on property located outside the MSAs in which they have a home or branch office (or outside any MSA). The proposed rule
clarifies that, if a lender enters data in the property location fields of the HMDA&hyph;LAR for these loans, the data
must accurately reflect the location of the property in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Other Matters on Which the Board Solicits Comment. In addition to seeking comment on the proposed amendments,
the Board solicits comment on other matters related to HMDA reporting: prequalification programs, refinancing
transactions, and the collection of racial or ethnic information, as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Prequalification programs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regulation C requires lenders to compile and report data on applications for loans as well as on loan originations.
The Board has received questions about mortgage lenders' prequalification programs, asking whether and when a request
for prequalification must be treated as a credit application for purposes of HMDA reporting. The answer depends on
the outcome of the prequalification decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of application under HMDA is virtually identical to the definition established by the Board's Regulation
B (Equal Credit Opportunity). Accordingly, lenders are directed to the guidance provided in the Official Staff Commentary
to Regulation B, comments 2(f)&hyph;1 through &hyph;4, on differentiating between applications and inquiries.
The commentary states that if a lender_in giving information to a consumer_evaluates information about the consumer,
decides to decline a credit request, and communicates this to the consumer, the creditor has treated that inquiry
as an application for credit (by virtue of having made a credit decision). In the case of Regulation B, the creditor
must then comply with the notification rules on adverse action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to HMDA reporting, the same rule applies, and a lender that turns down a prequalification request (because
of the homebuyer's poor credit history, for example) must report it as a loan denial on its HMDA&hyph;LAR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prequalification requests that are approved, on the other hand, will be reported on the HMDA&hyph;LAR at a later stage
in the process, after homebuyers have found the property they want to purchase and the lender has evaluated a formal
loan application, not at the time of the prequalification approval. Thus, the lender will report when: (1) the lender
originates a loan; (2) the lender has made a firm loan offer that the applicant does not accept; (3) the applicant expressly
withdraws the mortgage application; (4) the lender closes the file for incompleteness; or (5) the lender denies the
mortgage loan application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, lender decisions on prequalifications that are approved may ultimately not be reported on the HMDA&hyph;LAR;
if a homebuyer who has been prequalified for credit does not later pursue a formal application for a mortgage loan,
the lender has no reporting obligations under HMDA (and no notification requirements under Regulation B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For denials of prequalification requests that are reportable under HMDA, there are questions about how a lender can
comply with the reporting requirements with regard to the loan amount, loan type, and property location data fields
on the HMDA&hyph;LAR. Generally speaking, a property location will not ``exist'' at the prequalification stage
if the prospective homebuyer does not yet have a purchase contract on, or has not requested financing for, a specific
property. Thus, the lender should enter NA (not applicable) in each of the location fields in such instances. For loan
amount, if the prospective homebuyer has not requested a particular amount of credit, the regulation currently does
not provide any alternative code. The Board requests comment on whether a code such as NA (not applicable) will suffice,
or whether a special code_indicating that the transaction is a prequalification_would be more appropriate and useful.
Similar issues arise with respect to loan type in cases where prospective borrowers have not specified during the
prequalification process the type of loan they are seeking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board requests comment about other compliance issues related to prequalifications, and contemplates that guidance
regarding these matters will be provided in the commentary to Regulation C to be issued later this year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting of refinancings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation requires lenders to report refinancings, which are defined as loans involving the satisfaction of
an existing obligation and its replacement by a new obligation undertaken by the same borrower. The Board solicits
comment on the reporting of transactions that are not technically refinancings, but that serve as the functional
equivalent of refinancings. In some regions, transactions are structured as modifications of existing obligations
(sometimes called modification, extension, and consolidation agreements or ``MECAs''), rather than as replacements
thereof, often in order to reduce borrower costs associated with a refinancing (for example, title insurance fees).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions have inquired whether they should report such transactions, which serve the same purpose as refinancings
and normally entail the same underwriting procedures. The Board solicits comment on this matter. The Board also solicits
comment on what types of modifications should not be subject to reporting (such as the simple modification of a loan
term from 25 to 15 years), as well as the basis for any such distinctions. Other issues on which comment is requested
include whether the reporting of such transactions should be limited to cases where a new lender is offering the modification,
or should also be available to the original lender. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another matter on which the Board seeks comment concerns the current exclusion for certain refinancings based on
the purpose of the transaction. Under existing Regulation C, a refinancing is to be reported only if the loan being
refinanced was a home purchase or home improvement loan, or was a refinancing of such a loan. In addition, a refinancing
is reported only if the amount outstanding on the loan being refinanced, plus the amount of any new money for home purchase
or home improvement purposes, is equal to more than 50 percent of the total new loan amount. For example, if a borrower
refinances a home purchase loan only for the purpose of getting a lower interest rate on the outstanding balance, and
therefore does not obtain any new money, the refinancing is reported because the amount outstanding on the original
loan is equal to 100 percent of the new loan amount. Similarly, if a borrower refinances a home purchase loan and obtains
new money to be used entirely for home improvement purposes, then again the refinancing is reported because here again,
the amount outstanding plus new money for ``covered purposes'' (home improvement and home purchase) is equal to 100
percent of the new loan amount. At the other extreme, if a borrower refinances a loan with an outstanding balance of
$20,000 and obtains $40,000 of new money to be used for starting a new business, the refinancing is not reported because
the amount outstanding plus new money for ``covered purposes'' is equal to only one-third of the new loan amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This purpose test for determining whether refinancings are to be reported under Regulation C has generated a substantial
number of questions from lenders. For example, the purpose of the loan being refinanced may not be clear at the time
the borrower applies for the refinancing. In some cases, a loan has been refinanced repeatedly, new money having been
obtained each time; and the calculations necessary to determine whether more than 50 percent of the total new loan
amount is for covered purposes become difficult. An alternative approach that would be easier to understand and apply
would be to treat all refinancings as subject to reporting on the HMDA&hyph;LAR. Although such an expansion in coverage
would result in the disclosed data's being less tied to the home purchase and home improvement categories, it is not
clear that the resulting data would be less useful. The Board solicits comment on the advantages and disadvantages
of these changes, both for reporting institutions and for users of HMDA data.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Collection of racial or ethnic information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulation C provides that applicants for mortgage and home improvement loans be requested, but not required, to
provide information about their race or national origin, gender, and income. The purpose is to gather data that may
help regulatory agencies to gauge whether a lending institution is complying with the fair lending laws. If an applicant
chooses not to provide the information on race or national origin and gender, the loan officer is required to enter
the information on the basis of visual observation or surname. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the categories in Regulation C for data collection on race/national origin of applicants are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;American Indian or Alaskan Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Asian or Pacific Islander 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Black 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Hispanic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;White 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The categories that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issues for government statistical purposes are substantially
the same, except that the ``other'' category is not included. OMB and others have indicated their belief that the presence
of the ``other'' category undercuts the usefulness of the data, in that a data user has no way of knowing what the category
represents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In adopting the monitoring provisions of Regulation C in 1989, the Board based the categories used on Regulation B,
which has contained the ``other'' category since it was first adopted by the Board in 1976. The Board believed that
the ``other'' category served a useful function. For example, it provides a choice to applicants who do not identify
with any of the specifically defined categories; in 1992, the ``other'' category was used in roughly 45,000 out of
10 million loan records. The Board notes also that OMB is likely in the next few years to propose changing the list of
categories for the next decennial census. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment is solicited on whether the Board should consider deleting the ``other'' category. The Board notes that if
this change were made for Regulation C, a parallel change would be made in the monitoring provisions of Regulation
B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(4) Economic Impact Statement. The Board's Division of Research and Statistics has prepared an economic impact analysis
of the proposed amendments. A copy of the analysis may be obtained from Publications Services, Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, or by telephone at (202) 452&hyph;3245.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule would require FDIC-insured mutual state-chartered savings banks that are not members of the Federal
Reserve System (State Savings Banks) to comply with new substantive provisions of the FDIC's regulations when proposing
to convert to the stock form of ownership. The intended effect of the proposed rule is to assure that certain aspects
of mutual-to-stock conversions of FDIC-regulated institutions do not engender safety-and-soundness concerns,
breaches of fiduciary duty or other violations of law.

II. Recent FDIC Regulatory Initiatives on Mutual-To-Stock Conversions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recent years numerous mutually owned State Savings Banks have converted to stockholder-owned State Savings Banks.
Many of the institutions that converted from mutual to stock form first converted from federal or state mutual savings
associations regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) to State Savings Banks. One consequence of these
conversions to State Savings Banks is that the FDIC replaces the OTS as the institution's primary federal regulator.
Mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks are generally subject to the rules and entitled to the protections
of the applicable state law.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conversion rules under state law are not identical to and in some cases are less stringent than OTS regulations. The
absence of consistent treatment under state laws and the lack of some federal oversight of State Savings Bank mutual-to-stock
conversions present an opportunity for inconsistency and abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of concerns about prior and potential abuses in the conversion process, on February 1, 1994, the FDIC issued
for public comment a proposed policy statement on the conversions of State Savings Banks from mutual to stock ownership
(Proposed Policy Statement). 59 FR 4712. The general purpose of the Proposed Policy Statement was to solicit public
comment on the issues involved in mutual-to-stock conversions and whether and how the FDIC should regulate this activity.
The areas of FDIC concern identified in the Proposed Policy Statement were: (1) Proper appraisal of the institution
to be sold; (2) proper pricing of the stock sold in the conversion; (3) fair apportionment of the stock subscription
rights; (4) adequate disclosure of information needed to make an informed investment decision; and (5) non-abusive
compensation and benefits provided to insiders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the issuance of the Proposed Policy Statement the Board of Directors of the FDIC (Board) determined
that during the pendency of the Proposed Policy Statement it was necessary for the FDIC to review applications filed
by State Savings Banks with their respective state banking regulator and any other applicable state and federal banking
and/or securities regulators to determine whether the proposed conversions contain any safety and soundness issues
and/or issues of insider abuse that reflect negatively on the integrity and competence of the management of the converting
institution. The Board's concerns were caused by several recent and pending mutual-to-stock conversions of State
Savings Banks that had given rise to questions related to management abuse and excessive enrichment of insiders,
fairness to depositors and general safety and soundness concerns. These conversions have recently been the subject
of Congressional hearings and numerous news articles and reports. The FDIC also had received (and continues to receive)
direct complaints from depositors of State Savings Banks about unfair treatment and insider abuse in mutual-to-stock
conversions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, on February 15, 1994, the FDIC issued an interim final rule adding a new section to Part 303 of the FDIC's regulations
(to be published at 12 CFR 303.15) prohibiting State Savings Banks from converting to stock form without complying
with the requirements of the interim rule (Interim Rule). 59 FR 7194. The Interim Rule requires State Savings Banks
that propose to convert to stock ownership to file with the FDIC a notice of intent to convert to stock form consisting
of a description of the proposed conversion accompanied by a copy of all documentation and application materials
filed with the applicable state and federal regulators. Pursuant to the Interim Rule, the FDIC currently reviews
all conversion materials regarding State Savings Banks with a special interest in: The use of the proceeds from the
sale of stock, as prescribed in the business plan; the adequacy of the disclosure materials; the participation of
depositors in approving the transaction; the form of the proxy statement required for the vote of the depositors/members
on the conversion; any increased compensation and other remuneration (including stock grants, stock option rights
and other similar benefits) to be obtained by officers and trustees of the bank in connection with the conversion;
the adequacy and independence of the appraisal of the value of the mutual savings bank for purposes of determining
the price of the shares of stock to be sold; the process by which the bank's trustees approved the appraisal, the pricing
of the stock and the compensation arrangements for insiders; the nature and apportionment of stock subscription
rights; and the extent of any existing and planned contributions to or investments in the community. In a proposed
merger/conversion, the FDIC pays particular attention to the value offered to depositors of the converting institution
and the compensation packages offered to management.

As indicated in the Interim Rule, the FDIC generally expects proposed conversions to substantially satisfy the standards
found in the mutual-to-stock conversion regulations of the OTS (12 CFR Part 563b). Any variance from those regulations
is closely scrutinized. As also indicated in the Interim Rule, however, compliance with OTS requirements is not necessarily
sufficient for FDIC regulatory purposes. The Interim Rule specifies that the FDIC will look to the OTS rules ``currently
in effect'' at the time the FDIC reviews the proposed conversion. As indicated below, the OTS recently revised its
mutual-to-stock conversion regulations. Thus, upon the issuance of the OTS revised regulations on May 3, 1994 (59
FR 22725), the FDIC began taking into account the extent to which proposed conversions of State Savings Banks conform
with the various provisions of the OTS' revised regulations. The Interim Rule remains effective during the pendency
of this proposed rulemaking.

III. Comments Received on the Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing and issuing this proposed rule it was helpful for the FDIC staff and the Board to consider the comments
received on the Proposed Policy Statement and the Interim Rule. It is anticipated that the Board will again consider
those comments when taking final action on the Proposed Policy Statement and the Interim Rule. Some issues identified
and discussed in the comments are not germane to the proposed rule, but may be relevant when the Board takes final action
on the Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Rule; thus, although they are mentioned briefly in the summary of comments
provided below, those issues are not otherwise discussed in the context of this proposed rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Proposed Policy Statement and the Interim Rule the FDIC specifically requested comment on, among other issues:
What abuses are prevalent in mutual-to-stock conversions and why the FDIC should take action against such abuses;
whether federal oversight in conversions of State Savings Banks is necessary; whether the FDIC should issue a regulation
closely following the OTS conversion regulations or the FDIC should take a less formal approach; whether the FDIC
should seek Congressional action in this area; and the mechanics and substantive provisions of the Interim Rule.

IV. Need for the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recently the OTS revised its mutual-to-stock conversion regulations primarily to address immediate concerns about
excessive management remuneration and inadequate depositor participation in conversions of savings associations
(59 FR 22725 (May 3, 1994)) (OTS Revisions). In essence, the new regulations attempt to prevent management abuses
by strengthening the rights of depositors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC believes that the OTS Revisions are a necessary, sound first step in correcting certain abuses stemming from
conversions and that the absence of some federal oversight of mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks
presents an opportunity for inconsistency and abuse. Thus, the FDIC thinks it may be necessary and appropriate to
adopt regulations similar to the OTS Revisions. For these reasons, as discussed below, the FDIC is issuing this proposed
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the fundamental problem concerning the distribution of existing economic value in mutual-to-stock conversions
is not addressed by the OTS Revisions, however, the Board believes other forms of abuse may still arise. The FDIC believes
that it is necessary to re-examine the conversion process to explore whether the existing economic value of a converting
mutual institution can be better distributed directly to those who should receive it.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC is particularly concerned about the appraisals of converting institutions. The FDIC believes that under
the current process it may be difficult to prepare an appraisal of a well capitalized mutual institution which accurately
reflects ``pro forma value'' while at the same time reflecting the appraised value cogently in a business plan of the
institution. The incidence of significant appreciation in the stock price immediately after the initial public
offering, which tends to exceed the stock appreciation of initial public offerings in other industries, suggests
that appraisals may be too low. As a possible consequence of underpricing the institution, insiders may be able to
acquire more shares than they are entitled to; moreover, a low appraisal may deprive an institution of the additional
capital it should receive in the sale of conversion stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address the possible need for fundamental changes to the mutual-to-stock conversions process, concurrently
with the publication of this proposed rule, the Board also is publishing a request for comments on ways to address concerns
about the overall conversion process (Request For Comments). The Request For Comments is a separate notice contained
elsewhere in this issue of the

V. Explanation of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would impose several specific requirements upon State Savings Banks that propose to undergo mutual-to-stock
conversions. The proposed requirements are similar to the OTS Revisions. Currently and during the pendency of this
proposed rulemaking, the FDIC intends to continue to use the case-by-case methodology explained in the Interim Rule
in reviewing notices of proposed conversions of State Savings Banks. As noted above and in the Interim Rule, this FDIC
review includes an analysis of whether the proposed conversion would comply with current OTS mutual-to-stock conversions
rules. Subsequent to the adoption of a final rule, the FDIC intends to continue to use a case-by-case approach in reviewing
aspects of proposed conversions that are outside the scope of the specific requirements in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among other things, the proposed rule also would indicate that the requirements thereof apply, to the extent appropriate,
to the reorganization of State Savings banks to the mutual holding company form of ownership. The FDIC also is involved
in the mutual holding company reorganizations of federal and state savings associations. That involvement entails
FDIC action on the application for deposit insurance required to be filed with the FDIC in such transactions for the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de novo 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
stock depository institution organized to facilitate the reorganization. In acting on applications for deposit
insurance the FDIC must consider the factors listed in section 6 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1816),
one of which is the ``general character and fitness of the management of the depository institution.'' In the course
of that review the FDIC considers, among other things, the same issues of fiduciary duty that it considers in reviewing
proposed mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed below, preliminarily, the FDIC believes that each of the requirements in the proposed rule is necessary
to satisfy specific FDIC concerns about safety and soundness and/or breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with
mutual-to-stock conversions. At the same time, the FDIC believes that it is essential to consider the existence of
state regulation and supervision in determining the proper role in the conversion process for the FDIC as the primary
federal regulator of State Savings Banks. As discussed below, many of the comments that the FDIC received on the Proposed
Policy Statement and the Interim Rule expressed agreement with the FDIC's federal oversight role in mutual-to-stock
conversions of State Savings Banks, but several also suggested that deference be paid to states' rights on issues
outside the FDIC's areas of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the issuance of the proposed rule, the Board is attempting to strike the proper balance in this regard. In particular,
the proposed rule includes a provision stating that, in the event that a State Savings Bank proposing to convert determines
that compliance with any provision of the proposed rule would be inconsistent or in conflict with applicable state
law, the bank may file with the FDIC a written request for waiver of compliance with the provision. The request would
have to demonstrate that the requested waiver would not be detrimental to the safety and soundness of the bank, entail
a breach of fiduciary duty by the bank's management, or otherwise be detrimental or inequitable to the bank, its depositors,
any other insured depository institution(s), the federal deposit insurance funds or the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, recently the OTS revised its regulations on mutual-to-stock conversions of savings associations.
OTS' concerns about avoiding insider abuses in mutual-to-stock conversions of federal and state savings associations
are the same as the FDIC's concerns about insider abuses in conversions of State Savings Banks. Thus, as noted above,
to the extent necessary and appropriate, the proposed rule incorporates most of the same requirements recently adopted
by the OTS.

The proposed rule would: Require the submission of a full appraisal report, including a complete and detailed description
of the elements that make up an appraisal report, justification for the methodology employed and sufficient support
for the conclusions reached therein; require a depositor vote on all mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings
Banks and prohibit management's use of previously executed (or ``running'') proxies to satisfy depositor voting
requirements; for one year following the date of the conversion, among other things, require that any management
recognition plans or stock option plans be implemented only after shareholder approval is received, require that
stock options (if any) be granted at no lower than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant and
prohibit MRPs funded by conversion proceeds; require that the record date for determining depositors eligible to
receive rights to participate in the subscription offering of the conversion stock not be less than one year prior
to the date of adoption of the plan of conversions by the converting bank's board of trustees; require that the subscription
offering provide a preference to eligible depositors and others in the bank's ``local community'' (as defined in
the proposed rule) or within 100 miles of the bank's home office or branch(es); require that employee stock ownership
plans (ESOPs) not have a priority over subscription rights of ``eligible depositors'' (as defined in the proposed
rule); require the submission of a business plan, including, among other things, a detailed discussion of how management
intends to deploy the capital raised through the sale of stock in the conversion; and prohibit stock repurchases within
one year following the conversion.

2. Discussion of Each Proposed Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a discussion of each of the requirements in the proposed rule. Many of the requirements are engendered
by the Board's concerns about bank management's proper exercise of its fiduciary duties. As discussed in the preamble
to the Interim Rule, the duties and obligations of trustees and officers of mutual savings banks are identical to the
responsibilities the FDIC has historically enunciated and enforced concerning directors and officers of commercial
banks.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Trustees (as well as officers) of mutual savings institutions are held to the same standard of care and loyalty as directors
and officers of stock banks. Thus, the trustees must fulfill their duty of loyalty to the institution by administering
its affairs with the utmost candor, personal honesty and integrity. They are prohibited from advancing their own
personal or business interests or those of others at the expense of the bank. This general fiduciary duty has been frequently
interpreted to include an element of fairness and good faith which, in the context of mutual-to-stock conversions,
affords protection to the various stakeholders (particularly depositors) of mutual savings banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC, through the Interim Rule, also requires the trustees of mutual savings banks to adhere to the same standards
of loyalty and care that are required of directors and officers of stock institutions in order to prevent insider abuse.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Publicized insider abuse (and the lawsuits that such abuses may engender) may have a sufficiently significant impact
upon the reputation of a bank to affect its continued viability and, thus, its safety and soundness, resulting in a
regulatory violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, the requirements in the proposed rule are rooted in concerns about safety and soundness, breaches
of fiduciary duty and/or other violations of law.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Submission of a Full Appraisal Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would require State Savings Banks that propose to convert to stock ownership to submit to the FDIC,
along with the other required materials, a full appraisal report on the value of the converting bank and the pricing
of the conversion stock. Many of the states require that a converting mutual savings banks sell its capital stock at
a total price equal to its estimated 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 market value, based on an independent valuation. The purpose of this requirement is to assure that the converting
institution receives the full value for the conversion stock sold. As indicated above and in the Request For Comments,
the FDIC has identified what may be significant problems with the overall conversion process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in detail in the Request For Comments, many recent mutual-to-stock conversions have exhibited significant
increases in the immediate post-conversion trading market for the stock. The FDIC is concerned that such increases
have resulted from appraisal reports (submitted in connection with these recent conversions) that have set the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 market value significantly below the true value of the converting institution. If an appraisal is too low and the shares
of stock are underpriced, the institution receives less of an increase in capital than it should from the sale of conversion
stock; in addition, the deposit insurance fund is provided with less of a capital cushion than would have resulted
if the stock was based on a proper and adequate appraisal. Also, an underpriced appraisal could entice insiders to
undertake a conversion (in order to acquire shares below their fair value) that may not be in the best interests of the
institution. Sophisticated investors also are able to benefit, undeservedly, from the sale of underpriced conversion
stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the proposed rule would require that a full appraisal be provided to the FDIC in a proposed mutual-to-stock
conversion of a State Savings Bank. The appraisal report would have to be prepared by an independent appraiser and
include a complete and detailed description of the elements that make up the report, justification for the methodology
employed and sufficient support for the conclusions reached therein. This would include a full discussion of the
applicability of each peer group member and documented analytical evidence supporting any variance (above or below)
the converting institution may have from the peer group statistics. The FDIC would require a complete analysis of
the institution's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 earnings which should include the bank's full potential once it fully deploys the new capital pursuant to its business
plan. In reviewing appraisal reports the FDIC would continue to consider the appraisal standards and guidelines,
if any, of the applicable state and/or the appraisal guidelines issued by the OTS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC generally has been disappointed with the appraisal reports it has reviewed in connection with proposed conversions.
As noted above, many appraisals have set the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 market value of the converting institution significantly below the true value of the institution as derived from
its peer group. Reasons for this have included inappropriate peer-group selections, inconsistencies between the
analysis in the appraisal report and the business plan submitted with the conversion notice and continued unfounded
justification for new issue discounts in stock issuances that have been well oversubscribed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC has noted that appraisals lack specific detail on the inclusion of peer group members regarding particular
information on: the markets within which they operate; the adjustments made to normalize their earnings or design
comparable 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 earnings; and the price appreciations experienced by each member since its conversion. Converting institutions
are almost always considered inferior to the peer group_a fact which raises questions about the composition of the
peer group. Little or no analytical evidence is typically given in appraisals for the discounts suggested for the
converting institution compared to the peer members. In addition, every appraisal contains a new issue discount
without any analytical support for exactly how much that discount should be or why it is needed. Our analysis indicates
market activity where virtually every conversion has traded up over the last few years. Finally, when subscription
offerings are completed and oversubscriptions have occurred (in some case, quite substantially) appraisers have
not justified why the original appraisal should not be increased beyond the ``supermax'' but rather in virtually
every case confirm the original valuation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many appraisals that the FDIC has reviewed contain only cursory analysis of the expected future earnings of the institution.
The FDIC believes that buyers of conversion stocks need to analyze institutions with much more financial sophistication
than what appears in the appraisal and, therefore, appraisals should be augmented. Earnings rarely reflect a true
expected use of conversion proceeds and others are understated by investments in low-rate securities. Earnings
are rarely estimated in conjunction with the converting institution's future business plan_a fact that the FDIC
finds inconsistent and unacceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the pendency of this rulemaking and subsequent to the adoption of a final rule, the FDIC will continue to review
appraisal reports to ensure that converting institutions and the conversion stock are properly valued. The FDIC
will continue to object to proposed conversions supported by unacceptable appraisal reports.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Depositor Voting Requirement and Prohibition on the Use of Running Proxies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board believes that, in order for a board of trustees of a mutual savings bank to properly exercise its fiduciary
responsibilities to the bank and its depositors, the board should obtain a vote of depositors in favor of the proposed
conversion before the proposed conversion is completed. Most states, but not all, require a depositor vote for mutual-to-stock
conversions. The OTS also requires both federal and state savings associations to obtain a majority vote of association
members as one of the pre-conditions to converting. Some states, however, require only that the board of trustees
(or similar group) approve the plan of conversion and do not require a vote of members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed below, several of the comments on the Interim Rule voiced opposition to ``voting rights'' for depositors
in states that do not provide such rights. In preliminary response to those comments, and subject to others that the
FDIC hopes to receive on this issue, the Board thinks that it is necessary and appropriate for the FDIC to require a depositor
vote on proposed conversions. Such a requirement would not necessarily contradict state laws (that do not require
a depositor vote), but supplement the state law by requiring the member vote. The FDIC's concern is with the board of
trustees' proper exercise of its fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the bank and its depositors. Preliminarily,
the Board believes that the proper exercise of such duties requires that depositors, as stakeholders of the bank,
have the opportunity to approve or disapprove the proposed conversion. This requirement is, in part, rooted in the
foregoing concern that bank insiders often benefit personally from bank conversions. This almost inherent conflict
of interest (between self interest and the interests of the bank) may be mitigated by the existence of a depositor vote
on the proposed conversion. The proposed rule, therefore, would require a depositor vote in favor of the proposed
conversion of a State Savings Bank to stock form. Unless otherwise prescribed by the applicable state law, the required
vote would be a majority of the bank's depositors and other stakeholders of the bank who the bank's trustees reasonably
determine are entitled to vote on the conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the same vein, the Board believes that a proxy specifically designed for the proposed conversion should be used
to obtain a depositor vote on the conversion. In some states the management of converting banks and savings associations,
subject to certain conditions, may use so-called ``running proxies'' (proxies obtained when a depositor opened
his or her account with the institution) to vote in favor of the proposed conversion. The former OTS mutual-to-stock
conversion regulations also permitted the use of running proxies, under certain circumstances. Running proxies
are prohibited by the OTS Revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC believes, preliminarily, that given the material change in structure represented by the bank's conversion
to stock form, it is imperative that depositors be permitted to vote separately on the proposed conversion and that
the most effective manner to assure that depositors are fully informed of the proposed conversion and have an opportunity
to participate fully in the conversion would be to prohibit the use of running proxies in such transactions. This is
in keeping with the FDIC's concern that the management of a State Savings Bank fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities
by assuring that the depositors are in agreement with the proposed conversion. Thus, the proposed rule would prohibit
the use of running proxies in the mutual-to-stock conversion process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Restrictions on Management Stock Benefit and Recognition Plans (MRPs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS Revisions prohibit MRPs in conversions of federal and state savings associations. Currently, however, the
regulations and policies of some state banking and thrift regulators permit MRPs to purchase a certain percentage
of the stock sold in a mutual-to-stock conversion of a bank or savings association depending on the institution's
capital position. Under some of these regulations and guidelines, management also may be granted stock options up
to a certain percentage of the shares issued in the conversion. Based on a review of numerous proposed conversions,
the Board believes that some bank insiders may be sacrificing the interests of their institutions and depositors
in order to acquire significant amounts of conversion stock and other benefits more advantageously than depositors.
Also, in some instances, the issuance of conversion stock to an MRP decreases the opportunity for depositors to obtain
conversion stock. Moreover, the issuance of stock options at the conversion price, rather than at the aftermarket
trading price, which in recent years has been substantially higher than the conversion price, creates the impression
that insider enrichment may be the main reason for the conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These factors reflect negatively on management's fulfillment of its fiduciary obligations. In fact, it may be an
inherent conflict of interest for management to decide to convert the bank to stock form when, as part of the proposed
conversion, management will reap significant benefits. Independent business judgment is essential to the proper
carrying out of a manager's obligations. This judgment may be severely clouded when MRPs are provided as part of the
conversion transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed below, the FDIC received several comments on the Proposed Policy Statement and the Interim Rule about
management compensation in the conversion process. Many of these comments argued that the management of converting
institutions should benefit from the conversion because such insiders are responsible for the bank's success and
will undertake additional and perhaps more difficult challenges upon the bank's conversion to stock form. The Board
does not disagree with this general point of view. While the Board believes that management and trustees would have
increased responsibilities as a public company, preliminarily, the Board believes that, in most cases, market-based
management compensation should be determined by the stockholders after the conversion is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, the proposed rule would provide that no converted savings bank shall, for one year from the date of the
conversion, implement a stock option plan or management or employee stock benefit plan, other than a tax-qualified
employee stock ownership plan, unless: each of the plans was fully disclosed in the proxy solicitation and conversion
stock offering materials; all such plans are approved by a majority of the bank's stockholders, or in the case of a recently
formed holding company, its stockholders, prior to implementation and no sooner than the first annual meeting following
the conversion; in the case of a savings bank subsidiary of a mutual holding company, all such plans are approved by
a majority of stockholders other than its parent mutual holding company prior to implementation and no sooner than
the first annual meeting following the stock issuance; for stock option plans, stock options are granted at no lower
than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant; and for management or employee stock benefit
plans, no conversion stock is used to fund the plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed restrictions on MRPs do not include specific percentage limitations. Preliminarily, the FDIC believes
that the proposed restrictions would adequately safeguard against potential management self-interest in mutual-to-stock
conversions. Also, pursuant to the Interim Rule, the FDIC would continue to look to MRP percentage limitations in
the OTS regulations, as well as in the applicable state law and regulations, as a frame of reference for reviewing proposed
conversions of State Savings Banks. In addition, the FDIC believes that specific percentage limitations on MRPs
may be too rigid and not serve to stem management abuses in every situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board requests specific comments on whether MRP percentage limitations should be specified in the FDIC's regulations
and, if so, what those percentages should be.

D. Eligibility Record Date, Priority to Depositors Residing in the Bank's Local Community, Priority of Employee
Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS Revisions require, among other things, that the record date established by a converting institution to determine
which depositors will be afforded a priority in obtaining subscription rights in the conversion stock be set at no
less than a year prior to the board of director's approval of the conversion. The Board believes, preliminarily, that,
in order for a board of trustees of a State Savings Bank to carry out its fiduciary responsibilities to the bank and its
depositors, the board must assure an equitable and lawful conversion process. From numerous comments we have received
thus far and from our own review of proposed and completed conversions, it is apparent that so-called professional
depositors, who place funds in mutual banks and savings associations throughout the country in order to gain a purchase
priority if the institution converts to stock form, have reaped substantial profits on conversions of mutual institutions.
A proper exercise of fiduciary responsibilities toward the bank and its longer-term depositors dictates that professional
depositors not be allowed to experience windfall gains in conversions. Requiring that the eligibility record date
be no less than one year prior to the board's adoption of the plan of conversion would help assure that longer-term depositors
are more likely than professional depositors to benefit from the stock purchase priority. Thus, the proposed rule
would require that the eligibility record date be no less than one year prior to the date the board of trustees approves
the plan of conversion. The FDIC requests specific comment on whether the one-year period is sufficient and on whether
the date chosen should be based on the board of trustees' first consideration of whether the bank should be converted
to the stock form of ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a further effort to mitigate the exploitation of the mutual-to-stock conversion process by professional depositors,
the proposed rule would provide a stock purchase preference to eligible depositors in the bank's ``local community''
or within 100 miles of a home or branch office of the converting bank. The term ``local community'' would be defined
as all counties in which the converting bank has its home office or a branch office, each county's standard metropolitan
statistical area or the general metropolitan area of each of these counties and such other area(s) as provided for
in bank's plan of conversion. The Board believes that it is likely that the double requirement (for a stock purchase
priority) of having a depositor relationship with the bank for at least one year prior to the date of the board's adoption
of the plan of conversion and of having to reside in the bank's local community would decrease the participation of
professional depositors in conversions of State Savings Banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is mindful, however, that there may be depositors, particularly long-term depositors, of a State Savings
Banks who are not ``professional depositors,'' but happen to live outside the ``local community'' or the 100-mile
area designated by the proposed requirement. Thus, the FDIC requests specific comment on whether and how such depositors
can be included within the proposed stock purchase preference for ``local depositors.'' One possible alternative
would be to expand the definition of ``local depositor'' to include all depositors who have had a deposit relationship
with the bank for, say, three or five years prior to the board of trustees' adoption of the plan of conversion. The Board
is interested in comments on all aspects of the proposed priority requirement for local depositors, including views
on whether the requirement is necessary, sufficient and/or equitable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the same vein, the Board believes that ESOPs (tax-qualified or otherwise) should not be accorded higher purchase
priority rights than long-term depositors. The Board believes that general principles of fiduciary duty require
that the board of trustees of a State Savings Bank put the interest of long-term depositors ahead of the interests of
management and employees. Thus, the proposed rule would require that ESOPs not be accorded a higher subscription
right priority than ``eligible depositors.'' The term ``eligible depositors'' would be defined as a depositor holding
qualifying deposits at the bank as of a date designated in the bank's plan of conversion that is not less than one year
prior to the date of adoption of the plan of conversion by the converting bank's board of trustees. The FDIC requests
specific comment on whether the one-year period is sufficient and on whether the period chosen should be based on the
board of trustees' first consideration of whether to convert to stock ownership.

E. Submission of Business Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For safety and soundness purposes the FDIC must know the institution's business plan for post-conversion operation,
growth and investment of any newly injected capital. The reason is that institutions converting from mutual form
undertake a major restructuring that possibly could lead to significant changes in the nature or volume of business
conducted. Converted institutions become answerable to shareholders for the first time, and the shareholders are
concerned with obtaining a reasonable return on their investment. As discussed in the preamble to the Interim Rule,
in the past some institutions, in leveraging capital raised through a conversion and reaching for a return on equity,
have vigorously competed for loans and unduly liberalized underwriting standards. Such practices led to loan losses
that in many instances depleted more capital than was raised through conversion and, in some cases, failures and losses
to the Bank Insurance Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the proposed rule would require State Savings Banks that propose to undergo a mutual-to-stock
conversion to submit a business plan including, among other things, a detailed discussion of how management intends
to deploy the capital raised through the sale of stock in the conversion, expected returns resulting from the plan,
and the justification for any intended stock repurchases.

F. Post-conversion Stock Repurchases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated above, the proposed rule would require that the business plan submitted to the FDIC in connection with
a proposed mutual-to-stock conversion include a detailed discussion of how the capital acquired in the conversion
will be utilized, including, among other things, a justification for any proposed stock repurchases. The FDIC is
concerned that substantial buyback programs begun immediately after the bank's conversion to stock form may not
have a legitimate business purpose. Such repurchases also raise issues about whether the conversion stock was appropriately
valued. In addition, the FDIC is concerned that a recently converted institution have a capital base adequate to safeguard
against possible unexpected losses that may occur under the new organizational structure. To protect against these
potential problems, the proposed rule would prohibit stock repurchases for one year following the conversion. Stock
repurchases after that period would be considered on a case-by-case basis under section 18(i)(1) of the FDI Act (12
U.S.C. 1828(i)(1)) which prohibits state nonmember banks from reducing or retiring capital without the prior consent
of the FDIC.

VI. Merger/Conversions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some cases, mutual institutions convert to stock ownership in the course of a merger or acquisition transaction
with another depository institution or holding company. This is generally known as a merger/conversion. In merger/conversions
depositors of the converting institutions obtain the right to purchase stock in the acquiring institution and not
the converting savings bank. In exercising its fiduciary responsibilities the board of trustees of a State Savings
Bank must assure that value of the converting institution is fairly distributed. This means not only guarding the
interests of long-term depositors against insiders and professional depositors, but against acquiring institutions.
Based on the proposed conversions we have reviewed in the recent past and other merger conversions we have studied,
the Board has observed that, in virtually every merger conversion, the acquiring institution captures a large portion
of the value of the converting institution. It is also not uncommon in merger/conversions for the management of the
converting mutual institution to receive extremely generous compensation and benefit packages. The OTS Revisions
prohibit merger/conversions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the preamble to the OTS Revisions, there is an issue whether the management of a mutual institution
is opting for a merger/conversion, instead of a standard conversion, based on the best interests of the institution
and its depositors or in response to the level of benefits offered to management by the acquiring entity. As noted in
the preamble to the Interim Rule, there have been numerous complaints recently by depositors and others that permitting
healthy mutual savings banks to be acquired by means of a merger/conversion has resulted in some savings bank insiders
putting their interest ahead of the interests of the converting bank and its depositors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the foregoing reasons, the Board believes that merger/conversions should, in most cases, be permitted only in
situations where a State Savings Bank is ``undercapitalized,'' ``significantly undercapitalized'' or ``critically
undercapitalized'' as defined in the FDIC's capital maintenance regulations. At this time, however, the Board does
not propose to impose a blanket prohibition on non-supervisory merger/conversions. The FDIC will continue to review
proposed merger/conversions with an emphasis on whether the fair value of the State Savings Bank would be delivered
to the rightful recipients. The FDIC is requesting specific comment on this topic and specifically whether a moratorium
should be placed on merger/conversions involving sufficiently capitalized State Savings Banks.

VII. Comparison With OTS Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the requirements imposed by the proposed rule would essentially parallel the OTS Revisions. There
are numerous other provisions in the OTS' mutual-to-stock conversion regulations (12 CFR part 563b), however, that
are not included in either the FDIC Interim Rule or the proposed rule. Those OTS regulations impose upon converting
savings associations specific and detailed requirements on, among other things: items to be included in the plan
of conversion, stock purchase priorities, percentage limitations on stock purchases and MRPs, proxy solicitation
and the form and content of proxy statements, the form and content of offering circulars, accounting rules, liquidation
accounts, notices of filing, availability of conversion documents and pricing and sale of securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminarily, the FDIC believes that the requirements imposed by the proposed rule, coupled with the requirements
of the Interim Rule, would enable the FDIC to monitor the conversions of State Savings Banks for issues involving safety
and soundness, fiduciary duty and other violations of law. Pursuant to the Interim Rule, the FDIC uses the OTS regulations
as a frame of reference in reviewing proposed mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks. The FDIC also looks
to the applicable state law and regulations in reviewing proposed conversions. To date, the FDIC has not identified
a need to adopt a more comprehensive set of regulations addressing all aspects of the mutual-to-stock conversion
process. It has been suggested, however, that in order to achieve greater uniformity with the OTS' conversion regulations
the FDIC's conversion regulations should be expanded to match the scope and depth of the OTS rules. Thus, the Board
specifically requests comment on whether the FDIC's regulations should be expanded to include provisions similar
to those of the OTS regulations that are not already included in either the Interim Rule or the proposed rule.

VIII. Convenience and Needs Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS has issued a proposed rule that would add a requirement to its mutual-to-stock conversion regulations that,
in determining whether to approve such a conversion transaction, the OTS would consider the convenience and needs
of the community served by the converting institution. 59 FR 22764 (May 3, 1994.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``convenience and needs of the community to be served'' by the applicant is one of the statutory factors required
to be considered by the Board in acting on applications for deposit insurance (12 U.S.C. 1816). Thus, in connection
with the review of mutual holding company reorganizations of insured depository institutions the FDIC already is
required to (and does) apply a convenience and needs test. The Board requests comment on whether the FDIC could and
should also consider imposing such a requirement in connection with the mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings
Banks.

IX. Summary of Comments on the Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC received 85 written comments on the Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Final Rule: 60 from banks, savings
banks, cooperative bank and saving associations; 7 from bank and thrift industry trade groups; 6 from state banking
and thrift regulators; 5 from individuals; 5 from law firms; 1 from a bank holding company; and 1 from a regulatory ``shadow''
group.

1. FDIC Oversight Role 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments did not focus on describing recent abuses in mutual-to-stock conversions. They generally acknowledged
that there had been notable examples of insider abuse in the recent past and then suggested how future potential abuses
could be avoided. Many of those who commented recommended that the FDIC play an oversight role in the mutual-to-stock
conversions of State Savings Banks. One state stock savings bank that is owned by a mutual holding company noted that
``present abuses in several recent and proposed conversions have demonstrated the need for the FDIC to maintain oversight
of the conversion process, to ensure that issues of both safety and soundness and of fiduciary care are identified
and adequately addressed.'' One state savings association trade group commented that ``with recent publicity over
some apparent abuses in the [conversion] process and resulting Congressional concerns, *&blank;*&blank;* it is
most appropriate and important for the FDIC to assert regulatory jurisdiction over conversions by state nonmember
banks.'' One state thrift regulator noted that the FDIC had issued an ``excellent set of rules'' with a ``very conservative,
realistic approach to a situation which could have gotten out of hand if left to go unchecked.'' One State Savings Bank
said simply that ``past abuses [in mutual-to-stock conversions] support the need for FDIC oversight.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggested that the FDIC have oversight authority of State Savings Bank mutual-to-stock conversions,
but with prescribed limitations. For example, a national banking industry trade group noted that it ``deplores instances
in which it can be demonstrated that insiders involved in mutual-to-stock conversions received benefits so large
that they bear no reasonable relationship to the institution's performance *&blank;*&blank;* Unjustifiable windfall
profits, depletion of capital without concern for safety and soundness and manipulation of the value of the institution
to benefit limited interests are practices that deserve close scrutiny and action by the appropriate authorities
*&blank;*&blank;* In responding to these issues, the FDIC should act quickly and decisively in concert with the state
authorities.'' The trade group further commented that the ``cornerstone'' for the FDIC's response to issues arising
from the mutual-to-stock conversion issue is the state regulatory authorities. One state thrift regulator expressed
support for FDIC oversight of conversions if such involvement assures ``reasonableness and relative uniformity
of benefits for both state- and OTS-regulated institutions *&blank;*&blank;* and allows state variation from OTS
requirements if such variations benefit the institution and the depositors.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One mutual savings bank noted that the FDIC should focus on broad safety-and-soundness issues and that detailed regulations,
like the OTS', are not necessary. Another state mutual savings bank said that the FDIC should be involved in conversion
oversight, but only in terms of setting minimum standards rather than superseding state regulation. Many savings
banks in Massachusetts and a banking trade association in that state commented that the FDIC should issue conversion
regulations similar to the OTS and Massachusetts mutual-to-stock conversion regulations, noting that the FDIC
has broad statutory authority to regulate issues that affect safety and soundness. They noted that the FDIC's focus
should be to eliminate abuses in stock evaluation, depositor disclosures, depositors' ability to purchase stock
at conversion and insider compensation programs. They also asserted that state statutory and regulatory conversion
rules should not be superseded by federal law. One mutual savings bank noted that promulgating federal laws or regulations
``should not be allowed when it is determined that state requirements are generally consistent or more stringent
than existing federal rules.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters contended that state regulation was sufficient in the area of mutual-to-stock conversions and that
the Interim Rule is not necessary. One mutual savings bank asserted that the ``averments made by the FDIC in support
of the Interim Rule that it is needed for safety and soundness reasons and to protect the interest of depositors are
without merit and are being offered only to support continued federal intrusion into issues which are primarily the
concern of state law and regulation.'' One state mutual savings bank stated that the ``proposed policy statement
is overkill'' and that ``state regulation can handle insider abuse issues.'' One state banking and thrift regulator
asserted that state regulators are not to blame for insider abuses in conversions and that ``states' rights should
not be tramped on.'' The regulator suggested that a committee of state and federal regulators work together to address
issues and concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All those who commented on the issue expressed objection to Congressional legislation to address current issues
in mutual-to-stock conversions. One mutual savings bank commented that ``if the FDIC does not act, Congress will_in
an uninformed manner.'' Another mutual savings bank noted that ``regulation is far preferable than legislation.''
A national banking industry trade group noted that the ``FDIC has full statutory authority in the conversion area
to ensure the integrity of the conversion process and no new legislation is necessary to address these issues.''

2. Transferable Subscription Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC received many comments on the issue whether conversion rules should be modified to require converting institutions
to provide depositors with transferable subscription rights to purchase the stock issued in the mutual-to-stock
conversion. This issue was not addressed in either the Proposed Policy Statement or the Interim Rule. In recent Congressional
testimony the FDIC Chairman has indicated that the FDIC may consider whether depositors and other stakeholders of
converting institutions should receive transferable subscription rights so they can participate more equitably
in the conversion process and receive benefits from the conversion without having to purchase conversion stock to
do so. With one exception, all the comments received on this issue opposed the idea. One mutual savings bank stated
that ``we are outraged that any governmental body would consider provisions such as depositor subscription rights
that could enable speculators to force a mutual bank to convert to a stock bank. Such a provision would not just endanger
this bank, but destroy it, along with many other community institutions.'' A national banking industry trade group
echoed these sentiments, noting that ``permitting or requiring transferable subscription rights would undermine
the integrity of conversions by generating intense pressures to convert mutuals to stock form. All mutuals would
be put into play.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many mutual savings and cooperative banks in Massachusetts expressed their objection to ``mandatory depository
transferable/saleable subscription rights'' noting that ``they could subject our depositors to professional
flippers [out-of-area depositors who are just interested in short-term investment gains], attorneys and investment
firms who may bring pressure to force a mutual-to-stock conversion.'' A shadow regulatory group expressed the opposite
view, arguing that subscription rights should be transferable to provide an incentive for depositors to exercise
their subscription rights.

3. Contributions to the Community/FDIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of those who commented on the issue expressed opposition to requiring converting institutions to contribute
part of the conversion proceeds directly to their communities. Many noted such a requirement would impose a ``social
tax'' on converting institutions. A state savings bank stated that ``a capital giveaway wouldn't further the FDIC's
legitimate goal of preserving safety and soundness.'' Another state savings bank noted that such a ``social tax would
jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank and would negatively affect credit availability to local consumers
and small businesses. These are not public funds.'' One of the numerous savings banks in Massachusetts who commented
negatively on this issue asserted that ``a social tax would replace insider greed with a form of outsider greed.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters, however, suggested that the FDIC should share in conversion proceeds. A regulatory ``shadow''
group stated that the FDIC should receive at least 50 percent of [the transferable subscription] rights [issued in
a mutual-to-stock conversion], which it would sell in the market. The group argued that: ``the taxpayer, through
the FDIC, has the strongest claim on the existing surplus of converting mutual institutions. The taxpayer has taken
the risk of loss that is usually borne by the stockholder. The public, that had to pay for the loss of failed thrifts,
should reap some of the benefits that all usually go to the stockholder.'' A state bank commented that ``windfall appreciation
from stock conversions should accrue to the FDIC. The FDIC has provided protection for thrifts over the years and deserves
the benefit.''

4. Merger/Conversions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An individual who commented on the Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Rule stated that merger/conversions should
not be allowed because they ``only serve management's interests and not the depositors.'' He suggested that any merger
take place only after an initial ``free-standing'' standard conversion. A bank holding company commented that merger/conversions
are desirable because they increase competition in the industry and support safety and soundness. It noted that state
law is the ``proper authority'' to regulate management compensation issues in merger/conversions. A law firm commented
that the problems with merger/conversions could be ``reduced substantially if the OTS revised its policy to encourage
a discount in the acquirors' stock as offered to depositors of the acquired institution.'' A state banking and thrift
regulator suggested that the FDIC and OTS collaborate in a joint determination on whether merger/conversions will
be approved in the future and, if so, adopt specific requirements to provide parity among savings associations and
savings banks. A state banking and thrift industry trade group recommended that merger/conversions be permitted
only in the case of undercapitalized institutions or at the discretion of the regulators on a case-by-case basis.
A national banking and thrift industry trade group said it would not oppose a ``regulatory pause by the FDIC to evaluate
its rules governing merger/conversions.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that the FDIC should not provide ``voting rights'' to depositors in connection with conversions
of mutual savings banks in states that do not provide such voting rights. One state bank asserted that ``voting rights
should be left to state law. To impose some sort of depositor approval requirement in a state that does not have depositor
voting could lead to expanded ownership claims by depositors that could operate to the detriment of mutuals.'' One
state banking and thrift regulator (of a state that does not provide a depositor voting right) asserted that ``any
FDIC requirement of a depositor vote in a mutual-to-stock conversion *&blank;*&blank;* [would be] wholly unsupported
by any expressly preemptive federal statute.'' Many banks in Massachusetts commented that any depositor voting
right requirements imposed by the FDIC would put undue pressure on mutuals in that state to convert to stock ownership.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual noted that general proxies should be prohibited and that all conversions should be subject to a special
proxy, or proxies should be entirely eliminated in favor of a majority-rules scheme. A national banking and thrift
industry trade group noted that the use of general proxies is reasonable under the OTS' rules.

6. Management Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of the commenters discussed the issue of management benefits in conversions. Several of them stated that insiders
should share in the benefits of conversions because the insiders managed the institution in a safe-and-sound manner.
One state thrift regulator (and other commenters) suggested that MRPs be based on the size of the institution and not
on ``straight across-the-board percentages.'' One national banking and thrift industry trade group noted that
``avoiding the use of across-the-board percentages for MRPs and tailoring their availability more to the size of
the institution and their specific business plan objectives and needs would be a reasonable approach.'' One mutual
savings bank noted that MRPs, stock option plans and employee stock ownership plans ``all encourage more stock ownership
and cement an identity among outside shareholders and those who run and work for the company.'' It also noted that OTS
rules are workable in this regard and should be adopted by the FDIC. Another savings association commented that conversions
should not be permitted where there is excessive compensation for insiders, but ``without benefits to insiders there
will be no conversions.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual commented that the FDIC should not regulate director remuneration in conversions of healthy mutuals
because those conversions do not place the insurance fund at risk and shareholders' votes are dispositive under the
``corporate waste'' doctrine. A law firm, commenting on behalf of a state thrift industry trade group, also noted
that compensation benefits are not a safety-and-soundness concern if the institution meets the applicable capital
requirements. In addition, it stated that a ``uniformity of benefits between state- and OTS-regulated conversions''
is necessary to assure the end of ``regulatory arbitrage.'' A state bank and thrift regulator (and several other commenters)
suggested that the FDIC and OTS publish joint MRP guidelines permitting or prohibiting MRPs, along with specific
rules therefore. It noted that ``proper resolution of the MRP issue will have a substantial impact on fairness to depositors
in conversions.'' One savings bank commented that ``when an institution contemplates going public for the right
reasons (expansion, market share, competitive advantage) the benefits should go to those willing to risk their careers
(board and management team) or their capital (shareholders) not to the faceless non-entity group known as the existing
depositors.''

7. Appraisals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A state savings association noted that one of the basic problems with conversions is the appraisal of the institution.
It stated that ``the FDIC needs to be satisfied that the various states are as well equipped [as the ``qualified'' OTS
staff] to perform a definitive analysis of institution appraisals as well as know with certainty that the appraiser
is qualified to assess a financial institution's value.'' The commenter also noted that fairness and moderation
are the keys to governing stock conversions. An individual commented that the FDIC should not regulate the offer price
for healthy mutuals because those conversions do not place the insurance fund at risk. An individual suggested that
the applicable regulator should retain its own appraiser to assure fair valuation of the converting entity. A state
bank and thrift regulator stated that appraisal rules required by the FDIC should be specifically stated in the Interim
Rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An attorney commented that the Interim Rule should allow depositors full access to all papers filed in connection
with proposed merger/conversions, as well as standard conversions. He also suggested that depositors be permitted
to file with the FDIC objections to such proposed transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters noted that the FDIC should clarify that the Interim Rule applies to mutual holding company formations
and merger/conversions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual suggested that, to protect the insurance fund, a converting institution should prepare a business
plan regarding the proposed use of the new capital. The plan should be reviewed by the applicable state; however, if
the FDIC feels state review will be insufficient, the FDIC is empowered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act)
to assume jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two law firms suggested that the FDIC's review time on conversion notices be reduced from 60 days to 45 days because
of the potential that financial information might become ``stale'' under rules issued by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the converting institution would have to go through the expense of producing updated financial statements.

Scope.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This section applies to the conversion of insured mutual state savings banks to the stock form of ownership. It supplements
the procedural and other requirements for such conversions in &sect;303.15 of this chapter. This section also applies,
to the extent appropriate, to the reorganization of insured mutual state savings banks to the mutual holding company
form of ownership. As determined by the Board of Directors of the FDIC on a case-by-case basis, this section does not
apply to mutual-to-stock conversions of insured mutual state savings banks whose capital category under &sect;325.103
of this chapter is ``undercapitalized,'' ``significantly undercapitalized'' or ``critically undercapitalized.''
The Board of Directors of the FDIC may grant a waiver in writing from any requirement of this section for good cause shown.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conflicts with state law.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the event that an insured mutual state savings bank that proposes to convert to the stock form of ownership finds
that compliance with any provision of this section would be inconsistent or in conflict with applicable state law,
the bank may file a written request for waiver of compliance with such provision by the FDIC. In making such request,
the bank shall demonstrate that the requested waiver, if granted, would not result in any effects that would be detrimental
to the safety and soundness of the bank, entail a breach of fiduciary duty on part of the bank's management or otherwise
be detrimental or inequitable to the bank, its depositors, any other insured depository institution(s), the federal
deposit insurance funds or to the public interest.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 13, 1992, the West Virginia Department of Commerce, Labor &amp; Environmental Resources; Division of
Environmental Protection; Office of Air Quality (WVOAQ) submitted a request to EPA to redesignate the Charleston
moderate ozone nonattainment area (Kanawha and Putnam Counties) from nonattainment to attainment. On November
13, 1992, the WVOAQ also submitted a maintenance plan for the Charleston area as a revision to the West Virginia State
Implementation Plan (SIP). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 28, 1994, West Virginia submitted an update to its November 13, 1994 submittal. The EPA is proposing to
redesignate the Charleston ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment and proposing to approve
the maintenance plan submitted by the WVOAQ as a revision to the West Virginia SIP because the relevant requirements
set forth in the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, have been met. This proposal to approve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redesignation is contingent upon West Virginia's submittal of a revision to its maintenance plan's provisions for
implementation of contingency measures. These actions are being taken in accordance with the Act. The approved maintenance
plan will become a federally enforceable part of the SIP for the Charleston area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 Act), required areas that were designated nonattainment based on a failure
to meet the ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) to develop SIPs with sufficient control measures
to expeditiously attain and maintain the standard. (1977 Act, sections 110(a)(1) and 172.) The Charleston, West
Virginia nonattainment area was designated under section 107 of the 1977 Act as nonattainment with respect to the
ozone NAAQS on September 12, 1978. (40 CFR 81.347) In accordance with section 110 of the 1977 Act, West Virginia submitted
a part D ozone SIP on November 15, 1979 which EPA approved as meeting the requirements of section 110 and part D of the
1977 Act. In its SIP, the State of West Virginia projected that the Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment area would
attain the ozone standard by December 31, 1982. The area failed to attain the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (hereafter the Act) were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549,
104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. The nonattainment designation of the Charleston, West Virginia
area continued by operation of law according to section 107(d)(1)(C)(i) of the Act, furthermore, it was classified
by operation of law as moderate for ozone pursuant to section 181(a)(1) of the Act. See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991) and
57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.347. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Charleston, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area more recently has attained the ozone NAAQS, based on air quality
data from 1989 through 1991. In an effort to comply with the Act and to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS, on November
13, 1992 the WVOAQ submitted an ozone maintenance plan for the Charleston, West Virginia area as a revision to the West
Virginia SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 13, 1992, the State of West Virginia also requested that EPA redesignate the Charleston, West Virginia
area to attainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS. In addition, on February 28, 1994, West Virginia submitted an update
to its November 13, 1992 submittal, collectively referred to hereafter as the ``State of West Virginia's redesignation
request.''

III. Review of West Virginia's Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of West Virginia's redesignation request for the Charleston, West Virginia area included information
and documentation sufficient for EPA to determine that the five requirements of section 107, noted above have been
met. Following is a brief description of how each of these requirements has been fulfilled. Because the maintenance
plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under
its analysis of the redesignation request. A Technical Support Document (TSD) has also been prepared by EPA on these
rulemaking actions. That TSD is available for public inspection at the EPA Regional Office listed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

1. Attainment of the Ozone NAAQS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The submittal contains an analysis of ozone air quality data which is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation
request. Ambient ozone monitoring data for 1989 through 1991 show attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the Charleston,
West Virginia area. See 40 CFR &sect;50.9 and appendix H. The State of West Virginia's request for redesignation included
documentation that the Charleston, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area has complete, quality-assured data
showing attainment of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period. Therefore, the Charleston,
West Virginia area has met the first statutory criterion for redesignation to attainment of the ozone NAAQS found
at section 107(d)(3)(E)(i) of the Act. It is important to note that EPA has also reviewed the ozone data monitored during
the 1992 and 1993 ozone seasons in the Charleston area and determined that no violations of the standard were monitored
during those years. Therefore, there have been no violations of the ozone standard monitored in the Charleston area
since the 1988 ozone season.

2. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously stated, EPA fully approved the State of West Virginia SIP for the Charleston, West Virginia area as meeting
the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 Act. The amended Act, however, modified section 110(a)(2)
and, under Part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes
of redesignation, EPA has reviewed the SIP to ensure that it contains all measures that were due under the Act as of November
13, 1992, the date the State of West Virginia submitted its redesignation request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2.A. Section 110 Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 110 of the 1977 Act was amended in 1990, the Charleston, West Virginia SIP meets the requirements
of section 110(a)(2) of the amended Act. A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA
believes that the pre-amendment SIP met these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended, See 57 FR
27936 and 23939 (June 23, 1993), many are duplicative of other requirements of the Act. EPA has analyzed the SIP and
determined that it is consistent with the requirements of section 110(a)(2) of the Act. It contains enforceable emission
limitations, it requires monitoring, compiling, and analyzing ambient air quality data, it requires preconstruction
review of new major stationary sources and major modifications to existing ones, it provides for adequate funding,
staff, and associated resources necessary to implement its requirements, and requires stationary source emissions
monitoring and reporting.

2.B. Part D Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before the Charleston, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area may be redesignated to attainment, it also must have
fulfilled applicable requirements of part D due as of the date of the State's redesignation request. Under part D,
an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the
basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well as nonclassifiable.
Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section
181(a). The Charleston, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area was classified as moderate. (See 56 FR 56694, codified
at 40 CFR 81.347). Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, West Virginia must meet the applicable requirements
of subpart 1 of part D_specifically sections 172(c) and 176_as well as the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of
part D_due as of the date of the State's November 13, 1992 request for redesignation. EPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(v)
to mean that for a redesignation request to be approved, the State has met all requirements that applied to the subject
area prior to or at the time of the submission of a complete redesignation request. Requirements of the Act that come
due subsequently continue to be applicable to the area at those later dates (see section 175A(c)) and, if the redesignation
of the area is disapproved, the State remains obligated to fulfill those requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2.B.1. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172(c) Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable no later than 3 years after an area has been designated
as nonattainment under the Act. EPA has determined that these requirements were not applicable to ozone nonattainment
areas on or before November 13, 1992_the date the State of West Virginia submitted a complete redesignation request
and maintenance plan for Charleston. Therefore, the State of West Virginia is not required to meet these requirements
for purposes of redesignation. West Virginia has, however, completed and submitted a 1990 base year emissions inventory
for its ozone nonattainment areas (including the Charleston area) in accordance with EPA's guidance. It is also important
to note that upon redesignation to attainment, the preconstruction new source review requirements for prevention
of significant deterioration (PSD) would apply in the Charleston area. EPA approved West Virginia's PSD SIP program
on April 11, 1986 (51 FR 12517).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2.B.2. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 176 Conformity Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 176(c) of the Act requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that
Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable State SIP. The
requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded
or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other
Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted
by States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the Act required EPA to promulgate. Congress
provided for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations.
When that date passed without such promulgation, USEPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I informed
States that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general conformity
regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that States adopt both transportation
and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan
approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to &sect;51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and &sect;51.851
of the general conformity rule, the State of West Virginia is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation
conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly,
West Virginia is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent
with those established in the Federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not
yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval
of this redesignation request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2.B.3. Subpart 2 of Part D_Section 182 Provisions for Ozone Nonattainment Areas
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment area is classified as moderate and is subject to the requirements of
section 182(b) of the Act. As of November 13, 1992, the date West Virginia submitted a complete redesignation request
for the Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment area, the Charleston, West Virginia area was required to meet the
provisions of section 182(a)(2)(A) to correct its Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements
in effect prior to enactment of the 1990 amendments to the Act. The State of West Virginia submitted those RACT corrections
as SIP revisions to EPA on June 4, 1991. A final rule approving these RACT corrections was published on September 17,
1992 (57 FR 42895).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 15, 1993, EPA notified the Governor of West Virginia that it had made a finding that West Virginia had failed
to submit either a full or committal SIP revision for a basic inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for its ozone
nonattainment areas. On January 18, 1994, EPA notified the Governor of West Virginia that it had made a finding that
West Virginia had failed to submit a 15% rate of progress plan SIP revision for its ozone nonattainment areas. Upon
the effective date of a final approval by EPA of West Virginia's redesignation request, these findings will be automatically
rescinded in the Charleston nonattainment area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated previously, EPA has approved the RACT corrections noted above. Therefore, the State of West Virginia has
a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and part D as
discussed above. Therefore, the redesignation requirement of section 107(d)(3)(E)(ii) has been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Improvement in Air Quality Due to Permanent and Enforceable Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the 1977 Act, EPA approved the State of West Virginia SIP control strategy for the Charleston, West Virginia
nonattainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area. EPA determined that the rules and the emission reductions achieved as a result of those rules were enforceable.
Since enactment of the 1990 amendments, the State of West Virginia submitted corrections to its RACT regulations
as identified above. EPA finds that these additional measures contribute to the permanence and enforceability of
reductions in ambient ozone levels in the Charleston, West Virginia area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Between 1988 and 1990, because of permanent and enforceable state and federal provisions, emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) were reduced by 8.14 tons/day and emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) were reduced by 3.1 tons/day in Charleston. Most of the reductions came from mobile sources and gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketing-related activities. The Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), of gasoline marketed for use in the Charleston, West
Virginia area decreased from 10.5 RVP to 9.5 RVP in 1990 and was reduced to 9.0 in 1992. In addition, due to automobile
fleet turnover, there was an increase in the percent of automobiles operated in the Charleston area meeting more stringent
emission standards as required by the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP). It must be noted here that since
1992 the federal RVP requirement of 9.0 has been the applicable standard in the Charleston, West Virginia area.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of West Virginia maintenance plan requires the continuation of the federal RVP program. These reductions
due to lower RVP and more stringent tailpipe standards resulting from the FMVCP were determined using the mobile emission
inventory model MOBILE 5.0a and the relevant vehicle miles traveled data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permanent and enforceable decreases in VOCs at stationary sources contributed a small amount to the total VOC reduction
in the Charleston, West Virginia area. In association with its emission inventory, the State of West Virginia demonstrated
that point source VOC emissions were not artificially low due to local economic downturn during the period in which
the Charleston, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
West Virginia area's ambient air quality came into attainment. Reductions due to decreases in production levels
or from other unenforceable scenarios such as voluntary reductions were not included in the determination of the
emission reductions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA finds that the combination of measures contained in the SIP and federal measures have resulted in permanent and
enforceable reductions in ozone precursors that have allowed the Charleston West Virginia area to attain the NAAQS,
and therefore, that the redesignation criterion of section 107(d)(3)(E)(iii) has been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Fully Approved Maintenance Plan Under Section 175A
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing approval of the State of West Virginia maintenance plan for the Charleston, West Virginia area because
EPA finds that West Virginia's submittal meets the requirements of section 175A of the Act. If EPA determines after
notice and comment that it should give final approval to the maintenance plan, the Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment
area will have a fully approved maintenance plan in accordance with section 175A of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 175A of the Act sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment
to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least ten years after
the area is redesignated. Eight years after the redesignation, the state must submit a revised maintenance plan which
demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures,
with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5.A. Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 13, 1992, the State of West Virginia submitted comprehensive inventories of VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from area, stationary, and mobile using 1990 as the base year for calculations to demonstrate maintenance.
The 1990 VOC inventory is considered most representative of attainment conditions because no violations occurred
in 1990 and it reflects the typical inventory for the three-year period demonstrating attainment of the standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of West Virginia submittal contains detailed inventory data and summaries by source categories. The State
of West Virginia submittal also contains information related to how it comported with EPA's guidance, which model
and emission factors were used (note MOBILE 5.0a was used), how Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) data was generated,
what RVP was considered in the base year, and other technical information verifying the validity of the Charleston
West Virginia emission inventory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of West Virginia's submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by source category. This
inventory was prepared in accordance with EPA guidances. A summary of the base year and projected maintenance year
inventories are shown in the following six tables. The TSD which has been prepared for this action contains more in-depth
details regarding the base year for the Charleston area.

5.B. Demonstration of Maintenance_Projected Inventories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the continued use of lower RVP gasoline (9.0) and fleet turnover to automobiles meeting more stringent
emission standards, mobile source emission projections are dependent upon the implementation of the federal reformulated
gasoline program. Total VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions were projected from the 1990 base year out to year 2005. These projected inventories were prepared in accordance
with EPA guidance. The projections demonstrate that the ozone standard will be maintained i.e., emissions are not
expected to exceed the level of the base year inventory during this time period. EPA believes that the emissions projections
demonstrate that the area will continue to maintain the ozone NAAQS because this area achieved attainment through
VOC controls and reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5C. Verification of Continued Attainment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Continued attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the Charleston, West Virginia area depends, in part, on the State of West
Virginia efforts toward tracking indicators of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The State of
West Virginia will track the status and effectiveness of the maintenance plan by periodically updating the emissions
inventory every three years. The WVOAQ has committed to perform this tracking on an annual basis in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable the State of West Virginia to implement the contingency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures of its maintenance plan as expeditiously as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of West Virginia annual update will indicate new source growth, as indicated by annual emission statements.
The State of West Virginia will continue to monitor ambient ozone levels by operating its ambient ozone air quality
monitoring network in accordance with 40 CFR part 58. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5D. Contingency Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The level of VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions in the Charleston area will largely determine its ability to stay in compliance with the ozone NAAQS in the
future. Despite the State of West Virginia's best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS, the
Charleston area may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Therefore, West Virginia has provided contingency measures with
a schedule for implementation in the event of future ozone air quality problems. In the event that exceedances of the
ozone NAAQS are measured such that nonattainment is indicated in any of the areas or in the event that periodic emission
inventory updates or major permitting activity reveals that excessive or unanticipated growth in ozone precursor
emissions has occurred or will occur, the West Virginia will accordingly select and adopt measures including the
following to assure continued attainment:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Extend the applicability of 45CSR21 (VOC/RACT rule) to include source categories previously excluded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Revised new source permitting requirements requiring more stringent emissions control technology and/or emissions
offsets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. NO

 RACT requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Stage II Vapor Recovery Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Regulations to establish plant-wide emission caps (potentially with emissions trading provisions). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Implementation of basic (or enhanced) programs for motor vehicle inspection and maintenance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One or more of these regulatory revisions would be selected within three (3) months after verification of a monitored
ozone standard violation and a draft rule submitted to the WVOAQ. Quality assurance procedures must confirm the monitored
violation within 45 days of occurrence. The WVOAQ will be requested to adopt the control measure(s) as emergency rule(s)
which will be implemented within six (6) months after adoption. EPA's approval of West Virginia's redesignation
request is contingent upon West Virginia promulgating a revision to its contingency plan that includes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule for the mandatory implementation of the selected contingency measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

5E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 175A(b) of the Act, the State of West Virginia has agreed to submit a revised maintenance
SIP eight years after the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an
additional ten years. EPA has determined that the maintenance plan adopted by the State of West Virginia and submitted
to EPA on November 13, 1992, meets the requirements of section 175A of the CAA. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve
the maintenance plan submittal. In addition EPA has determined that upon final approval of the maintenance plan the
provisions of section 107(d)(3)(E)(iv) for redesignation will have been met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposes to approve the ozone maintenance plan for the Charleston, West Virginia area submitted by the State of
West Virginia on November 13, 1992 as a revision to the West Virginia SIP because it meets the requirements of section
175A. In addition, EPA is proposing to redesignate the Charleston, West Virginia nonattainment area to attainment,
subject to final approval of the maintenance plan, because the Agency has determined that the provisions of section
107(d)(3)(E) of the Act for redesignation of nonattainment areas to attainment have been met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is soliciting public comments on this notice and on issues relevant to EPA's proposed action. Comments will be
considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the federal rulemaking procedure
by submitting written comments to the person and address listed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section at the beginning of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Ozone State
Implementation Plans (SIPs) are designed to satisfy the requirements of part D of the Clean Air Act and to provide for
attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. Today's proposed redesignation action should not be interpreted
as authorizing the State of West Virginia to delete, alter, or rescind any of the VOC emission limitations and restrictions
contained in the currently approved ozone SIP. Changes to the ozone SIP's regulations rendering them less stringent
than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those contained in the EPA approved plan cannot be made unless a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised plan for attainment and maintenance is submitted to and approved by EPA. Unauthorized relaxations, deletions,
and changes could result in both a finding of nonimplementation under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
173(b) of the Act and in a SIP deficiency call made pursuant to section 110(k)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter
I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing.
Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, it does not have any economic impact
on any small entities. Redesignation of an area to attainment under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act does not impose
any new requirements on small entities. Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area
and does not impose any regulatory requirements on sources. Accordingly, I certify that EPA's approval of West Virginia's
request to redesignate the Charleston ozone nonattainment area to attainment and the associated maintenance plan
will not have an impact on any small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing this rule under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA), Subtitle I_Regulation of Underground Storage Tanks, 42 U.S.C. 6901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
., to limit the regulatory obligations of persons maintaining indicia of ownership in a petroleum underground storage
tank (UST) or UST system primarily to protect a security interest. The rule is proposed in response to petitions received
by the Agency in connection with the rulemaking related to lender liability under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (See 57 FR 18349). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing conditions under which certain security interest holders may be exempted from the RCRA Subtitle
I corrective action, technical, and financial responsibility regulatory requirements that apply to an UST owner
and operator. (See 40 CFR part 280.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to establish regulatory criteria specifying which RCRA Subtitle I requirements are applicable
to a secured creditor. Section 9003(h)(9) of RCRA exempts from the definition of ``owner,'' for purposes of section
9003(h)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
_EPA Response Program for Petroleum,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 those persons who, without participating in the management of the UST or UST system, and who are not otherwise engaged
in petroleum production, refining, and marketing, maintain indicia of ownership in an UST or UST system primarily
to protect a security interest. Those most affected by this ``security interest exemption'' include private lending
institutions or other persons that guarantee loans secured by real estate containing an UST or UST system, or that
acquire title to, or other indicia of ownership in, a contaminated UST or UST system.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 However, the security interest exemption is not limited solely to lending institutions; it potentially applies
to any person whose indicia of ownership in an UST or UST system is maintained primarily to protect a security interest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The RCRA subtitle I security interest exemption not only affects secured creditors but also UST and UST system owners
who seek capital through the private lending market. Today's proposed rule will provide a regulatory exemption from
corrective action regulatory requirements for those persons who provide secured financing to UST and UST system
owners. EPA expects this rule, in conjunction with the statutory exemption in section section 9003(h)(9), to encourage
the extension of credit to credit-worthy UST owners. At present, EPA believes that concerns over environmental liability
are making a significant number of lenders reluctant to make loans to otherwise credit-worthy owners and operators
of USTs. The free flow of credit to UST owners (many of whom are small entities that may rely on secured financing mechanisms
for capital) is expected to assist UST owners in meeting their obligations to upgrade, maintain, or otherwise comply
with RCRA subtitle I and other environmental requirements. Conversely, the lack of such capital may adversely affect
the ability of an UST owner to meet its obligations under Subtitle I, with concomitant adverse environmental impacts
from USTs and UST systems that are out of compliance due to the lack of financing for the UST owner and operator. (For
a more detailed discussion, please refer to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory Background Document
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for this proposed rule, located in the OUST Docket at 401 M Street, SW., room 2616, Washington, DC 20460.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is also concerned that if otherwise credit-worthy UST owners and operators are unable to obtain financing
to perform leak detection tests, or to upgrade or replace deficient tanks, the market for UST equipment could be adversely
affected, thereby limiting the availability and/or affecting the cost of such equipment. In addition, a lack of adequate
capital could produce a ripple effect which would cut across other portions of the UST-related industrial sector.
Based on letters received from UST equipment manufacturers, EPA believes that this sector has suffered as a direct
result of the capital squeeze on UST owners and operators. The Agency is further concerned that many UST equipment
manufacturers may find it increasingly difficult to sustain their production of UST equipment. Unnecessary constrictions
on the free flow of capital for UST compliance and improvements could force companies to abandon their production
of UST equipment or to close altogether, and it may have adverse impacts on the environment by making the investment
or development of new UST technological innovations more difficult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble to this proposed rule is structured as follows: The following section briefly describes the UST program.
This section is followed by a discussion of this proposed rule, which includes a description of the various options
lenders may exercise both pre- and post-foreclosure with respect to regulatory compliance for a secured UST or UST
system. Proposed regulatory text concludes this proposed rule.

II. Description of the UST Regulatory Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the Agency's study of the banking community's lending practices and discussions with representatives of
both lenders and borrowers, EPA believes that the lending community in general is not particularly familiar with
the UST statutory scheme and regulatory program. Because UST and UST systems are likely to be used as collateral in
securing loans to borrowers, the Agency believes that it is appropriate and useful to briefly describe the UST program
in the preamble of this proposed rule. The following discussion is general in nature and is intended to provide a framework
for lenders or others to better understand the scope and intent of the program; it is not intended to be a substitute
for the regulations themselves.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, Congress responded to the increasing threat to groundwater
posed by leaking underground storage tanks by adding subtitle I to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Subtitle
I required EPA to develop a comprehensive regulatory program for USTs storing petroleum or hazardous substances.
Congress directed the Agency to publish regulations that would require owners and operators of new tanks and tanks
already in the ground to prevent and detect leaks, cleanup leaks, and demonstrate that they are financially capable
of cleaning up leaks and compensating third parties for resulting damages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's UST regulations, 40 CFR parts 280 and 281, apply to any person who owns or operates an UST or UST system. The term
``owner'' is defined in the statute generally to mean any person who owns an UST used for the storage, use, or dispensing
of substances regulated under subtitle I of RCRA (which includes both petroleum and hazardous substances) (section
9001(3), 42 U.S.C. 6991(3)). Owners are responsible for complying with the ``technical requirements,'' ``financial
responsibility requirements,'' and ``corrective action requirements'' specified in the statute and regulations.
These requirements are intended to ensure that USTs are managed and maintained safely, so that they will not leak or
otherwise cause harm to human health and the environment. In addition, should a leak occur, the requirements provide
that the owner is responsible for addressing the problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These same requirements apply to any person who ``operates'' an UST system. The term ``operator'' is very broad and
means ``any person in control of, or having responsibility for, the daily operation of the underground storage tank''
(section 9001(4), 42 U.S.C. 6991(4)). As with owners, there may be more than one operator of a tank at a given time. Each
owner and operator has obligations under the statute and regulations. In this respect, it is important to understand
that a person may have obligations under subtitle I either as an owner or as an operator, or both.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The technical standards of 40 CFR part 280 referred to here include: Subpart B_UST systems: Design, Construction,
Installation, and Notification (including performance standards for new UST systems, upgrading of existing UST
systems, and notification requirements); Subpart C_General Operating Requirements (including spill and overfill
control, corrosion protection, reporting and recordkeeping); Subpart D_Release Detection; &sect;280.50 (reporting
of suspected releases) of Subpart E_Release Reporting, Investigation, and Confirmation; and Subpart G_Out of Service
UST Systems (including temporary and permanent closure). These regulations impose obligations upon UST owners
and operators, separate from the subtitle I corrective action requirements discussed in Section II. B of this preamble.

1. Leak Prevention
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before EPA regulations were issued, most tanks were constructed of bare steel and were not equipped with release prevention
or detection features. 40 CFR 280.21 requires UST owners and operators to ensure that their tanks are protected against
corrosion and equipped with devices that prevent spills and overfills no later than December 22, 1998. Tanks installed
before December 22, 1988 must be replaced or upgraded by fitting them with corrosion protection and spill and overfill
prevention devices to bring them up to new-tank standards. USTs installed after December 22, 1988 must be fiberglass-reinforced
plastic, corrosion-protected steel, a composite of these materials, or determined by the implementing agency to
be no less protective of human health and the environment and must be designed, constructed, and installed in accordance
with a code of practice developed by a nationally recognized association or independent testing laboratory. Piping
installed after December 22, 1988 generally must be protected against corrosion in accordance with a national code
of practice. All owners and operators must also ensure that releases due to spilling or overfilling do not occur during
product transfer and that all steel systems with corrosion protection are maintained, inspected, and tested in accordance
with &sect;280.31.

2. Leak Detection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to meeting the leak prevention requirements, owners and operators of USTs must use a method listed in &sect;&sect;280.43
through 280.44 for detecting leaks from portions of both tanks and piping that routinely contain product. Deadlines
for compliance with the leak detection requirements have been phased in based on the tank's age: The oldest tanks,
which are most likely to leak, had the earliest compliance deadlines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Release Reporting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
UST owners and operators must, in accordance with &sect;280.50, report to the implementing agency within 24 hours,
or another reasonable time period specified by the implementing agency, the discovery of any released regulated
UST substances, or any suspected release. Unusual operating conditions or monitoring results indicating a release
must also be reported to the implementing agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Closure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Owners or operators who would like to take tanks out of operation must either temporarily or permanently close them
in accordance with 40 CFR part 280, subpart G_Out-of-Service UST Systems and Closure. When UST systems are temporarily
closed, owners and operators must continue operation and maintenance of corrosion protection and, unless all USTs
have been emptied, release detection. If temporarily closed for three months or more, the UST system's vent lines
must be left open and functioning, and all other lines, pumps, manways, and ancillary equipment must be capped and
secured. After 12 months, tanks that do not meet either the performance standards for new UST systems or the upgrading
requirements (excluding spill and overfill device requirements) must be permanently closed, unless a site assessment
is performed by the owner or operator and an extension is obtained from the implementing agency. To close a tank permanently,
an owner or operator generally must: Notify the regulatory authority 30 days before closing (or another reasonable
time period determined by the implementing agency); determine if the tank has leaked and, if so, take appropriate
notification and corrective action; empty and clean the UST; and either remove the UST from the ground or leave it in
the ground filled with an inert, solid material.

5. Notification, Reporting, and Recordkeeping
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
UST owners who bring an UST system into use after May 8, 1986 must notify state or local authorities of the existence
of the UST and certify compliance with certain technical and other requirements, as specified in &sect;280.22. Owners
and operators must also notify the implementing agency at least 30 days (or another reasonable time period determined
by the implementing agency) prior to the permanent closure of an UST. In addition, owners and operators must keep records
of testing results for the cathodic protection system, if one is used; leak detection performance and upkeep; repairs;
and site assessment results at permanent closure (which must be kept for at least three years).

B. Corrective Action Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Owners and operators of UST systems containing petroleum or hazardous substances must investigate, confirm, and
respond to confirmed releases, as specified in &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.67. These requirements include,
where appropriate: Performing a release investigation when a release is suspected or to determine if the UST system
is the source of an off-site impact (investigation and confirmation steps include conducting tests to determine
if a leak exists in the UST or UST system and conducting a site check if tests indicate that a leak does not exist but contamination
is present); notifying the appropriate agencies of the release within a specified period of time; taking immediate
action to prevent any further release (such as removing product from the UST system); containing and immediately
cleaning up spills or overfills; monitoring and preventing the spread of contamination into the soil and/or groundwater;
assembling detailed information about the site and the nature of the release; removing free product to the maximum
extent practicable; investigating soil and groundwater contamination; and, in some cases, outlining and implementing
a detailed corrective action plan for remediation.

C. Financial Responsibility Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The financial responsibility regulations (40 CFR part 280, subpart H) require that UST owners or operators demonstrate
the ability to pay the costs of corrective action and to compensate third parties for injuries or damages resulting
from the release of petroleum from USTs. The regulations require all owners or operators of petroleum USTs to maintain
an annual aggregate of financial assurance of $1 million or $2 million, depending on the number of USTs owned. Financial
assurance options available to owners and operators include: Purchasing commercial environmental impairment
liability insurance; demonstrating self-insurance; obtaining guarantees, surety bonds, or letters of credit;
placing the required amount into a trust fund administered by a third party; or relying on coverage provided by a state
assurance fund.

D. State Program Approval Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subtitle I of RCRA allows state UST programs approved by EPA to operate in lieu of the federal program. EPA's state program
approval regulations under 40 CFR part 281 set standards for state programs to meet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Scope of the UST Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are certain types or classes of tanks that are exempt from all or part of subtitle I's requirements. Specifically
excluded by statute are: Farm and residential tanks of 1,100 gallons or less capacity used for storing motor fuel for
noncommercial purposes; tanks used for storing heating oil for consumptive use on the premises where stored; tanks
stored on or above the floor of underground areas (such as basements or tunnels); septic tanks; systems for collecting
stormwater or wastewater; flow-through process tanks; emergency spill and overfill tanks that are expeditiously
emptied after use; and tanks holding 110 gallons or less (42 U.S.C. 6991(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, and of particular importance to today's proposal, the statute excludes one type of potential ``owner''
from the corrective action requirements applicable to owners. Specifically, the statute excludes from the definition
of owner any person ``who, without participating in the management of an UST, and otherwise not engaged in petroleum
production, refining, and marketing, holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect the owner's security interest
in the tank'' (RCRA section 9003(h)(9), 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h)(9)). This statutory provision is intended to exempt from
cleanup responsibility a person whose only connection with a tank is as the holder of a security interest; i.e., a bank
or other secured creditor who has extended credit to a borrower (commonly the tank's owner) and who has in return secured
the loan or other obligation by taking a security interest in the tank. EPA has promulgated regulations governing
corrective action under subtitle I. (See 40 CFR part 280, &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.67.) The regulation proposed
today addresses the requirements of subtitle I that are applicable to a person who holds a security interest in a tank
(a ``security holder'' or merely ``holder'') from the time that the person extends the credit up through and including
foreclosure and re-sale. As described in this proposed rule, a holder may face obligations either as an owner or as
an operator, depending upon the specific activities undertaken by the holder.

III. The UST Security Interest Exemption and Intent of Today's Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The security interest exemption under subtitle I, section 9003(h)(9) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h)(9), provides:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As used in this subsection, the term ``owner'' does not include any person who, without participating in the management
of an underground storage tank and otherwise not engaged in petroleum production, refining, and marketing, holds
indicia of ownership primarily to protect the owner's security interest in the tank.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Limited legislative history exists concerning the RCRA subtitle I security interest exemption. No guidance or other
indication is available concerning the types of activities that Congress considered to be consistent with the subtitle
I security interest exemption, or about the types of activities that Congress considered to be impermissible participation
in an UST or UST system's management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory exemption is limited to liability for corrective action at petroleum-contaminated sites. Since the
subtitle I security interest exemption applies only to the corrective action requirements for petroleum_Part 280
Subpart F and portions of subpart E, one interpretation of the statute could hold that the holder is not exempt from
complying with other portions of the statute and regulations applicable to an ``owner'' of a tank. These other parts
include 40 CFR part 280, subparts B, C, D, E (&sect;280.50 only), and G (hereafter referred to as the ``UST technical
standards'' for purposes of this rule), and Subpart H_Financial Responsibility. However, the statute is silent
with respect to a holder's liability for these requirements solely as a consequence of having ownership rights in
a tank primarily to protect a security interest. The Agency does not believe that these limited ownership rights rise
to the level of full ``ownership'' sufficient to make the holder an ``owner'' of the tank, as that term is used in section
9001(3) of RCRA subtitle I. Therefore, EPA is proposing, under its broad rulemaking authority in section 9003, that
a holder who meets the criteria specified in this proposed rule (i.e., whose only connection with the tank is as the
bona fide holder of a security interest in the UST or UST system) is not subject to the UST technical standards and financial
responsibility requirements otherwise applicable to a tank owner. EPA believes that this is both appropriate under
the Agency's rulemaking authority and consistent with Congressional intent in providing the section 9003(h)(9)
exemption for those persons who provide only financing to owners of a tank. Accordingly, a qualifying holder will
not be required to comply with the full panoply of EPA regulations implementing subtitle I that apply to tank owners
prior to or following foreclosure, provided that the requirements of today's proposed rule are satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to a holder's potential to be an ``operator'' of a tank prior to foreclosure, consistent with the provisions
of this proposed rule, the holder typically will not be involved in the day-to-day operations of the tank, and will
therefore not incur liability as an ``operator.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 By foreclosing, however, the holder takes affirmative action with respect to the tank and displaces the borrower;
therefore, by necessity, the holder has taken ``control of .&blank;.&blank;. [and] responsibility for .&blank;.&blank;.''
the tank, and is therefore a tank operator under the definition at 42 U.S.C. 6991(4). However, under today's proposed
rule, a foreclosing holder's responsibility for corrective action as an operator is limited in certain circumstances:
In general, a holder's obligations would be limited under the provisions of this rule where the foreclosed-on tank
is no longer storing petroleum, or where the holder itself empties the tank within a certain time period. In these circumstances,
while a holder is an operator and therefore subject to the UST program's technical requirements and other obligations,
a holder may remain exempt from the corrective action requirements and satisfy the technical requirements by exercising
one of the options for compliance described in Section III. D. 2 of this preamble. These options allow a holder to satisfy
its regulatory obligations as an ``operator'' by undertaking specified minimally burdensome and environmentally
protective actions to secure and protect the UST or UST system. On the other hand, a holder who operates a tank by, for
example, storing or dispensing product following foreclosure will be subject to the full range of requirements applicable
to any person operating a tank (including corrective action requirements).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Of course, a lender which has control of or responsibility for the daily operation of a tank would be an ``operator''
under section 9001(4), and therefore subject to all requirements applicable to an operator of a tank, including corrective
action. Similarly, such acts may also constitute ``participation in the management'' of the tank, which would void
the section 9003(h)(9) exemption and obligate the lender to comply with these same technical, financial, and corrective
action requirements as an owner.

In developing today's proposal, EPA examined the potential obligations under subtitle I of government entities
that act as conservators or receivers of assets acquired from failed lending and depository institutions, such as
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). Where a government entity
or its designee is acting as a conservator or receiver, EPA interprets the security interest exemption in RCRA subtitle
I section 9003(h)(9) to preclude the imposition of the insolvent estate's liabilities against the government entity
acting as the conservator or receiver, and considers the liabilities of the institution being administered to be
limited to the institution's assets. The situation of a conservator or receiver of a failed or insolvent lending institution
is analogous to that of a trustee (particularly a trustee in bankruptcy) that is administering an insolvent's estate
and, in accordance with those principles, the insolvent's liabilities are to be satisfied from the estate being administered
and not from the assets of the conservator or receiver. Therefore, satisfaction of an estate's debts or liabilities
would not reach the general assets of the FDIC, the RTC, those of any other government entity acting in a similar capacity,
or those of a private person acting on behalf of the government conservator or receiver.

B. Legal Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legal basis for this proposed rule is the Agency's broad authority to issue regulations interpreting and implementing
the provisions of RCRA subtitle I at issue in this proposal. Section 9003(b), 42 U.S.C. 6991b(b) provides EPA with
authority to ``promulgate release detection, prevention, and correction regulations applicable to all owners
and operators of underground storage tanks, as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing to define the regulatory terms under which a secured creditor may, consistent with the statutory
exemption, avoid responsibility for corrective action as an owner and operator of an underground storage tank, as
well as proposing an exemption from certain financial responsibility requirements. As discussed elsewhere in this
preamble (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section III.D), the statutory exemption from corrective action liability addresses only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
owners
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of underground storage tanks, while the statute and EPA's implementing regulations extend liability to both owners
and operators. The Agency believes that without promulgating a rule under EPA's broad grant of rulemaking authority
applying the protection found in the statutory security interest exemption to operators as well as owners, the statutory
exemption may be rendered virtually meaningless, since an owner of an UST is also typically an UST operator. EPA does
not believe that Congress, in creating section 9003(h)(9), intended for an otherwise exempt holder of a security
interest to nonetheless fall subject to corrective action obligations as an operator. As such, EPA's exercise of
its rulemaking authority in the proposed rule is appropriate and, perhaps, needed to fully effectuate the purpose
of the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Agency has explicit rulemaking authority to, in its discretion, exempt certain classes of owners
and operators from corrective action obligations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 holders of security interests as described in this proposal). Section 9003(b) permits the Agency, in promulgating
regulations under subtitle I, to make distinctions in its UST regulations between types or classes of tanks, based
upon, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``the technical capability of the owners and operators.'' Because security interest holders are typically not as
a general matter engaged in the operation and maintenance of USTs (and thus do not possess the technical capacity of
most UST owners and operators), EPA does not believe that requiring them to comply with highly detailed technical
requirements is appropriate where requiring them to do so is not necessary for protection of human health and the environment.
Furthermore, the Agency believes an exemption from these regulatory requirements is appropriate in the context
of this proposed rule, where an exemption will serve, albeit indirectly, to advance the goals of subtitle I by making
credit more available and thus aiding in the implementation of tank upgrade requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, this authority is not open-ended, as section 9003(a) requires EPA to promulgate regulations that are protective
of human health and the environment. Without compromising the level of protectiveness established by the UST program,
EPA previously relied on its section 9003(b) authority when it excluded a group of owners and operators from RCRA subtitle
I requirements in the final Financial Responsibility Rule (53 FR 43322, Oct. 26, 1988). (In relevant part, the preamble
to the final Financial Responsibility Rule states: ``The Agency does not interpret the Congressional intent of subtitle
I to preclude exempting any class of USTs from otherwise applicable requirements when the Agency has determined that
such requirements are not necessary to protect human health or the environment.'') That rule exempted states and
the federal government from the UST financial responsibility requirements since those entities were, as a class,
able to satisfy the purpose of the financial responsibility requirements in the absence of regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, for purposes of this proposal, EPA believes that it is reasonable, in light of the purposes behind this
proposal, to exempt a holder from RCRA subtitle I corrective action requirements as an operator if its USTs are empty
and secure (as would be required under today's proposal) or if the holder chooses to also engage in environmentally
beneficial activities (as discussed in Section III. E of this preamble). Because of the requirements a holder must
meet before enjoying this proposed exemption, EPA's UST regulations will satisfy the statutory requirement that
they be protective of human health and the environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following sections describe the key terms used in this proposed rule. For the most part, these are also terms used
in the section 9003(h)(9) security interest exemption. This section specifies the activities that are not ``participating
in the management'' of a tank and which a holder may under today's proposal, engage in consistent with subtitle I regulatory
requirements.

``Production of petroleum'' includes, but is not limited to, activities involved in the production of crude oil or
other forms of petroleum, as well as the production of petroleum products from purchased materials, either domestically
or abroad. ``Refining'' includes the processes of cracking, distillation, separation, conversion, upgrading,
and finishing of refined petroleum or petroleum products. ``Marketing'' includes the distribution, transfer,
or sale of petroleum or petroleum products for wholesale or retail purposes. A holder who stores petroleum products
in USTs for on-site consumption only, such as to provide heat to an office building or to refuel its own vehicles, is
not considered to be engaged in petroleum production, refining, or marketing for the purposes of the UST regulatory
program.

EPA is proposing that ``indicia of ownership'' means ownership or evidence of an ownership interest in a petroleum
UST or UST system. EPA is not proposing to limit or qualify type, quality, or quantity of ownership indicia that may
be held by a person for the purpose of the regulatory exemption. The nature of the ownership interest may vary according
to the type of secured transaction and the nature of the holder's relationship (such as that of a guarantor or surety).
Accordingly, indicia of ownership may be evidence of any ownership interest or right to an UST or UST system, such as
a security interest, an interest in a security interest, or any other interest in an UST or UST system. For purposes
of this proposed rule, examples of such indicia include, but are not limited to, a mortgage, deed of trust, or legal
or equitable title obtained pursuant to foreclosure or its equivalents, a surety bond, guarantee of an obligation,
or an assignment, lien, pledge, or other right to or form of encumbrance against an UST or UST system. Accordingly,
it is not necessary for a person to hold actual title or a security interest in order to maintain some indicia or evidence
of ownership in an UST or UST system.

3. Primarily To Protect a Security Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing that the term ``primarily to protect a security interest'' as used in this proposed regulation means
a holder's indicia of ownership are held primarily for the purpose of securing payment or performance of an obligation.
EPA intends this phrase to require that the ownership interest be maintained primarily for the purpose of, or primarily
in connection with, securing payment or performance of a loan or other obligation (a security interest), and not an
interest in the UST or UST system held for some other reason.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A security interest may arise pursuant to a variety of statutory or common law financing transactions. While a security
interest is ordinarily created by mutual consent, such as a secured transaction within the scope of Article 9 of the
Uniform Commercial Code, there are other means by which a security interest may be created, some of which may or may
not be the result of a consensual arrangement between the parties to the transaction. In general, a transaction that
gives rise to a security interest within the ambit of this proposed rule is one that provides the holder with recourse
against an UST or UST system of the person pledging the security; the purpose of the interest is to secure the repayment
of money, the performance of a duty, or of some other obligation.

 (1941).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a matter of general law, security interests may arise from transactions in which an interest in an UST or UST system
is created or established for the purpose of securing a loan or other obligation, and includes mortgages, deeds of
trust, liens, and title held pursuant to lease financing transactions. Security interests may also arise from transactions
such as sale-and-leasebacks, conditional sales, installment sales, trust receipt transactions, certain assignments,
factoring agreements or accounts receivable financing agreements, consignments, among others, provided that
the transaction creates or establishes an interest in an UST or UST system for the purpose of securing a loan or other
obligation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, ``indicia of ownership'' held ``primarily to protect [a] security interest'' do not include evidence
of interests in the nature of an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
investment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the UST or UST system, or an ownership interest held primarily for any reason other than as protection for a security
interest. The person holding ownership indicia to protect a security interest may have additional, secondary reasons
for maintaining the indicia in addition to protecting a security interest; maintaining indicia for reasons in addition
to protecting a security interest may be consistent with the exemption and this proposed rule. However, any such additional
reasons must be secondary to protecting a security interest in the secured UST or UST system. EPA recognizes that lending
institutions have revenue interests in the loan transactions that create security interests; such revenue interests
are not considered to be investment interests, but are considered secured transactions falling within the proposed
security interest regulatory exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. ``Holder'' of Ownership Indicia
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A ``holder'' as used in this proposed regulation is a person who maintains ownership indicia primarily to protect
a security interest, however acquired or held. The term ``holder'' includes the initial holder (such as the loan originator)
and any subsequent holder, such as a successor-in-interest, subsequent purchaser on the secondary market, loan
guarantor, surety, or other person who maintains indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest.
The term also includes any person acting on behalf of or for the benefit of the holder, such as a court-appointed receiver
or a holder's agent, employee, or representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, it should be noted that lending institutions, which typically hold a large number of security interests,
may also act in some trustee, fiduciary, or other capacity with respect to an UST or UST system. However, this rule does
not address circumstances in which a lending institution or any person acts as a trustee, or in a non-lending capacity,
or has any interest in an UST or UST system other than as provided in this rule. Because this proposed regulation, as
well as the exemption in section 9003(h)(9), addresses only persons who maintain a ``security interest,'' any discussion
of persons with other interests or involvement in an UST or UST system is beyond the scope of this proposed rule. Of course,
a trustee or other fiduciary with respect to an UST or UST system (or any person who independent of the status as trustee
or fiduciary) who holds indicia of ownership in the UST or UST system primarily to protect a security interest may fall
within this proposed security interest regulatory exemption.

5. Participating in Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA proposes that, as used in this proposed rule, ``participation in the management of an UST or UST system'' means
the actual involvement in the management or control of decisionmaking related to the UST or UST system by the holder.
Participation in management does not include the mere capacity or unexercised right or ability to influence UST or
UST system operations. This proposal contains a list of activities that is not all-inclusive, but which generally
describes activities that are not considered to be evidence that a holder is participating in the management of an
UST or UST system. In addition, to address those other activities not specifically listed, a general test of management
participation is proposed. The general test specifies that a holder is considered to be participating in management,
within the scope of this proposed regulatory exemption, when it exercises decisionmaking control over the borrower's
UST or UST system, or where the holder assumes overall management responsibility encompassing decisionmaking authority
over the enterprise that includes day-to-day operation of the UST or UST system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, activities that are evidence that a holder is participating in the management of an UST or
UST system, and thus acting outside the scope of this proposed regulatory exemption, include: Exercising management
control or decisionmaking authority over operational aspects of an UST or UST system, or securing a lease agreement,
contractual arrangement, or employee relationship with any other person to manage or operate the UST or UST system.
Such activities indicate that a holder is involved in or exercising decisionmaking control of operations of the UST
or UST system in which the holder has a security interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this proposed rule, a holder performing the functions of a plant manager, operations manager, chief
operating officer, chief executive officer, and the like, of the facility or business at which the UST is located is
considered to be exercising management control or decisionmaking authority over the operational aspects of the
UST or UST system and therefore, participating in management, unless the responsibilities for the position specifically
exclude all UST responsibilities. Control over the operational aspects of management should not be confused, however,
with those activities which constitute administrative or financial management or involvement in non-operational
activities. Such activities may be engaged in by a holder in the course of managing a loan portfolio and do not exceed
the boundaries of the security interest exemption. Such activities may include providing financial or other assistance,
environmental investigations or monitoring of the borrower's business and collateral, engaging in ``loan work
out'' activities, foreclosing on a secured UST or UST system, winding down operations following foreclosure or its
equivalents, or divesting itself of the foreclosed-on property containing an UST or UST system. These, as well as
other actions related to a holder's financial and administrative obligations, are discussed in more detail in the
following section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General Test of Management Participation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It is not possible to specifically cover in this proposed rule or any regulation every conceivable situation in which
a holder might act, or to make specific provisions for every action that a holder might undertake that might make it
ineligible for the protection of the proposed security interest regulatory exemption, voiding the security interest
exemption. A general test or standard of participation in an UST or UST system's management has therefore been formulated
to provide a framework within which to assess the consistency of a holder's actions with the limitations of the proposed
regulatory exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal's two-prong test or standard of management participation provides that while the borrower is still
in possession of an UST or UST system (i.e., pre-foreclosure), a holder participates in the management of an UST or
UST system only where the holder either exercises decisionmaking control over the UST or UST system, or where the holder's
actions manifest or assume responsibility for the overall management of the UST or UST system's day-to-day operations.
The general test adopts a functional approach which focuses on the holder's actual decisionmaking involvement in
the operational (as opposed to the financial or administrative) affairs of the borrower's UST or UST system. The first
prong looks to whether the holder has exercised decisionmaking control over the borrower's environmental compliance.
If so, the holder is ``participating in the management'' of the UST or UST system as defined in the proposed rule. Similarly,
the second prong looks to where the holder is functioning as the overall manager by exercising management at a level
encompassing the borrower's environmental obligations, or over all or substantially all of the operational aspects
of the borrower's enterprise, regardless of whether decisionmaking control over compliance with the regulations
governing the UST or UST system has been explicitly assumed or not. This level of actual involvement in the management
of the UST or UST system is sufficient to constitute management participation for purposes of this proposed regulatory
exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the first prong of the general test, a holder cannot remain within the scope of the exemption if it controls the
borrower's environmental compliance activities associated with the UST or UST system. Under the second prong of
the general test, the ability to carve out environmental compliance responsibilities from other operational aspects
of the borrower's business or enterprise demonstrates that the holder has manifested or assumed operational responsibility
at a management level that includes environmental matters, and in doing so is considered to be participating in the
UST or UST system's management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, management participation does not include the unexercised right to become involved in operational UST
or UST system decisionmaking. In other words, if the holder does not exercise its rights to participate in the management
of the UST or UST system, it still may qualify for the security interest exemption. Whether the exercise of rights that
a holder might have_whether under contract or other agreement (if any) or otherwise, including the enforcement of
loan terms and covenants or other rights_rises to the level of participation in the UST or UST system's management
is measured by reference to the general test.

Actions that are not participation in management
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Participation in the following activities will not exclusively, in themselves, exceed the bounds of this proposed
regulatory exemption: Policing the loan, undertaking financial work out with a borrower where the obligation is
in default or in threat of default, undertaking foreclosing and winding up operations (as described later in this
proposal), or preparing the UST or UST system for sale or liquidation. In addition, the holder is not considered to
be participating in the management of the UST or UST system by monitoring the borrower's business; by requiring or
conducting on-site investigations, including site assessments, inspections, and audits, of the environmental
condition of the UST or UST system or the borrower's financial condition; by monitoring other aspects of the UST or
UST system considered relevant or necessary by the holder; by requiring certification of financial information
or compliance with applicable duties, laws, or regulations, or by requiring other similar actions, provided that
the holder does not otherwise participate in the management or operation of the UST or UST system, as provided in this
proposed regulation. Such oversight and obligations of compliance imposed by the holder are not considered part
of the management of an UST or UST system. Although such requirements and oversight may inform and perhaps strongly
influence the borrower's management of an UST or UST system, the holder is not considered to be participating in management
where the borrower continues to make operational decisions concerning the UST or UST system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The protected activities of a holder that are specifically identified in this rule are consistent with the language
of RCRA section 9003(h)(9) and the overall purpose of subtitle I. Judicial decisions construing the substantially
similar language of CERCLA section 101(20)(A) have addressed the issue of the appropriate degree of a holder's involvement
at a facility in which it held a security interest (i.e., the standard of ``participation in management''). Although
the cases articulated the CERCLA standard using different language, these cases generally held that the exemption
is abrogated once a holder has divested the borrower or debtor of its management authority prior to foreclosure, such
as when the holder becomes involved in the facility's day-to-day operations, where it becomes overly entangled in
the affairs of the facility, or where its involvement otherwise affects a facility's hazardous waste practices.

While the cases listed above describe particular activities and draw a line between the actions of a holder that are
and are not evidence of management participation for purposes of CERCLA, there remains uncertainty about the effect
of activities commonly or routinely undertaken by a holder in the course of managing a loan secured by an UST or UST system.
EPA believes that the uncertainty created for holders examining their potential for liability under CERCLA also
exist when holders assess their potential obligations under RCRA subtitle I. Therefore, this proposed rule is intended
to specify the compliance obligations for lenders when conducting normal business activities and to define with
greater precision the point at which a holder's actions pass from loan oversight and advice to actual UST or UST system
management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following sections discuss and describe the specific activities of a holder that the proposed rule defines as
either activities that indicate the holder's participation in the management of an UST or UST system or those that
are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 instances of participation in the management of an UST or UST system by a person holding indicia of ownership primarily
to protect a security interest in the UST or UST system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It bears repeating, however, that the activities identified in this proposed rule do not specify the only activities
that may be undertaken by a holder without losing the protection of the proposed security interest regulatory exemption,
and one should not infer that activities not specifically mentioned in this rule are automatically considered evidence
of participation in an UST or UST system's management_those must be addressed on a case-by-case basis based on the
general test provided in this rule.

Actions at the inception of the loan or other transaction giving rise to a security interest.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Actions undertaken by a holder prior to the inception of a transaction in which indicia of ownership are held primarily
to protect a security interest are irrelevant with respect to the general test of participation in management, and
thus are not considered evidence of participation in the management of the UST or UST system. Thus, consultation and
negotiation concerning the structure and terms of the loan or other obligation, the payment of interest, the payment
period, and specific or general financial or other advice, suggestions, counseling, guidance, or other actions
at or prior to the time that indicia of ownership are first held are not considered evidence of participation in the
management of the UST or UST system for purposes of this proposed rule. Activities that take place

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to such pre-loan involvement, a holder may determine (whether for risk management or any other business
purpose) to undertake or require an environmental investigation (which could include a site assessment, inspection,
and/or audit) of an UST or UST system securing the loan or other obligation. Such environmental investigation may
be undertaken by the holder, for example, or the holder may require one to be conducted by another party (such as the
borrower) as a condition of the loan or other transaction. Neither RCRA Subtitle I nor this proposed rule require that
such an environmental investigation be undertaken to qualify for the security interest exemption, and the obligations
of a holder seeking to avail itself of the exemption cannot be based on or affected by the holder's not conducting or
not requiring an environmental investigation in connection with the security interest. Similarly, a holder is not
engaged in management participation solely as a result of undertaking or requiring an environmental investigation,
and nothing in this proposed rule should be understood to discourage a holder from undertaking or requiring such an
environmental investigation in circumstances deemed appropriate by the holder. Because lender-conducted or -required
investigations of a borrower's business or collateral are information-gathering in nature, such activities cannot,
alone, be considered to be management participation by a holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that a pre-loan environmental investigation of a UST or UST system reveals contamination, the holder
may undertake any one of a variety of responses that it deems appropriate: For example, the holder may refuse to extend
credit or to follow through with the transaction or instead maintain indicia of ownership in other, non-contaminated
property as protection for the security interest. Alternatively, a holder may determine that the risk of default
is sufficiently slight (or that the extent of contamination is minimal and does not significantly affect the value
of the UST or UST system as collateral) to proceed to extend credit and maintain indicia of ownership in the UST or UST
system. Additionally, the holder may require the borrower to clean up the contamination as a condition for extending
the loan. Such activities are not considered participation in the UST or UST system's management, and a holder that
knowingly takes a security interest in contaminated collateral is not subject to compliance with the RCRA Subtitle
I corrective action regulatory program solely on this basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Policing the security interest or loan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A holder may undertake actions that are consistent with holding ownership indicia primarily to protect a security
interest which include, but are not limited to, a requirement that the borrower clean up a release from the UST or UST
system which may have occurred prior to or during the life of the loan or security interest (as described in the last
section); a requirement of assurance of the borrower's compliance with applicable federal, state, and local environmental
or other laws and regulations during the life of the loan or security interest; securing authority or permission for
the holder to periodically or regularly monitor or inspect the UST or UST system in which the holder possesses indicia
of ownership, or the borrower's business or financial condition, or both; or to comply with legal requirements to
which the holder is subject; or other requirements or conditions by which the holder is able to police adequately the
loan or security interest, provided that the exercise by the holder of such other loan policing activities are not
considered evidence of management participation as provided in the proposed rule's ``general test'' of management
participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authority for the holder to take such actions may be contained in contractual (e.g., loan) documents or other relevant
documents specifying requirements for financial, environmental, and other warranties, covenants, and representations
or promises from the borrower. While the regulatory exemption in this proposed rule requires that the actions undertaken
by a holder in overseeing or managing the loan or other obligation be consistent with those of a person whose indicia
of ownership in an UST or UST system is held primarily to protect a security interest, a holder is not expected to be an
insurer or guarantor of environmental safety or quality at a secured UST or UST system. The inclusion of environmental
warranties and covenants is not considered to be evidence of a holder's acting as an insurer or guarantor, and a finding
of ``management participation'' cannot be premised solely on the existence of such terms or upon the holder's actions
that ensure that the UST or UST system is managed in an environmentally sound manner. Since these actions are consistent
with holding indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest, they are not considered to be participation
in management in this proposed rule.

Loan work out.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The holder may determine that actions need to be taken with respect to the UST or UST system to safeguard the security
interest from loss. These actions may be necessary when, for example, a loan is in default or threat of default, and
are commonly referred to as ``loan work out'' activities. ``Loan work out'' is largely an undefined term but is generally
understood in the financial community to mean those activities undertaken to prevent, mitigate, or cure a default
by the obligor or to preserve or prevent the diminution of the value of the security. Loan work out activities are recognized
by EPA as a common lender undertaking and, as such, these actions will not take a holder outside of the scope of the security
interest exemption provided for in this proposed rule, provided that such actions are consistent with the proposed
general test of management participation.

When the holder undertakes loan work out activities, provides financial or other advice, or similar support to a financially
distressed borrower, the holder will remain within the scope of the proposed security interest regulatory exemption
only so long as the holder does not participate in management as provided by this proposed rule's general test. Loan
work out actions that are not evidence of ``participation in management'' include, but are not limited to: Restructuring
or renegotiating the terms of the security interest; requiring payment of additional rent or interest; exercising
forbearance with regard to the security interest; requiring or exercising rights pursuant to an assignment of accounts
or other amounts owing to an obligor; requiring or exercising rights pursuant to an escrow agreement pertaining to
amounts owing to an obligor; providing specific or general financial or other advice, suggestions, counseling,
or guidance; and exercising any right or remedy the holder is entitled to by law or under any warranties, covenants,
conditions, representations, or promises from the borrower.

Foreclosure and sale or liquidation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Foreclosure and possession of property for purposes of sale or liquidation are often the only remedy the holder may
have to secure performance of an obligation. The process of foreclosure and sale or liquidation of a foreclosed-on
UST or UST system often results in the exclusive possession of the UST or UST system by the holder and may require or result
in the holder's taking record title to the UST or UST system under the laws of some states. For purposes of this proposed
rule, the term ``foreclosure or its equivalents'' includes foreclosure, purchase at foreclosure sale, acquisition
or assignment of title in lieu of foreclosure, acquisition of a right to possession or title, or other agreement in
settlement of the loan obligation, or any other formal or informal manner by which the holder acquires possession
of the borrower's collateral for subsequent disposition in partial or full satisfaction of the underlying obligation.
These actions are considered to fall within the scope of the proposed regulatory exemption as necessary incidents
to holding ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest. However, a holder is under the coverage of
the proposed rule and is not considered an ``owner'' of a UST or UST system only so long as the holder's acquisition pursuant
to foreclosure is reasonably necessary to ensure satisfaction or performance of the obligation, is temporary in
nature, and occurs while the holder is actively seeking to sell or otherwise divest the foreclosed-on UST or UST system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To meet the requirements of the proposed rule's exemption from regulatory compliance as an ``owner'' following foreclosure,
a holder must be acting consistently with the security interest exemption's requirement that the ownership indicia
maintained by the holder continue to be held primarily to protect the security interest. Where a holder's actions
indicate that it is not seeking to sell or liquidate the secured assets, the exemption is voided because such actions
are akin to holding the asset for investment purposes. This proposed regulation describes circumstances under which
a holder may avoid being considered an ``owner'' of property on which it forecloses for purposes of certain Subtitle
I regulations. It is only by complying with the provisions of this proposed rule that the limited ownership rights
of a security holder do not rise to the level of full ``ownership'' sufficient to make the security holder an ``owner''
of the tank, as that term is used in EPA's UST regulations. The proposed rule first provides a set of general criteria
for offering an UST or UST system for sale, and when and under what circumstances an offer of purchase may or may not be
rejected. In addition, even though a holder is permitted to use whatever means are appropriate and available to sell
or otherwise divest itself of foreclosed-on property, as a measure of certainty this proposed rule contains an objective
test that, if followed by a holder, establishes that the holder is meeting the general obligation to divest itself
of a foreclosed-on UST or UST system in a reasonably expeditious manner. EPA believes that this aspect of the proposed
rule is consistent with the RCRA Subtitle I security interest exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, under this proposal, a foreclosing holder must, in order to maintain consistency with the security interest
exemption, seek to sell or otherwise divest itself of foreclosed-on property in a reasonably expeditious manner
using whatever commercially reasonable means are available or appropriate, taking all facts and circumstances
into account. A holder cannot, under the terms of the proposed rule, reject or refuse offers for the property that represent
fair consideration for the asset and remain within the proposed regulatory exemption. A holder that outbids or refuses
offers from parties offering fair consideration for the property establishes that the property is no longer being
held primarily to protect a security interest. The terms of the bid are relevant for this purpose, and a holder is not
required to accept offers that would require it to breach duties owed to other holders, the borrower, or other persons
with interests in the property that are owed a legal duty. In addition, the term ``fair consideration'' refers to an
all cash offer, which is intended to ensure that this proposed rule would not require a holder to accept a bid that contains
unacceptable conditions, such as requirements for indemnification agreements, non-cash offers, ``bundled''
offers, etc. This proposed provision should not be read to require that a holder may accept only cash offers, however;
a holder is always free to accept any offer satisfactory to the holder. The exact requirement that would be imposed
by this proposed regulation is that a holder may not reject a cash offer of fair consideration for the foreclosed-on
property. If it does, or if it outbids others offering fair consideration, then the holder would, under today's proposal,
be considered to be an owner of the UST or UST system in the same manner as any other purchaser.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule's provisions defining ``fair consideration'' and specifying when the foreclosing holder may
reject or outbid offers for the property are formulated to reflect the amount that the holder may bid at the foreclosure
sale, or not reject during the foreclosure sale or thereafter, in order to recover on its loan or other obligation.
In addition, there may be multiple security interests in a borrower's property held by secured creditors, which the
definition of ``fair consideration'' must account for. Therefore, for a senior creditor, the term ``fair consideration''
is proposed to mean a cash amount that represents a value equal to or greater than the outstanding obligation owed to
the holder (including the fees, penalties, and other charges incurred by the holder in connection with the property).
``Fair consideration'' is further proposed to indicate that the amount that will recover the holder's ``security
interest'' in the property may vary depending on the seniority of the loan or other obligation that is being foreclosed
upon. Specifically, a junior creditor may be required to outbid senior creditors in order to recover the value of its
loan or other obligation. The definition of fair consideration therefore distinguishes between what junior or senior
creditors may bid or not reject for purposes of maintaining the exemption. In addition, in order to avoid liability
under law (for example, to the borrower), the foreclosing holder may be required to seek an amount at the foreclosure
sale that is greater than the outstanding obligation owed to the foreclosing holder, or to sell the property in a different
manner; therefore, the proposed rule does not require a holder to accept an offer of ``fair consideration'' if to do
so would subject the holder to liability under federal or state law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this way the proposed rule's provisions with respect to the sale or disposition of property will not conflict with
the manner in which such sales are required to be conducted under general principles of law applicable to the holder
and the disposition of the property including the UST. For purposes of this proposed rule, the definition of ``fair
consideration'' is an objective, ``bright-line'' test to determine whether the foreclosing holder has an investment
or other interest in the property that is not within the exemption, or whether the holder's post-foreclosure activities
indicate that it continues to maintain its ownership indicia in the property primarily to protect a security interest,
and is therefore within the protective ambit of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While a holder may use whatever means are reasonable and appropriate for marketing foreclosed-on property to establish
that it is seeking to divest itself of property in an expeditious manner, this proposed rule also provides a mechanism
by which a holder can definitely establish that it continues to hold indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security
interest and is not an ``owner,'' for purposes of complying with the UST regulatory program, of foreclosed-on property.
This mechanism is intended to act as another ``bright line'' to provide clear and unambiguous evidence that a holder
is not the UST or UST system's ``owner'' following foreclosure: A holder choosing to avail itself of this bright line
test must, within 12 months following the acquisition of marketable title, list the property with a broker, dealer,
or agent who deals with the type of property in question, or advertise the property as being for sale or disposition
on at least a monthly basis in either a real estate publication or a trade or other publication suitable for the property
in question, or a newspaper of general circulation (defined as one with a circulation over 10,000, or one suitable
under any applicable federal, state, or local rules of court for publication required by court order or rules of civil
procedure) covering the area where the property is located. If the holder satisfies these criteria, the holder is
considered to have complied with the requirement in the proposed rule that it is seeking to sell or otherwise divest
the property in an expeditious manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also recognizes that market conditions, the condition of the property, and other factors may mean that despite
reasonable efforts to expeditiously sell or divest foreclosed-on property, the property may not be quickly sold.
Therefore, this regulation does not impose a time requirement for the ultimate disposition of foreclosed-on property.
Provided that the property is being actively offered for sale by the holder and no offers of fair consideration are
ignored, outbid, or rejected, foreclosed-on property may continue to be held by the holder without the holder being
considered an ``owner'' of the UST or UST system for purposes of complying with the UST regulatory program, as detailed
in this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of the manner in which the foreclosing holder chooses to market the property, if at any time after six months
following the acquisition of marketable title the holder rejects, or does not act upon within 90 days of receipt of,
a written, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
firm offer of fair consideration for the property, the holder will lose the protection of the proposed rule. Under
this proposal, a ``written, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
firm offer'' is a legally enforceable, commercially reasonable, offer, including all material terms of the transaction,
from a ready, willing, and able purchaser who demonstrates to the holder's satisfaction the ability to perform. Where
a holder outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon an offer of fair consideration, the holder is considered, for the purpose
of the proposed regulatory exemption, to be maintaining its indicia of ownership in the property as protection for
investment purposes, and not as security for the obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed exemption from regulatory compliance would also permit a foreclosing holder to undertake actions with
respect to the UST or UST system to protect or preserve the value of the secured asset. For example, a holder may determine
that it needs to take certain actions with respect to an UST or UST system's operations in order to preserve the value
of the foreclosed-on assets or to prevent a future release (such as by the removal of an UST or UST system's contents
as described below), or to otherwise prepare property for safe public access incident to sale or liquidation of assets.
Precisely because a holder in charge of an UST or UST system may need to take affirmative action with respect to the UST
or UST system incident to foreclosure and with respect to any petroleum products that are known to be present, the proposal
provides that such actions of dominion and control over the UST or UST system are considered necessary components
of holding ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest, provided such actions are undertaken to protect
the asset's value and are not undertaken for investment purposes. Therefore, under this proposed rule, such mitigative
or preventative measures are considered to be actions that are consistent with holding ownership indicia primarily
to protect the security interest in the UST or UST system.

(5) Winding up operations after foreclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in the post-foreclosure context, this proposed rule provides that a holder that forecloses on an UST
or UST system with ongoing operations may wind up the UST or UST system's operations without also being considered
to be participating in management. Winding up is considered a protected activity by a foreclosing holder because,
without such protection, foreclosure would not be possible where practical or commercial necessity dictates that
the foreclosing holder undertake such actions. ``Winding up'' in the post-foreclosure context includes those actions
that are necessary to close down an UST or UST system's operations, secure the site, and otherwise protect the value
of the foreclosed assets for subsequent sale or liquidation. In winding up an UST or UST system, a holder may undertake
all necessary security measures or take other actions that protect and preserve an UST or UST system's assets, including
steps taken to prevent or minimize the risk of a release or threat of release of the UST or UST system's contents.

D. Liability of a Holder as an Operator of an Underground Storage Tank or Underground Storage Tank System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this proposed rule would be promulgated under authority to write regulations governing UST activities,
EPA intends that it be consistent with and further the purposes of the statutory security interest exemption found
at Section 9003(h)(9). One critical aspect of the RCRA subtitle I statutory security interest exemption is that while
it excludes a holder from the definition of ``owner'' for corrective action purposes, the statute does not explicitly
address a holder's responsibilities as an UST or UST system ``operator.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The absence of explicit language in the statute regarding operators creates a potential problem for holders, since
EPA's UST 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective action regulations (as described in Section II. B of this preamble) apply to both owners and operators
of underground storage tanks. Thus, although RCRA subtitle I clearly exempts holders from corrective action liability
as ``owners'' of USTs, the statute does not address whether such otherwise exempt persons face correction action
liability as ``operators'' of USTs. Without clear protection from corrective action liability as potential operators
of USTs, EPA believes that lenders will continue to be reluctant to make loans to UST-related businesses due to continued
uncertainty about their potential liability for corrective action. This regulatory proposal therefore addresses
a holder's potential liability for RCRA subtitle I corrective action as an ``operator'' of an UST or UST system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Under RCRA Subtitle I, being an ``operator'' is not synonymous with ``participating in the management'' of an UST
or UST system. Section 9001(3)_Definitions and Exemptions_defines the term ``operator'' to mean ``any person in
control of, or having responsibility for, the daily operation of the UST system.'' A person may, without being an ``operator''
of an UST or UST system, be sufficiently involved so as to be participating in the management (as that term is defined
elsewhere in this proposal) of an UST or UST system.

1. Pre-Foreclosure Operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to foreclosure, a holder who is in control of, or has responsibility for, the daily operation of an UST or UST system
is subject to the full range of requirements applicable to operators of USTs. In addition, a holder may also forfeit
the protection of the proposed regulatory security interest exemption from compliance with the UST regulatory program
as an owner if the holder participates in the management of an UST or UST system as defined in this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a holder will not, as a general matter, have control of, or responsibility for, the daily operation of an UST
or UST system prior to foreclosure in its capacity as a secured creditor who holds indicia of ownership primarily to
protect a security interest. Prior to foreclosure, a holder is permitted to conduct those activities related to its
financial and administrative obligations of managing a loan portfolio. The holder in this position will not lose
its ability to take advantage of the proposed regulatory exemption exclusively as a result of engaging in these activities.
See Section III.C.5 of this preamble for a more complete discussion of this issue.

2. Post-Foreclosure Operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a borrower defaults on its loan obligation and the holder, primarily to protect its security interest, forecloses
on the borrower's UST or UST system, the holder is faced with the decision to continue or suspend the storage or dispensing
of product from the UST. As with activities prior to foreclosure, a holder who operates an UST following foreclosure
(in any manner other than placing the UST in temporary or permanent closure as specified in this proposal) would, under
the current regulatory scheme, be an ``operator'' and subject to all subtitle I requirements. If the holder complies
with the requirements of this rule for placing a tank into temporary or permanent closure, a holder, although nevertheless
an operator, would be exempt from the subtitle I corrective action regulatory requirements otherwise applicable
to operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The strategies for complying with the UST technical standards described in this proposal include emptying tanks,
leaving vent lines open and functioning, capping and securing lines within 15 days after foreclosure, and performing
either temporary or permanent closure of the UST or UST system. Conversely, a foreclosing security holder who exercises
some other strategy for complying with the subtitle I technical requirements (or who fails to comply) could be an ``operator''
under the subtitle I regulations and would therefore be subject to the full panoply of subtitle I regulatory obligations
applicable to all operators of tanks including the corrective action regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As long as an UST or UST system continues to store product, future releases are possible. Consequently, EPA believes
that the best way to ensure that a holder's tanks will not contribute to contamination after the holder has taken possession
of the UST or UST system (particularly if the holder is exempted from EPA's corrective action regulations) is to require
the holder to empty its tanks of all petroleum product. An UST or UST system is empty_in accordance with &sect;280.70_when
all materials have been removed using commonly employed practices so that no more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch)
of residue, or 0.3 percent by weight, of the total capacity of the UST system, remain in the system. To ensure that the
UST system has been adequately secured, vent lines must be left open and functioning, and all other lines, pumps, manways,
and ancillary equipment must be capped and secured (&sect;280.70). Under today's proposal, holders who engage in
these activities within 15 days after foreclosure will be exempted from the corrective action requirements applicable
to ``operators.'' This is a reasonable condition on which to base this exemption since the threat of future contamination
will have been effectively abated for the temporary period of time that the property remains in foreclosure by emptying
the tank and complying with the other requirements of 40 CFR part 280, as described in this proposed rule. Compliance
with these requirements will also satisfy the technical requirements applicable to foreclosing holders as ``operators''
under the rule proposed today. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that 15 days be allowed to empty the tank, and cap and secure all lines and equipment based on its familiarity
with companies that specialize in providing UST technical services and on the Agency's knowledge of the steps required
to properly complete these tasks. Based on this, EPA proposes that 15 days is a reasonable and adequate time frame that
limits the period of time during which a tank containing petroleum product may be left largely unattended. However,
the Agency is interested in receiving comments from any holders who feel that a 15-day time frame would be inadequate
for a holder to arrange for the completion of these tasks. EPA requests comments and data about the adequacy of a 15-day
time frame and information supporting an alternative time frame. Information supporting EPA's proposed time frame
is available from the Agency OUST docket, reference number UST 3&hyph;16. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to emptying and securing the UST or UST system, a holder who wishes to take advantage of the proposed exemption
from subtitle I corrective action regulatory requirements as an operator must comply with the subtitle I requirements
for either temporary or permanent closure. A holder who chooses to permanently close its UST or UST system, must do
so in accordance with &sect;&sect;280.71 through 280.74, Subpart G_Out of Service UST Systems and Closure. A holder
who chooses to temporarily close its tanks is required, throughout the first 12 months following foreclosure, to
maintain corrosion protection and report any known or suspected releases from the UST system. In accordance with
&sect;280.70, release detection is not required as long as the UST system is empty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, after 12 months in temporary closure status, the holder possesses an UST or UST system that does not meet either
the performance standards in &sect;280.20 for new UST systems or the upgrading requirements in &sect;280.21 (excluding
the spill and overfill equipment requirements), and the holder has not successfully disposed of the UST or UST system,
the holder must either permanently close the UST system in accordance with &sect;&sect;280.71 through 280.74 or
perform a site assessment in accordance with &sect;280.72(a) and apply for an extension through the appropriate
implementing agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A holder will only need to perform a site assessment if it has failed to sell or otherwise divest of its UST or UST system
property within 12 months after entering temporary closure and only if the tanks it has acquired have not been upgraded
or replaced to meet the requirements of &sect;280.20 for new UST systems or &sect;280.21 for upgraded systems. (UST
systems that are adequately protected from corrosion and equipped with leak detection devices pose a significantly
lower threat to human health and the environment than do substandard tanks.) The site assessment requirement can
also be satisfied if one of the external release detection methods allowed in &sect;280.43(e) or (f) is operating
at the end of the 12-month period, and the release detection method operating indicates that no release has occurred.
For those who are still in possession of tanks 12 months after foreclosure, many are expected to possess upgraded or
replaced tanks since much of the credit that is expected to be extended subsequent to this rule should be used for upgrading
or replacing substandard tanks. Under these circumstances, the holder would be allowed to remain in temporary closure
indefinitely. Therefore, EPA believes that few situations should call for a site assessment while the holder is in
temporary closure. For those cases in which a holder will find it necessary to perform a site assessment and apply for
a temporary closure extension, EPA does not believe that such a requirement will pose a significant additional burden
upon the holder, since it is increasingly a standard business practice for a site assessment to be conducted upon most
transfers of commercial property. (See Guidelines for an Environmental Risk Program, Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, February 25, 1993.) While in some cases the requirement may oblige a holder to perform a site assessment
sooner (within 12 months after foreclosure) rather than later (upon the date of sale or disposition of the UST or UST
system), EPA expects that in most cases a site assessment will, in all probability, be performed before the UST or UST
system is transferred to a subsequent purchaser.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the provision that requires an UST owner and operator to perform a site assessment in order to apply for
an extension 12 months after entering temporary closure (if a substandard UST or UST system has not been replaced or
upgraded) was to allow a variance mechanism for UST owners to avoid permanent closure of tanks, on a case-by-case basis.
The reason for requiring the site assessment before applying for an extension was based on EPA's concerns that prior
contamination could have occurred and could continue to spread from a temporarily closed UST system. Although a holder
would not be required to comply with EPA's UST corrective action regulations if contamination is discovered (provided,
of course, the holder satisfies the requirements of this proposed rule), it would be required to report evidence of
the contamination to the implementing agency (as discussed in the following subsection), who can then decide on the
appropriate course of action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of course, a holder may choose to continue to operate the UST by storing or dispensing product after foreclosure, or
otherwise not exercise either of the options described above. The holder may determine that its interests will be
best served by forgoing the security interest exemption, continuing operation of the UST system, and perhaps realizing
a greater return of capital on the security interest by selling the property with the UST system as a going concern.
In such cases, the tank would be regulated in the same manner as a tank operated by any other person, and the holder would
be fully responsible as an operator for compliance with RCRA subtitle I regulations, including corrective action,
the UST technical standards, and financial responsibility requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the environment is adequately protected where a holder chooses either of the post-foreclosure
options described above for complying with the technical requirements of Subtitle I. Where the tank is removed from
service and emptied of its contents, the threat of an unknown or undetected leak resulting in environmental contamination
is abated; accordingly, the Agency believes it is appropriate to exempt a foreclosing holder from UST corrective
action regulatory requirements under these circumstances.

The Agency recognizes that some lenders may already hold UST properties through foreclosure or its equivalents at
the time the final rule is promulgated. Although EPA is primarily concerned about the future availability of capital
to UST owners and operators, rather than loans that have already been extended, the Agency recognizes that holders
may be concerned about their potential liability associated with current holdings acquired through foreclosure
or its equivalents affecting the extension of future UST loans. A holder who possesses an UST property at the time the
rule is promulgated may have tanks that still store product. It would be difficult to determine whether or not contamination
caused by a release from such tanks had occurred during the time that the holder had possession of the UST property.
A holder, therefore, could potentially be held liable as an UST operator if he has possession of a tank at the time the
final rule is promulgated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comments on this aspect of today's proposal. We are interested in collecting data that will clarify whether
future UST loan decisions would be negatively affected if the security interest exemption is not extended to holders
possessing UST properties through foreclosure or its equivalents upon promulgation of this rule. In addition, EPA
is interested in comments addressing whether and how an exemption from the UST regulatory requirements could be structured
for holders of such tanks. Finally, we are also interested in receiving comments addressing the extent to which such
a regulatory exemption could impact human health and the environment.

4. Release Reporting Requirements Following Foreclosure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under today's proposal, upon foreclosure, a holder taking advantage of the proposed exemption from corrective action
regulations must nevertheless comply with the requirement in &sect;280.50 that the discovery of any releases from
the UST be reported to the implementing agency. Only the reporting requirement must be followed; the holder need not
comply with &sect;280.52, despite the reference to that provision in &sect;280.50. The release reporting requirement
of &sect;280.50 is part of Subpart E, which details the obligations for reporting known or suspected releases, investigating
off-site impacts, confirming that a release has occurred, and cleaning up spills and overfills. While subpart E generally
implements Subtitle I's corrective action and site investigation requirements, from which a holder may be excluded
under today's proposed rule, &sect;280.50 has historically been viewed by EPA as part of the UST technical standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A holder is responsible, following foreclosure or its equivalents, for reporting to the implementing agency, any
discovery of released regulated substances, or any suspected release at an UST site or in the surrounding area. Such
reporting is considered necessary to ensure protection of human health and the environment. By informing the implementing
agency of a release, the implementing agency can then determine the appropriate response action, if any.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of today's proposed rule, a holder would have to perform release investigation and confirmation in
accordance with &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.53. Under today's proposal, a holder who chooses to take the tank(s)
out of service as described in this proposal is required to follow the procedures established in &sect;280.50 but
is not subject to the release investigation and confirmation requirements in &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.53.
A holder who elects to keep the tank(s) in operation is obligated to comply with all of the Subpart E requirements, including
those related to release investigation and confirmation, and corrective action.

E. Actions Taken to Protect Human Health and the Environment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the special position and role played by bona fide holders, as has been recognized by Congress in creating
the statutory exemption from corrective action liability, the Agency believes that it is appropriate to include
within the scope of protected UST or UST system activities certain lender actions which protect human health and the
environment. EPA believes that there are a number of activities in which a holder may engage after foreclosure which
can contribute to the protection of human health and the environment and in which the holder may engage and still meet
the terms of the proposed rule's exemption from regulatory requirements. Such activities include: Release response
and corrective action for UST systems, permanent or temporary closure of an UST or UST system, tank upgrades or replacements,
environmental investigations, maintenance of corrosion protection, and release reporting. The Agency believes
that protection of human health and the environment can be advanced by allowing a holder to participate in activities
associated with environmental compliance either prior to or following foreclosure on an UST or UST system. Environmental
compliance activities are generally considered to be integral to the daily operations of an UST or UST system, and
a person who participates in those activities would typically be considered an operator. However, a reasonable holder
may also undertake such activities in the course of maintaining its indicia of ownership in the tank to protect its
security interest. Therefore, the Agency believes that it is appropriate to propose that environmental compliance
activities, if undertaken by a holder, will nevertheless allow the holder to take advantage of the proposed exemption
from regulatory requirements. The Agency is not proposing that these activities be required of a holder as a condition
for obtaining the security interest exemption as an UST owner, but that holders be able to participate in these activities
without losing the protection of the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to foreclosure, therefore, and where the holder is otherwise permitted,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a holder may require the borrower to comply, or itself undertake to ensure compliance, with the subtitle I regulations
applicable to the tank owner and operator (typically, the borrower), without being deemed an ``operator'' under
the provisions of this proposed rule. EPA believes that a holder who is ensuring that a tank is operated as specified
in 40 CFR part 280 (even if the holder is itself performing the activities authorized or required by part 280) is acting
both to preserve the collateral (and therefore acting consistent with its capacity as a security interest holder)
and to protect human health and the environment. It is appropriate for a holder to intervene in such circumstances
in which human health and the environment are threatened by an UST owner or operator's improper management or operation
of its tank(s). However, undertaking activities that bring the tank(s) into compliance (i.e., regulatory compliance
actions such as tank testing, leak detection, upgrading, etc.) will not exempt a holder from complying with the UST
corrective action regulatory requirements if the holder is otherwise involved in the day-to-day operation of the
tank(s). All other acts of operation undertaken by a holder (such as filling the tank(s) with product, selling and/or
dispensing tank product, performing overall management functions, etc.) are not shielded activities under this
proposed rule because by doing so the holder displaces the borrower as the primary operator of the tank(s).

Furthermore, following foreclosure, where the holder chooses to take advantage of the conditional exemption from
the corrective action regulations by emptying and removing the tank from operation, as specified above, the Agency
proposes that the holder may_without losing the protection of the proposed rule_undertake cleanup activities consistent
with the corrective action requirements of 40 CFR part 280, subpart F at or in connection with the UST or UST system.
EPA specifically requests comments on this aspect of today's proposal.

IV. Financial Responsibility Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RCRA section 9003(d), as implemented by EPA at 40 CFR part 280, subpart H_Financial Responsibility, requires owners
or operators of petroleum USTs to demonstrate financial responsibility for taking corrective action and for compensating
third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental UST releases. As discussed earlier under
Section III. A of this proposal, EPA is defining, for purposes of its Subtitle I corrective action and technical requirements,
the term ``owner'' to mean that a holder who maintains ownership rights in an UST or UST system primarily to protect
a security interest does not rise to level of a full ``owner,'' and therefore is not subject to compliance with those
regulatory requirements. As described earlier, this proposed revision of EPA's corrective action regulatory program
is consistent with the Subtitle I statutory security interest exemption. Similarly, the Agency believes that a holder
is not subject to the financial responsibility requirements as an UST owner. The Agency is also proposing to exempt
a holder as an UST operator from the financial responsibility requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before a holder takes possession of an UST or UST system, a holder is not considered an UST operator, for purposes of
EPA's technical and financial responsibility regulations, if it is acting merely as a holder and is not in control
of the daily operation of the UST or UST system. Therefore, a holder typically is not subject to the UST financial responsibility
requirements of 40 CFR part 280, subpart H as an operator prior to foreclosure. EPA is today proposing that a holder
be exempted from corrective action as an operator after foreclosure if it ensures that its tanks no longer store petroleum
and it complies with the temporary or permanent closure requirements specified in this rule. (See Section III. D.
2 of this preamble). In these situations, where the tanks are empty and pose little threat of release, it would serve
no useful purpose to require a holder to demonstrate compliance with the financial responsibility requirements
for corrective action. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to exempt holders who satisfy all the other requirements
in this proposed rule from demonstrating Subtitle I financial responsibility for UST corrective action.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A holder's responsibility for demonstrating UST financial responsibility for third-party bodily injury and property
damage compensation poses a different issue. While RCRA Subtitle I does not include provisions that actually impose
third-party liability upon UST owners and operators, it does require UST owners and operators to demonstrate their
ability to compensate third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising
from the operation of an UST or UST system. The Agency believes that a holder who complies with all the conditions set
forth in today's proposal should not be required to comply with any of the UST financial responsibility requirements
as an owner or operator, including those for both corrective action and third-party liability coverage. EPA has chosen
to propose this exemption based on the statutory authority provided in section 9003. The proposed exemption is consistent
with the interpretation of that language adopted in the preamble to the UST financial responsibility final rule (53
FR 43323). In that rule, EPA exempted tanks taken out of operation prior to the effective date of the rule from UST financial
responsibility compliance. In the preamble to the final rule, EPA recognized that ``insurance providers would be
extremely reluctant to assure tanks taken out of operation because of the perceived greater uncertainty associated
with them'' (53 FR 43327). In particular, insurers have indicated that in the case of foreclosed USTs, they would be
concerned about vandalism and other threats to USTs at non-operational, unattended gas stations or similar locations
with public access. The preamble also states that ``even if providers of assurance would assure these tanks, it is
unlikely that they would cover leaks which occurred before the effective date of the policy'' (53 FR 43327). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A similar situation exists for holders who empty their tanks and enter temporary or permanent closure after foreclosure.
EPA has discovered that it is practically impossible to obtain third-party environmental insurance coverage for
a new owner of empty tanks. Providers of financial assurance are very reluctant to provide any coverage for tanks that
no longer store petroleum product. Further, providers are reluctant to provide coverage for damages that occur after
the effective date of the policy for releases that might have occurred prior to the effective date of the policy. Under
this proposed rule a holder is required to empty its tanks in order to be exempt from corrective action regulatory requirements.
Since providers are unlikely to provide any coverage for empty tanks at non-operational facilities or for releases
that occurred prior to foreclosure, and since third-party damages would be extremely unlikely to stem from releases
occurring after the holder forecloses on and empties its tanks, the Agency believes it is unnecessary to require third-party
liability coverage for such tanks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RCRA section 9003(c)(6) supports this proposed exemption. That provision emphasizes the connection between the
UST financial responsibility requirement and a tank's operational status: ``The regulations promulgated pursuant
to this section shall include:&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;(6) requirements for maintaining evidence of
financial responsibility for taking corrective action and compensating third parties for bodily injury and property
damage caused by sudden and nonsudden accidental releases arising from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
operating
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an underground storage tank.'' [emphasis added.] The Agency believes that since a holder must demonstrate that its
tanks are empty and that it is complying with the UST temporary or permanent closure requirements in order to avoid
corrective action liability as an operator, there should be no need for a holder who meets these requirements to demonstrate
financial responsibility for corrective action or third-party damages. By requiring the holder to empty the tank
in order to be exempt from corrective action requirements, EPA is ensuring that damages caused by future releases
from that tank will be minimized if not avoided altogether. As a result, EPA is proposing that holders who act in accordance
with the requirements described in this proposed rule be exempt from all subtitle I financial responsibility requirements.

V. State Program Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RCRA subtitle I section 9004, as implemented by 40 CFR part 281, provides states the ability to operate an UST regulatory
program in lieu of the federal program if they first submit the program for review and receive approval from EPA. EPA
approval of a state program means that the requirements in the state's laws and regulations will be in effect rather
than the federal requirements. Program approval ensures that a single set of requirements (the state's) will be enforced
in that state, thus eliminating the duplication and confusion that can result from having separate state and federal
requirements. EPA considers state program approval to be an integral part of the UST regulatory program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's approval review focuses primarily on the basic state authorities (laws and regulations) needed to achieve
the underlying objectives of the federal regulations covering the UST technical standards, corrective action,
and financial responsibility requirements. The UST state program approval process is also based upon a performance-oriented
approach. The statutory test for an approvable state program is that it be ``no less stringent'' than the federal requirements
and include as many categories of UST systems (or be as broad in scope) as the federal requirements. EPA reviews the
state's specific statutory and regulatory provisions as well as their interpretation by the attorney general of
the state. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed rule is not intended to present a barrier for states to receive state program approval. A state is
not required to have enacted a security interest exemption in order to receive approval of its program from EPA, since
failure to have such a provision would merely make the state program broader in scope than the federal one. However,
EPA encourages states to adopt statutory and/or regulatory provisions comparable to the final federal UST lender
liability rule so that credit-worthy UST owners and operators will have access to funds to upgrade or replace their
tanks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a state program includes an UST security interest exemption, EPA will evaluate it against the criteria in &sect;281.39,
as proposed in this notice. These criteria stem from the key components contained in this proposed rule. A state program
that exempts a holder from UST corrective action, financial responsibility, and technical requirements as an owner
may be approved if: The holder is maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest in a petroleum
UST or UST system; the holder does not participate in the management of the UST or UST system; and the holder does not
engage in petroleum production, refining, and marketing. In addition, a state program may be approved if it exempts
a holder from corrective action and financial responsibility as an operator and if, in addition to the three previous
criteria, it requires the holder to demonstrate that its tanks have been emptied and secured, and that it has either
permanently or temporarily closed the UST or UST system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The state's program application should address the issue of UST lender liability in the ``Scope'' section of its state
program description, under &sect;281.21(a)(3) of the State Program Approval regulations.

VI. Economic Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed elsewhere in this proposal, EPA believes that concerns over environmental liability are making a significant
number of lenders reluctant to make loans to otherwise credit-worthy owners and operators of USTs. A more analytical
approach to describing the current lending climate and the potential effects associated with today's proposal is
through a discussion of lending rates that UST owners are currently faced with, in comparison to those that may prevail
after promulgation of a final rule.

e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' that banks have to charge in order to be adequately compensated for their risk in an UST-related loan may often be
so high that it effectively precludes lenders from making loans at this level. A related barrier to lending is that
since all UST owners bear a systematic risk imposed by government regulations, lenders cannot diversify to substantially
reduce or eliminate the UST-related risk premium, r
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, by holding a portfolio of UST-related loans with different characteristics and risks. Since most UST owners and
operators are small businesses that cannot self finance, they will either forego or delay UST facility improvements.
While many UST-related loans are expected to be used for financing tank upgrades or replacements, these loans may
also be used to provide additional services at the facility (e.g., an expanded area for food items at a convenience
store). If lenders are precluded from making UST-related loans, both environmental protection and economic growth
may suffer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By providing the exemption for holders from UST regulatory requirements contained in this proposed rule and thus
reducing the uncertainty associated with making an UST-related loan, the risk premium is expected to be significantly
reduced. The interest rate relationship after final promulgation of today's proposed rule can be described as:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (post rule), that is both adequate to compensate lenders for their perceived risk and at the same time affordable for
credit-worthy UST owners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are social costs associated with owners' and operators' inability to use the least costly financial mechanism
to comply with the existing UST regulations. By reducing the risk premium to a level at which lenders are both willing
and able to make UST-related loans, this proposed regulation is expected to increase the ability of UST owners and
operators to comply with subtitle I regulations, thereby reducing these social costs. To the extent that loans are
made for environmental compliance purposes, social costs would also be reduced by decreasing the number and severity
of releases from old USTs that might otherwise occur in the absence of upgrading or replacing tanks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is interested in obtaining comments on how this proposed rule might allow UST owners and operators to use
less costly financial mechanisms to comply with UST regulations. Specifically, the Agency requests information
from lenders on the current interest rate charged for loans when property with one or more USTs is used as collateral.
The Agency also requests information from lenders regarding the extent to which credit might have been extended to
UST owners and operators in the past had this proposed rule been in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51,735 (October 4, 1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal
governments or communities;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this proposed rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because it raises policy issues. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response
to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, agencies must evaluate the effects of a regulation on small
entities. If the rule is likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' then a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis must be performed. Because this proposed rule may actually result in cost savings for small
entities that hold security interests in USTs or UST systems, EPA certifies that today's proposed rule would not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
participating in the management of an UST or UST system
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Actions that are participation in management pre-foreclosure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Participation in the management of an UST or UST system means, for purposes of this subpart, actual participation
in the management or control of decisionmaking related to the UST or UST system by the holder and does not include the
mere capacity or ability to influence or the unexercised right to control UST or UST system operations. A holder is
participating in management, while the borrower is still in possession of the UST or UST system encumbered by the security
interest, only if the holder either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Exercises decisionmaking control over the borrower's environmental compliance, such that the holder has undertaken
responsibility for the borrower's UST or UST system management; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Exercises control at a level comparable to that of a manager of the borrower's enterprise, such that the holder
has assumed or manifested responsibility for the overall management of the enterprise encompassing the day-to-day
decisionmaking of the enterprise with respect to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Environmental compliance; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) All, or substantially all, of the operational (as opposed to financial or administrative) aspects of the enterprise
other than environmental compliance. Operational aspects of the enterprise include functions such as that of facility
or plant manager, operations manager, chief operating officer, or chief executive officer. Financial or administrative
aspects include functions such as that of credit manager, accounts payable/receivable manager, personnel manager,
controller, chief financial officer, or similar functions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Actions at the inception of the loan or other transaction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No act or omission prior to the time that indicia of ownership are held primarily to protect a security interest constitutes
evidence of participation in management within the meaning of this Subpart. A prospective holder who undertakes
or requires an environmental investigation (which could include a site assessment, inspection, and/or audit) of
the UST or UST system in which indicia of ownership are to be held or requires a prospective borrower to clean up contamination
from the UST or UST system or to comply or come into compliance (whether prior or subsequent to the time that indicia
of ownership are held primarily to protect a security interest) with any applicable law or regulation is not by such
action considered to be participating in the UST's or UST system's management.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Loan policing and workout. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Actions that are consistent with holding ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest do not constitute
participation in management for purposes of this subpart. The authority for the holder to take such actions may, but
need not, be contained in contractual or other documents specifying requirements for financial, environmental,
and other warranties, covenants, conditions, representations or promises from the borrower. Loan policing and
workout activities cover and include all such activities up to foreclosure or its equivalents, exclusive of any activities
that constitute participation in management.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Policing the security interest or loan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A holder who engages in policing activities prior to foreclosure will remain within the exemption provided that the
holder does not by such actions participate in the management of the UST or UST system as provided in &sect;280.210(a).
Such actions include, but are not limited to, requiring the borrower to clean up contamination from the UST or UST system
during the term of the security interest; requiring the borrower to comply or come into compliance with applicable
federal, state, and local environmental and other laws, rules, and regulations during the term of the security interest;
securing or exercising authority to monitor or inspect the UST or UST system (including on-site inspections) in which
indicia of ownership are maintained, or the borrower's business or financial condition during the term of the security
interest; or taking other actions to adequately police the loan or security interest (such as requiring a borrower
to comply with any warranties, covenants, conditions, representations, or promises from the borrower). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Loan work out.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A holder who engages in work out activities prior to foreclosure or its equivalents will remain within the exemption
provided that the holder does not by such action participate in the management of the UST or UST system as provided in
&sect;280.210(a). For purposes of this rule, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
work out
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 refers to those actions by which a holder, at any time prior to foreclosure or its equivalents, seeks to prevent, cure,
or mitigate a default by the borrower or obligor; or to preserve, or prevent the diminution of, the value of the security.
Work out activities include, but are not limited to, restructuring or renegotiating the terms of the security interest;
requiring payment of additional rent or interest; exercising forbearance; requiring or exercising rights pursuant
to an assignment of accounts or other amounts owing to an obligor; requiring or exercising rights pursuant to an escrow
agreement pertaining to amounts owing to an obligor; providing specific or general financial or other advice, suggestions,
counseling, or guidance; and exercising any right or remedy the holder is entitled to by law or under any warranties,
covenants, conditions, representations, or promises from the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Foreclosure on an UST or UST system and participation in management activities post-foreclosure_(1) Foreclosure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Indicia of ownership that are held primarily to protect a security interest include legal or equitable title acquired
through or incident to foreclosure or its equivalents. For purposes of this subpart, the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
foreclosure or its equivalents
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 includes purchase at foreclosure sale; acquisition or assignment of title in lieu of foreclosure; termination of
a lease or other repossession; acquisition of a right to title or possession; an agreement in satisfaction of the obligation;
or any other formal or informal manner (whether pursuant to law or under warranties, covenants, conditions, representations,
or promises from the borrower) by which the holder acquires title to or possession of the secured UST or UST system.
The indicia of ownership held after foreclosure continue to be maintained primarily as protection for a security
interest provided that the holder undertakes to sell, re-lease an UST or UST system held pursuant to a lease financing
transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), or otherwise divest itself
of the UST or UST system in a reasonably expeditious manner, using whatever commercially reasonable means are relevant
or appropriate with respect to the UST or UST system, taking all facts and circumstances into consideration, and provided
that the holder did not participate in management (as defined in &sect;280.210(a)) prior to foreclosure or its equivalents.
For purposes of establishing that a holder is seeking to sell, re-lease an UST or UST system held pursuant to a lease
financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), or divest an
UST or UST system in a reasonably expeditious manner, the holder may use whatever commercially reasonable means as
are relevant or appropriate with respect to the UST or UST system, or may employ the means specified in &sect;280.210(c)(2).
A holder that outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon a written 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 firm offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system, as provided in &sect;280.210(c)(2), is not considered
to hold indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Holding foreclosed property for disposition and liquidation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A holder, who did not participate in management prior to foreclosure or its equivalents, may sell, re-lease an UST
or UST system held pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution
of the lessee), liquidate, wind up operations, and take measures to preserve, protect, or prepare the secured UST
or UST system prior to sale or other disposition. The holder may conduct these activities without voiding the exemption,
subject to the requirements of this subpart.

(i) A holder establishes that the ownership indicia maintained following foreclosure or its equivalents continue
to be held primarily to protect a security interest by, within 12 months following foreclosure, listing the UST or
UST system or the facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, with a broker, dealer, or agent who deals
with the type of property in question, or by advertising the UST or UST system as being for sale or disposition on at least
a monthly basis in either a real estate publication or a trade or other publication suitable for the UST or UST system
in question, or a newspaper of general circulation (defined as one with a circulation over 10,000, or one suitable
under any applicable federal, state, or local rules of court for publication required by court order or rules of civil
procedure) covering the area where the UST or UST system is located. For purposes of this provision, the 12-month period
begins to run from the time that the holder acquires marketable title, provided that the holder, after the expiration
of any redemption or other waiting period provided by law, was acting diligently to acquire marketable title. If the
holder fails to act diligently to acquire marketable title, the 12-month period begins to run on the date of foreclosure
or its equivalents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A holder that outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon an offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system or the
facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located establishes by such outbidding, rejection, or failure
to act, that the ownership indicia in the secured UST or UST system are not held primarily to protect the security interest,
unless the holder is required, in order to avoid liability under federal or state law, to make a higher bid, to obtain
a higher offer, or to seek or obtain an offer in a different manner.

Fair consideration, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in the case of a holder maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a senior security interest in the UST
or UST system, is the value of the security interest as defined in this section. The value of the security interest is
calculated as an amount equal to or in excess of the sum of the outstanding principal (or comparable amount in the case
of a lease that constitutes a security interest) owed to the holder immediately preceding the acquisition of full
title (or possession in the case of an UST or UST system subject to a lease financing transaction) pursuant to foreclosure
or its equivalents, plus any unpaid interest, rent, or penalties (whether arising before or after foreclosure or
its equivalents), plus all reasonable and necessary costs, fees, or other charges incurred by the holder incident
to work out, foreclosure or its equivalents, retention, preserving, protecting, and preparing the UST or UST system
prior to sale, re-lease of an UST or UST system held pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease
financing transaction or substitution of the lessee) or other disposition, plus environmental investigation and
corrective action costs incurred under &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.67; less any amounts received by the holder
in connection with any partial disposition of the property and any amounts paid by the borrower subsequent to the acquisition
of full title (or possession in the case of an UST or UST system subject to a lease financing transaction) pursuant to
foreclosure or its equivalents. In the case of a holder maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a junior
security interest, fair consideration is the value of all outstanding higher priority security interests plus the
value of the security interest held by the junior holder, each calculated as set forth in the preceding sentence.

firm offer'' means a legally enforceable, commercially reasonable, cash offer solely for the foreclosed UST or UST
system, including all material terms of the transaction, from a ready, willing, and able purchaser who demonstrates
to the holder's satisfaction the ability to perform. For purposes of this provision, the six-month period begins
to run from the time that the holder acquires marketable title, provided that the holder, after the expiration of any
redemption or other waiting period provided by law, was acting diligently to acquire marketable title. If the holder
fails to act diligently to acquire marketable title, the six-month period begins to run on the date of foreclosure
or its equivalents.

(a) A state is not required to have a security interest exemption to obtain or maintain RCRA Subtitle I program approval.
If a state enacts a security interest exemption provision, it does not have to be as extensive as the security interest
exemption provided for in 40 CFR part 280, subpart I, as defined in &sect;&sect;280.200 through 280.250, to obtain
or maintain RCRA subtitle I program approval. However, a state's security interest exemption cannot be broader in
scope or less stringent than the security interest exemption provided for in 40 CFR part 280, subpart I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A state program will be considered to be no less stringent than, and as broad in scope as, the federal program provided
that the state provision:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Achieves the same effect as provided by the following key criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A holder, meaning a person who maintains indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest in a petroleum
UST or UST system, who does not participate in the management of the UST or UST system as defined under &sect;280.210
and who does not engage in petroleum production, refining, and marketing as defined under &sect;280.200(a) is not:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) An ``owner'' of a petroleum UST or UST system for purposes of compliance with 40 CFR part 280 requirements;
