SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In keeping with the Administration's initiative to reinvent Government, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
is issuing proposed regulations to improve the administrative process used by the Federal Employees' Group Life
Insurance (FEGLI) and Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) programs in resolving disputes between Federal
employees and agencies over coverage and enrollment issues. The purpose of the proposed regulations is to improve
the performance of the Government by delegating to Federal agencies the authority to reconsider disputes over coverage
and enrollment issues in these two programs and to make retroactive as well as prospective corrections of errors.
The proposed regulations would result in more efficient Government operations and improved service to individuals
seeking benefits under the programs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the FEGLI law, eligible employees are automatically insured under Basic Life insurance (generally equal to
their annual pay, rounded to the next thousand, plus $2,000), unless they waive coverage. In addition, employees
with Basic Life coverage may elect coverage under one or more of the 3 types of optional insurance available. (Standard
Optional offers an additional $10,000 of insurance. Additional Optional offers insurance in an amount of one, two,
three, four, or five times annual pay rounded to the next thousand. Family Optional offers $5,000 insurance for the
spouse and $2,500 for each child.) OPM's regulations prescribe the circumstances under which employees cancel waivers
of Basic Life, elect optional coverage, increase optional coverage, or drop coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the FEHB Program, eligible employees may enroll in FEHB when they are first hired. They may enroll or change enrollment
during open season, when their family status changes, or at other times prescribed by OPM's regulations. The FEHB
law also provides for enrollment by certain former employees, former spouses, and children when they lose regular
FEHB coverage because of separation from service or loss of family member status. The specific conditions of their
enrollment and opportunities to change enrollment are controlled by OPM's regulations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Employees (and family members who are eligible to enroll in FEHB) make changes in their life insurance coverage and
health benefits enrollment through the employee's personnel office. These administrative actions are normally
conducted entirely between the agency and the individual, based on FEGLI and FEHB law and regulations. However, occasions
arise when individuals challenge the agency's denial of their request for coverage, to change their FEHB enrollment
or FEGLI coverage, or to change their FEGB enrollment or FEGLI optional coverage retroactively. (Because Basic Life
insurance coverage is mandatory under FEGLI law unless the employee waives it, an agency that erroneously denies
Basic Life to an employee must restore it retroactively when the error is discovered.) Under OPM's regulations, elections
of optional life insurance coverage and FEHB enrollment or enrollment changes are generally effective prospectively
unless a specific statutory or regulatory provision requires or allows the agency to make a retroactive change. Errors
that consist of allowing an employee to elect life insurance coverage under circumstances not prescribed by law or
regulation are corrected retroactively, including errors that are not discovered until after the death of an insured
employee.) The current process used to resolve disputes between individuals and agencies over coverage or enrollment
determinations is described in 5 CFR &sect;&sect;870.205, 871.206, 872.206, 873.206, 874.305, and 890.104. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these current procedures, employees, children, or former spouses who are denied coverage or enrollment, the
opportunity to change coverage or enrollment, or, in most cases, to have a change made retroactively by a Federal agency
must write to the Office of Personnel Management within 30 days after the agency's written denial if they believe the
agency's decision was incorrect and want to have it reviewed. OPM reviews the agency's denial to determine if it complies
with the applicable law and regulations. Since agencies currently do not have the regulatory authority to make retroactive
changes in most cases, they must deny most such requests. Therefore, most requests for a retroactive change must come
to OPM for review before the retroactive change can be made. (Basic life insurance is an exception. Under the FEGLI
law, employees are automatically covered for Basic Life insurance; therefore, agencies must correct failures to
withhold retroactively.) In addition, OPM has the authority, by regulation, to order corrections of errors, mistakes,
or omissions based on its determination that it would be against equity and good conscience not to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, OPM received 283 requests for reconsideration and upheld the agency's decision in 39 percent of the cases.
OPM overturned 38 percent of agency decisions and returned 23 percent to the agency because the individual failed
to follow proper administrative procedures. As of August 30, 1993, there has been a 50 percent increase in requests
for reconsideration over the 1992 figures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many of these cases, the issue was (or included) a request that the coverage or change in coverage be made retroactive
to some earlier date. Out of 94 requests from employees involving retroactive coverage, we allowed 70 and denied 24.
Although an agency has all the necessary information at its disposal and knows whether a retroactive correction is
appropriate, it lacks the authority under current regulations to make corrections retroactively. It can accept
the employee's request to enroll or change enrollment, but only on a prospective basis. The agency must deny the employee's
request for a retroactive change. Therefore, the employees write to OPM to have the decision reviewed. If appropriate,
OPM can then order the agency to make the retroactive correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of OPM's ongoing efforts to improve efficiency, and in keeping with the Administration's initiative to streamline
Government operations, OPM is issuing proposed regulations that would delegate to Federal agencies the authority
to correct coverage and enrollment errors retroactively. In addition, the proposed regulations would transfer
the reconsideration (review) process for the FEGLI and FEHB programs from OPM to the agencies. Under the proposed
regulations, Federal agencies (or retirement systems, if applicable) would make the initial decisions at the employing
office level and would provide for reconsideration at a higher, or otherwise independent, level of review. The reconsideration
could, at each agency's discretion, be made at a higher level within the employing office or at the same level elsewhere
in the agency. The proposed regulations set forth only the most basic elements necessary to meet due process requirements.
For the most part, agencies would be free to use existing administrative review procedures that include these basic
elements or to create administrative procedures specific to this purpose. The agency's decision based on its reconsideration
of the initial decision would be final. (FEGLI and FEHB decisions are not appealable to the Merit Systems Protection
Board.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations regarding employee withholdings and Government contributions would continue to apply. That
is, when agencies make retroactive changes, the agency must pay into the respective trust fund an amount equal to any
withholdings and contributions due from the effective date of the change. The agency may collect the amount of the
withholdings due from the employee or may waive collection under existing law and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the authority to make retroactive changes conferred by the proposed regulations, the agencies could correct
errors promptly, review initial decisions on request, and give the individual a thorough, written explanation of
the final decision. Thus, we believe that the Government would operate more efficiently and employees, their children,
and their former spouses would be better served under these regulations.

An employing office's decision for an individual is considered an initial decision as used in paragraph (a) of this

by the agency or retirement system. However, an initial decision rendered at the highest level of review available

that he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was prevented by circumstances
beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit. An agency or retirement system decision in
response to a request for reconsideration of an employing office's decision is a final decision as described in paragraph

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would amend the Egg Research and Promotion Order to increase the assessment rate from 5 cents to
10 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs. The increase is authorized by amendments to the Egg Research and Consumer
Information Act must be approved by egg producers voting in a referendum. This proposal would also make a conforming
amendment to regulations.

Executive Orders 12866 and 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule has been determined not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and has been reviewed by the
Office of Management and Budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
14 of the Act, a person subject to an order may file a petition with the Secretary stating that such order, any provisions
of such order or any obligations imposed in connection with such order are not in accordance with law; and requesting
a modification of the order or an exemption therefrom. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the
petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the
United States in any district in which such person is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, has jurisdiction
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint is filed within 20 days after date of the entry of the
ruling.

Effect on Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, 618 egg producers pay assessments to the American Egg Board (AEB). A proposed rule to increase the exemption
level from 30,000 to 75,000 laying hens was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 22, 1994 (59 FR 13460). The increased exemption level would exempt 253 small egg producers who represent 41
percent of the egg producers currently paying assessments, but only 4 percent of AEB's total assessment income. It
is anticipated that the 75,000-hen exemption level would be in place before the referendum on the assessment rate
increase. Therefore, a change in the assessment rate would affect only egg producers owning more than 75,000 laying
hens.

There are an estimated 365 producers who own more than 75,000 hens. Currently, egg producers must pay a mandatory assessment
of 5 cents per 30-dozen case of eggs marketed to fund the research and promotion activities authorized by the Act. The
present 5-cent assessment is equivalent to approximately 0.231 percent of the wholesale price of a 1-dozen carton
of Large eggs. An assessment rate of 10 cents per 30-dozen case would be equivalent to approximately 0.463 percent
of the wholesale price of a
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1-dozen carton of Large eggs. This is based on the Economic Research Service's 3-year average wholesale price for
New York City Grade A Large cartoned eggs (1991&hyph;93) of 72 cents per dozen. AEB collects approximately $7.5 million
annually from the 5-cent assessment, and it is estimated that it would collect $14 million for a 10-cent assessment.
It is estimated that any additional costs would be offset by the benefits to be derived from strengthened research
and promotion programs.

Background and Proposed Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 14, 1993, the Egg Research and Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C. 2711) was amended (Pub. L. 103&hyph;188)
to increase the maximum rate of assessment, raise the exemption level, and provide for research project funding.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the amended section 8 of the Act, the maximum rate of assessment was raised from 10 cents to 20 cents per case of
commercial eggs. The actual assessment rate is prescribed by the Egg Research and Promotion Order and is currently
5 cents per case. Producers owning 30,000 or fewer laying hens are exempt from paying assessments and other provisions
of the Act. Section 12 of the Act was amended to increase the exemption level to 75,000 or fewer hens. A proposed rule
to raise the exemption level in the Order was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 22, 1994. The new exemption level will become effective after publication of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act amendments provide that AEB may recommend an increase in the assessment rate to the Secretary. The recommendation
must be based on a scientific study, marketing analysis, or other evidence demonstrating a need for the increase.
Consequently, AEB conducted a marketing analysis and evaluated the advertising and nutrition research programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Advertising
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AEB began its first advertising campaign in 1977. For the next 3 years, media expenditures averaged $3.5 million annually.
In 1980, the American Association of Advertising Agencies noted that, during that 3-year period, per capita consumption
of eggs had increased and consumer attitudes toward eggs had improved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering inflation, an estimated $9 million would be required for AEB to conduct a media program in 1994 comparable
to that in 1977. Further, because consumers have grown more concerned with a variety of issues affecting egg consumption,
an even greater level of funding would be needed to achieve the same results today.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AEB's analysis establishes that egg consumption has been steadily declining over many years. In fact, USDA statistics
show that per capita consumption dropped from 402 in 1945 to 234 in 1993. In general, the decline is attributed to fewer
egg-consuming households and less frequent egg consumption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eggs face certain barriers in the marketplace which have contributed to the declining consumption. Considered by
consumers to be primarily a breakfast food, eggs must compete with a variety of breakfast alternatives: cold cereal;
pancakes and waffles; rolls, muffins, and toast; and hot cereal. The total measured media spending for the breakfast
food category was $937 million in 1993. Egg industry advertising-including that funded by AEB, State and regional
associations, and companies promoting name brands-represents only 0.7 percent of that amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, consumer concerns with fat and cholesterol have significantly affected consumer eating habits. The
judgment that eggs are high in cholesterol has further contributed to consumers using fewer eggs. Overcoming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative consumer attitudes is even more difficult when other breakfast foods are more heavily promoted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AEB's current advertising strategy is three-fold: (1) Educate consumers about eggs and cholesterol by providing
facts on egg cholesterol in a healthy diet; (2) remind consumers how much they love the great taste of eggs; and (3) connect
eggs with the rich, pleasurable associations people have with eggs and egg-eating occasions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current ``I Love Eggs'' advertising campaign based on this strategy proved effective in consumer testing. Prior
to being exposed to the advertising, 43 percent of consumers tested had extremely positive or very positive attitudes
about eggs. This number increased by 13 percent after consumers were exposed to the advertising. Further, almost
half of the consumers tested reported an increased likelihood of eating and serving eggs more often.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With current funding, AEB has earmarked about $2.8 million for this campaign in 1995. This budget supports 15-second
television commercials and 30-second radio spots. A 5-cent increase in the assessment rate would allow for an advertising
budget of $7.5 million. This budget would enable the use of more effective 30-second television spots; allow advertising
to be aired almost every other week, as opposed to the 10 weeks per year now; and provide for over 1,000 additional commercial
announcements. Most significantly, an additional one million target households would be reached by AEB advertising
each week.

Nutrition Research
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The nutrition portion of AEB's budget encompasses two programs of importance both for the egg industry and the consuming
public-nutrition research and nutrition education.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years, an increased amount of the AEB budget has been used for research to evaluate the effects of dietary
cholesterol on plasma lipids. Since 1991, $1.3 million has funded research projects at various universities, all
of which have focused on this issue. For example, a recently completed study was published in the April issue of the
American Heart Association's ``Arteriosclerosis and Thrombosis'' journal. The results of this study found that
blood cholesterol levels in young healthy men did not significantly increase when they were fed 1 or 2 eggs per day.
Additional funding would allow the egg industry to study the same effects across other population groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increased funding also would allow AEB to expand its contacts with scientists, health professionals, and the media
in developing nutrition materials, sponsoring scientific symposiums and related forums, and compiling research
data.

AEB Recommendation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the March 17, 1994, Board meeting in Chicago, Illinois, AEB members voted unanimously to recommend that the assessment
rate be increased from 5 cents to 10 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs. Their decision was based on the marketing
analysis as well as an overall sense from producers nationwide that more funds are necessary to help improve the position
of the industry's products in the marketplace through strengthened advertising and research programs. AEB further
requested that a referendum on this increase be held as soon as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Referendum
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After an opportunity for public comment, a referendum will be held among egg producers not exempt from the Act. Producers
engaged in the production of commercial eggs during a representative period determined by the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be eligible to vote on the assessment rate change proposed by AEB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All known eligible egg producers will receive information in the mail regarding the referendum. It is anticipated
that the 75,000-hen exemption level will be in place before the referendum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in the assessment rate shall become effective if the change is approved or favored by not less than two-thirds
of the producers voting in the referendum, or a majority of such producers if they represent not less than two-thirds
of the commercial eggs produced by those voting.

The Commission is seeking public comment on a proposed amendment to its Commentary on the Fair Credit Reporting Act
(``FCRA''), 16 CFR Part 600. The proposed amendment clarifies the Commission's interpretation that the FCRA requires
the disclosure of ``risk scores'' to consumers by consumer reporting agencies. This action responds to widespread
interest in this issue, and various inquiries the Commission and its staff have received about it.

During the late 1980s, the credit reporting industry developed a product, called the ``risk score,'' to evaluate
a consumer's credit history for its clients. A risk score assesses the likelihood of a particular adverse event, such
as default or bankruptcy, based on various factors in a consumer report. The result of this evaluation is communicated
by means of a numerical score.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 609 of the FCRA requires a consumer reporting agency, upon receiving a request and proper identification
from a consumer, to ``clearly and accurately disclose to the consumer .&blank;.&blank;. [t]he nature and substance
of all information (except medical information) in its files on the consumer at the time of the request.'' A consumer
reporting agency also must disclose, in most instances, the sources of the information in the consumer's file, as
well as the recipients of any consumer report on the consumer which the reporting agency has furnished six months preceding
the consumer's request (or two years, if the report is for employment purposes).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 11, 1992, the Commission amended its FCRA Commentary to state that, pursuant to section 609 of the FCRA,
``a risk score (or other numerical evaluation, however named) that is reported by a consumer reporting agency to a
client to assist in evaluating a consumer's eligibility for credit (or other permissible purposes) must be disclosed
(along with an explanation of the risk score)'' to a consumer requesting disclosure of his or her credit file from the
consumer reporting agency. 57 FR 4935&hyph;36 (Feb. 11, 1992). It noted that Congresswoman Leonor Sullivan, when
introducing the conference report on the bill that ultimately enacted the FCRA, had stated:

(The House conferees) stressed that the consumer should have access to all information 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
in any form which would be relayed to a prospective employer, insurer or creditor in making a judgment as to the worthiness
of the individual's application for such benefits.*&blank;*&blank;* It is not intended that the credit reporting
firm should have a free hand in excluding from the consumer's access information other than medical information it
just does not want to give him, but will give to a client-user.

After the Commission amended the FCRA Commentary, several industry representatives requested clarification of
the revision. As part of this process, some of these parties (as well as consumer representatives and other interested
parties) submitted informal statements of their positions that appear on the Commission's public record. Commissioners
and Bureau of Consumer Protection staff have discussed these issues with industry, consumer and state representatives.
During these discussions, the following three principal issues arose concerning the applicability of the FCRA to
risk scores: (1) When a consumer reporting agency must disclose a risk score; (2) what score(s) must be disclosed;
and (3) what type of explanation of the score, if any, must be provided as part of the disclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these inquiries, the Commission proposes to expand the discussion of risk scores in the FCRA Commentary
as set forth below.

12. Risk scores. A consumer reporting agency must disclose to a consumer in response to a consumer's disclosure request:
(a) risk scores (or other numerical evaluations, however named), calculated at the time of the consumer's request;
and (b) a brief statement that explains what the risk score predicts, how the score may be applied by its user, and how
the consumer ranks against other consumers under the scoring model. The agency must disclose this information for
each type of score, regardless of who developed the score, that the agency has reported to its clients within the six
months preceding the date of the consumer's disclosure request (or within two years, if for employment purposes).

useful. The Commission specifically requests comments based on reasoned analysis of provisions of the FCRA that
discuss the impact of the proposal on consumers and the marketplace.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) What type of risk score disclosure is mandated under section 609 of the FCRA? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Consumer reporting agencies generally calculate risk scores only when they receive a request for such a score
from a client. Is a consumer entitled to a risk score disclosure if the consumer reporting agency has never reported
a score on that individual? Assuming some prior risk score report is necessary to trigger the disclosure requirement,
does a risk score provided by a consumer reporting agency only in the context of ``prescreening'' provide an appropriate
trigger? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If provision of a risk score to a client is an appropriate trigger for the disclosure requirement, in what time frame,
if any, must that score have been provided? Are each of the proposed time frames, which are based on sections 609(a)(3)
and 611(d) of the FCRA, proper and sensible? Are they unduly burdensome on credit bureaus or insufficient to provide
adequate disclosure to consumers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Risk scoring systems can be created by or for consumer reporting agencies themselves (``generic models''), or
they can be created by or for one or more of the agency's clients (``custom models''). Should the disclosure requirement
for risk scores based on generic models and custom models be the same? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Credit files are constantly changing. New items are added while older items become statutorily obsolete and are
dropped. Because of the dynamic nature of consumer reports, the risk score that is reported to a creditor at any given
time may differ from the score that would be assigned to that report at a time shortly thereafter. Should ``historical''
risk scores (those actually provided to the agency's clients) or ``current'' risk scores (calculated at the time
of the disclosure) be disclosed to consumers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A consumer reporting agency may produce a variety of different risk scores, such as a bankruptcy risk score, a default
risk score, or other types of scores. Should the consumer reporting agency be required to disclose to consumers each
type of risk score it offers its clients the option of purchasing, or only those scores that have actually been provided
about that consumer to one or more clients? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) What explanation, if any, should a consumer reporting agency provide consumers about their risk scores? Should
agencies discuss how the score may be used by their clients? Should agencies specify how the individual consumer ranks
in regard to others? If so, should the ranking be done by percentile or other technique? Should the Commentary specify
the precise form of explanation, or contain expanded requirements as to the details of the explanation? Is the proposal
to require an explanation of the risk score too narrow or too broad? If so, in what way should it be expanded or contracted?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Is there some approach other than disclosure of actual risk scores that would better inform consumers of the information
about them being reported by consumer reporting agencies? For example, might it be more useful for a consumer reporting
agency to provide a single score to all consumers designed to show the likelihood of obtaining credit? Would it be more
helpful for the consumer to receive a list of the elements on which the calculation of such a ``score'' is based, rather
than the actual score and explanation required by the proposal?

A consumer reporting agency is not required to disclose information consisting of an audit trail of changes it makes
in the consumer's file, billing records, or the contents of a consumer relations folder, if the information is not
from consumer reports and will not be used in preparing future consumer reports. Such data is not included in the term
``information in the files'' which must be disclosed to the consumer pursuant to this section. A consumer reporting
agency must disclose claims report information only if it has appeared in consumer reports.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A consumer reporting agency must disclose to a consumer in response to a consumer's disclosure request: (a) Risk scores
(or other numerical evaluations, however named), calculated at the time of the consumer's request; and (b) a brief
statement that explains what the risk score predicts, how the score may be applied by its user, and how the consumer
ranks against other consumers under the scoring model. The agency must disclose this information for each type of
score, regardless of who developed the score, that the agency has reported to its clients within the six months preceding
the date of the consumer's disclosure request (or within two years, if for employment purposes).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document withdraws the proposed amendment to the Customs Regulations, which would have permitted drawback
claimants to file only one application for use of the exporter's summary procedure, instead of filing separate applications
for the use of the procedure for each Customs region or district in which they file drawback claims. Customs has determined
that any amendment of the exporter's summary procedure, including any necessary provisions to ensure uniformity
in approving or revoking the use of this procedure, would more appropriately be considered in concert with the broad-based
review and revision of the drawback regulations necessitated by, and which will shortly be undertaken pursuant to,
the Customs modernization portion of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Drawback is a refund or remission, in whole or in part, of a Customs duty, internal revenue tax, or fee. There are a number
of different kinds of drawback authorized under law. In order to qualify for drawback, there must be an exportation
or a destruction under Customs supervision. The statute providing for specific types of drawback is 19 U.S.C. 1313.
The Customs Regulations implementing the statute are contained in 19 CFR part 191. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements for establishing the exportation of goods subject to drawback are set forth in subpart E of part 191.
This subpart authorizes the use of several alternative procedures to establish exportation. One of these is the exporter's
summary procedure, which is provided for in &sect;191.53. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the exporter's summary procedure, the claimant is allowed to establish exportation for drawback simply by
summarizing his exports in chronological order, along with certain associated data, using a format acceptable to
the appropriate regional commissioner or district director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A drawback claimant wishing to use the exporter's summary procedure must first make application with each regional
commissioner, or, if applicable, with each district director, in whose region or district drawback will be sought.
The regional commissioner or the district director, if applicable, would approve the request, if it is determined
that the use of the procedure would contribute to administrative efficiency, and the claimant is not otherwise delinquent
or remiss in transactions with Customs. This can result in excessive paperwork. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, by a document published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 10, 1992 (57 FR 41446), Customs proposed to amend paragraph (c) of &sect;191.53 so that drawback claimants
would not have to file separate applications to use the exporter's summary procedure in each region or district where
they file drawback claims. Approval, denial, or revocation of a claimant's use of the procedure in one region or district
would govern the claimant's eligibility in all regions and districts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While three commenters responded to the notice of proposed rulemaking, all generally favoring adoption of the proposal,
the concern was expressed that there was a lack of uniformity among the various regions and districts in processing
applications to use the exporter's summary procedure. This problem was not resolved or addressed by the regulation
in question.

Withdrawal of Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In consideration of the foregoing, and, moreover, in view of the extensive drawback regulation changes necessitated
by the Customs modernization portion of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act (Pub.
L. 103&hyph;182, &sect;632), Customs has now determined that any amendment of the exporter's summary procedure,
including any necessary provisions to ensure 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uniformity in approving or revoking the use of this procedure, would more properly be considered in concert with the
broad-based review and revision of the drawback regulations which will be shortly undertaken pursuant to the Customs
modernization portion of the NAFTA Implementation Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under 39 U.S.C. 401(4), the Postal Service has the general power to determine and keep its own system of accounts and
the forms and contents of its contracts and other business documents. In the past, for freight invoicing purposes,
the Postal Service has generally used Government Bills of Lading, Standard Form 1103 (SF 1103), in accordance with
the procedures set forth in 41 CFR 101&hyph;41.000, et seq. The Postal Service is considering changes to its payment
system that would affect invoicing procedures for all freight transportation carriers currently handling shipments
on Government Bills of Lading. Shipments of U.S. Mail, household goods, or other personal property not handled on
SF 1103 would not be covered by the new payment system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This change would permit the Postal Service to implement new software applications for freight traffic management.
The principal feature of the new system would be to permit freight carriers to submit billings either electronically,
or by paper invoices using the Public Voucher, Standard Form 1113 (SF 1113), along with the required supporting documentation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New billing procedures would be drafted to provide guidance both for electronic and paper billing. These procedures
would include information about the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) approval process, Trading Partner Agreements,
submission of electronic invoices, testing rejection and resubmission of valid invoices, payments, and suspension
of EDI operations. Information about waivers, payee codes, and other payment processes would also be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service believes that freight carriers electing to conduct business electronically should be required
to use the EDI Standards X12, developed by the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) of the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI). The Postal Service would obtain commercial EDI Value-Added Network (VAN) services to send and
receive EDI shipping and billing data. Carriers would be required to use the VAN selected by the Postal Service to transfer
data electronically for these transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although existing procedures for issuing and paying Government Bills of Lading for Postal Service shipments will
continue, one change would be required to be consistent with electronic practices, if they are implemented. Any carrier
submitting paper billings would be required to include its Tax Identification Number (TIN) on the SF 1113. A TIN for
a parent company would also be required if the carrier is a subsidiary of a parent company. The carrier TIN would be used
for vendor identification during payment processing; the Postal Service would not assign its own vendor supplier
code for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the foregoing, the Postal Service requests comments and proposals from interested parties on the following
matters: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The level of carrier interest in electronic communications to replace hardcopy bills of lading and freight bills.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Postal Service proposes changes to several Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards defining a mailpiece's length,
height, and thickness, and relating these dimensions to processing category and other criteria. The Postal Service
also proposes changes to other DMM standards concerning the content and placement of delivery and return addresses,
including placement standards for delivery addresses on flat-size mailpieces not prepared in a full enclosure,
and letter- and flat-size pieces prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper; the location of, and the use
of a ZIP Code or ZIP+4 code in, the return address on certain mail; terms related to post office boxes and standards for
their use in addressing mail; and the prohibition of dual addresses on certain types of mail.

Revisions Concerning Physical Mailpiece Dimensions and Address Placement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revisions to C010 and C050 (with lesser changes to A010, A200, and E312) concern how the physical characteristics
of a mailpiece are used in determining which dimensions are its length, height, and thickness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information is used to determine correct address placement and the mailpiece's mailability, susceptibility
to a nonstandard surcharge, processing category, and rate eligibility. This proposal will apply a consistent definition
of length, height, and thickness to all mail, except for pieces eligible for and claimed at a Barcoded rate for flats.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this proposal affects all addressed mail, its impact will be on address placement on letter-size pieces
(including, for purposes of these standards, cards), which are subject to standards for address placement and orientation
and rate eligibility based on those characteristics. The Postal Service proposes to make the following specific
changes to the DMM: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A010.1.0 is amended to standardize address placement on all letter-size mail claimed at other than a single-piece
rate (or, for pieces within a small dimensional range, at the Barcoded rate for flats) to require that the address be
oriented parallel to the length of the piece (as defined in revised C010.1.1). Letter-size mail, which represents
the majority of postal volume, is processed in a mostly automated or mechanized mailstream. An increasing proportion
of letter-size mail (already subject to strict physical standards) moves through automated equipment, and most
of the remainder is handled by letter-sorting machines. Manual processing_the slowest and most costly handling_is
used for mail having physical or address characteristics that are incompatible with automated or mechanized processing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Postal Service recognizes that some mail may never be compatible with its equipment, it believes that
such compatibility is a reasonable condition for mail being claimed at a discounted rate. Whether to render a mailpiece
compatible with automation (as under existing standards), mechanization, or human handling, the benefit of the
proposed rule is clear. Certain necessary, basic assumptions about how mail is oriented when its address is to be read
underlie how equipment is designed to receive and move mail and how employees are trained to read, sort, and carry it.
Most letter-size mail has address and dimensional characteristics that are compatible with these assumptions,
but the absence of effective standards allows incompatible mail to enjoy discounts that are incongruous with how
it must be processed. (Nonstandard surcharges do not apply to all such mail.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the sake of creativity, some customers currently generate mail at bulk or presort rates that must be held vertically
(``portrait'' style) rather than horizontally (``landscape'' style) to read the delivery address. Such mailpieces
must be processed manually because they are incompatible with Postal Service automation and mechanized letter-sorting
machines. These pieces cause problems even for the letter carrier, who must turn them to sort and again to deliver.
The Postal Service acknowledges that this proposal will inhibit such mailpiece design practices. However, the benefit
of facilitating efficient processing_for cost and for service_outweighs the minor loss of creative latitude that
will result if the proposed rule is adopted. (Mailers to whom this creative latitude is truly significant will have
the option of mailing pieces at single-piece rates.) However, given the relative proportion of the mailstream represented
by incompatible bulk or presort rate letter-size mail, compared with the volume that is compatible, the Postal Service
believes that few mailers will be impacted by the effects on mailpiece design of the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A010.1.0 and A200.1.3 are revised to add mandatory address placement standards for other-than-single-piece
rate flat-size mail prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper, or otherwise not prepared in an envelope,
polybag, or similar enclosure. The types of mail affected by this standard are relatively difficult and costly to
process and sort; the second type has the added potential to come apart in the mail, resulting in its failure to reach
the addressee. None of these circumstances benefits the mailer, the Postal Service, or the addressee. The proposed
change will further Postal Service efforts to provide efficient and timely service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first of these mandatory placement standards affects flat-size mailpieces not prepared in a full enclosure and
that may have an open edge presented either forward (as the piece travels through mechanization) or to the right (as
the piece is held for manual sortation, casing, or delivery). The proposed revisions would require that such mail
be addressed so that, when oriented to read the address, the mailpiece is positioned for more efficient processing,
i.e., with its bound or final-folded edge to the right, and that pieces in partial wrappers or sleeves would have to
have the open ends at the top and bottom of the mailpiece. The Postal Service, which has traditionally recommended
that such mail be addressed in the manner described in the proposed rule (see existing Exhibit A200.1.3), has received
only limited cooperation from mailers and, consequently, has been unable to improve the efficiency with which that
mail can be handled. Some mailers (and some postal employees) have said that they were uncertain about whether the
proposed placement was previously required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposing this standard, the Postal Service seeks to balance the needs of the mailing community with its own operational
need to curtail undesirable addressing practices that raise postal costs. Further, the Postal Service realizes
that, if adopted as a final rule, the operational effect of this proposal on some mailers would require considerable
lead time before actual implementation. Therefore, commenters who are concerned about the effect this proposal
would have on their operations are asked to provide specific information and suggestions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How could the problems associated with handling the affected mail be overcome by measures other than the proposed
rule as written?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the proposed rule is adopted, how much lead time would be needed to make the necessary internal operational changes?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Would a short-term general implementation date be acceptable if the Postal Service worked with individual customers
and allowed specific exceptions for delayed implementation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second mandatory address placement standard requires that flat-size mailpieces prepared in an unattached sleeve
or partial wrapper must bear a delivery address on the item being mailed itself, by addressing just the item (provided
that the address remains visible when the item is mailed), by addressing both the item and the wrapper, or by using an
address label to firmly attach the item and its wrapper. (Flat-size pieces would also have to meet the standard proposed
above.) The Postal Service has no preference for the method chosen, instead focusing on the objective: Ensuring that
separation of the item and its wrapper do not result in the item becoming undeliverable. Some customers have complained
that existing addressing methods sometimes cause them not to get this type of mail or to receive only the wrapper, pointing
out that the Postal Service's tolerance of the underlying addressing practice is contrary to the best interests of
the addressee. Recognizing the validity of these complaints, the Postal Service proposes to require those mailers
who generate flat-size mailpieces prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper to move to an addressing method
that corrects the problem just described. Commenters who object to this proposal are asked to provide constructive
responses to the same questions asked for in the proposed revision discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For consistency, A200.1.3 would be revised to incorporate a reference to the foregoing sections. Other organizational
changes are proposed to A010.1.0 that do not affect the substance of the standards.

3. C010.1.0 is amended to reduce the role of address placement in the determination of which of a mailpiece's physical
dimensions are its length, height, and thickness. Existing standards are inconsistent in associating these basic
physical dimensions to the delivery address. The proposed rule would remedy this by establishing consistent definitions,
based on the physical characteristics of the mailpiece. For the typical letter-size piece, the proposed rule always
defines its length (horizontal dimension) as the longest dimension; the mailpiece's height (vertical dimension)
is the next longest dimension, and the thickness is the remaining dimension. Variations on this rule are proposed
for pieces that do not have three unequal dimensions. While the Postal Service realizes that this change may affect
a small volume of customer mail, as discussed above, the benefits of the consistent definitions contained in the changes
proposed below, and of the processing efficiencies of the mail these proposals would produce, far outweigh any loss
of creative latitude. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. C050.1.0 is amended for consistency. By the revised wording, assignment of most mailpieces to a processing category
depends solely on their dimensions as determined by C010.1.0. Existing standards base processing category on physical
dimensions, without regard to address placement, so that the proposed rule, in effect, makes only minor changes to
ensure that this section is harmonious with those discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. C050.5.0 is amended to make it clear that merchandise samples are not by definition always irregular parcels, and
may be categorized as letter- or flat-size pieces based on the usual criteria.

1. These proposed changes to Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards relate to the content and placement of delivery
and return addresses. The proposed revisions are intended to serve two general purposes: making existing standards
more consistent and improving the address quality of mail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Revisions to the standards in A010.4.3 and 4.5 are proposed to mandate the use of a ZIP Code or ZIP+4 code in the return
address on certain mail. (The standard for required use of a return address is not changed by these proposals.) Specifically,
by the proposed revision to A010.4.3, the correct ZIP Code or ZIP+4 code would be required in the return address on any
mail where a return address is itself required under existing standards. Further, by the proposed change to A010.4.5,
the existing placement standard for the return address on mail claimed at a ZIP+4 rate is both made more specific and
extended to all mail on which a return address is required. Under the proposed rule, the return address must be placed
in the top left corner of the address side, area, or label of the mailpiece, parallel to the delivery address. On ZIP+4
rate cards and letter-size mailpieces that do not bear a delivery point barcode, the return address would have to be
outside the OCR read area (a current requirement applied broadly to all ZIP+4 rate mail). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions should facilitate the accurate and efficient return of mail by making complete return address
information available in a readily identifiable location. Because mailers know their own ZIP Codes, the Postal Service
believes that the proposed standards do not represent either a significant new burden on customers or one that customers
will have serious problems in implementing. Customers who believe that deferred implementation will be necessary
are asked to indicate this in their comments, with an explanation of why they require deferral and how long an adjustment
period they require, and should propose appropriate terms for excepting those mailers/mailings while the necessary
operational adjustments are made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A010.5.3 is added to clarify the meaning and appropriate use of the terms ``post office box,'' ``P. O. Box,'' ``PO
Box,'' ``POB,'' ``P. O. B.,'' and similar combinations. These terms are sometimes incorrectly used to denote destinations
other than post office box or caller service, such as a rural or highway contract route box, a college or business mailroom
box, or a private commercial mail receiving agent. As a result, the imprecise use of terms conveys incorrect information
or causes misinterpretation, either of which sometimes impedes the Postal Service in providing the desired service_delivering
the mail where the sender intends. The potential for misdelivery has increased in today's automated mail processing
environment: Optical character readers scan and ``read'' addresses to determine the correct delivery point barcode
to assign to the mailpiece. Once this barcode is applied, the mailpiece is processed with minimal human intervention
so that ambiguous address information applied by the mailer may result in a misdirected mailpiece. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To avoid these potential delivery problems, the proposed standard defines the terms ``post office box,'' ``P. O.
Box,'' ``PO Box,'' ``POB,'' ``P. O. B.,'' and similar combinations as referring exclusively to the delivery services
provided by the Postal Service under D910 and D920 (Post Office Box Service and Caller Service, respectively). The
proposed standard states that those terms are always included in the correct address of mail destined for post office
box or caller service addresses, that they are incorrect for mail intended for other addresses, and that the Postal
Service cannot ensure accurate delivery of incorrectly addressed mail. (Correct addressing practices are described
in detail in Publication 28, Postal Addressing Standards, available from postal business centers and larger post
offices.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule will not have an adverse affect on customers because it merely clarifies the correct use of these
terms. Moreover, many large mailers have already taken measures to improve the quality of their address lists, and
may have already standardized such lists in conformance with the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A010.3.2c is also revised for organizational consistency.

5. Proposed changes to A010.5.1 should minimize the problems associated with dual addresses. Dual addresses, which
typically include both a street address and a post office box, can lead to confusion for USPS employees identifying
to which location the Postal Service is expected to make delivery despite the existing standards that the address
immediately above the city-state-ZIP Code line takes precedence. Dual addressing can result in a potential for misdelivery
(to the unintended address) as well as the potential for confusion and dissatisfaction on the part of the sender, addressee,
or both. (Under the proposed rule, for those ZIP Code areas having no delivery service other than by post office box
service, the correct address will be to the intended recipient's post office box address.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accurate delivery to the intended addressee is always important, but more so when the item has been identified by the
sender as having exceptional value through the level of service selected (e.g., Express Mail or Priority Mail, or
registered, certified, restricted delivery, or special delivery mail). Therefore, under the proposed rule, dual
addresses are prohibited in the delivery and return addresses on those types of mail. Although this change may cause
occasional inconvenience for some customers, the Postal Service believes that any inconvenience is more than offset
by elimination of the ambiguity and delay potentially associated with dual addressing. This benefit is particularly
true because the sender has invested a relatively large sum to ensure safe and accurate delivery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also prohibits dual addresses on any mail claimed at a bulk or presort rate. Because of the problems
described above, allowing dual addressing on this mail would be inconsistent with the Postal Service's ongoing efforts
to improve address quality in volume mailings. Whereas this prohibition may have the appearance of a sweeping new
requirement, its net affect should be minimal. Most mailers who use bulk or presort rates have enough awareness of
addressing standards to know why dual addresses are not advisable and, therefore, seldom use them. The majority of
those same mailers are already involved in ongoing address management to improve the quality of their addressing
practices.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specific conditions apply to certain types of mail; for purposes of these standards, letter-size mailpieces include
cards; flat-size mailpieces include letter-size pieces eligible for and claimed at a Barcoded rate for flats: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The delivery address must parallel the length of a letter-size mailpiece unless that piece is paid at a single-piece
rate. Letter-size mailpieces bearing an address oriented otherwise are not eligible for any presort or automation-based
discount and may be nonmailable or subject to a nonstandard surcharge. First-Class card-rate pieces and all mail
claimed at an automation rate are subject to additional standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. If flat-size mail is not prepared in an envelope, polybag, or similar complete enclosure, the delivery address
must be placed so that when the mailpiece is held to read the address, the bound edge or (if applicable) final-folded
edge of the mailpiece is to the right, the address is at the top of the mailpiece parallel with the top edge, and, for mailpieces
prepared in a sleeve or partial wrapper, the open ends of the sleeve or partial wrapper are at the top and bottom of the
mailpiece. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. If flat-size mail is prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper, the address must be placed on the enclosed
material so that it can be read without moving the wrapper, or on both the wrapper and the enclosed matter, unless the
address label is used to attach the wrapper to the enclosed matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. If mail including an attachment does not bear the name and address of both the sender and intended recipient on both
the host and the attachment, the sender's name and address must be placed on the host piece or the delivery address label
(which may also show the return address) must be used to affix the attachment securely to the host. Combination containers
that have inseparable parts or compartments (e.g., cartons with letter-size envelopes completely and securely
attached to one side) are mailable with the names and addresses on only one.

and E500, respectively. The detailed addressing standards for second-class mail are in A200. Additional standards
apply to overseas military mail, Department of State mail, mail in window envelopes, international mail, and mail
claimed at any automation rate.

the return address must be on the same side as, and parallel to, the delivery address, in the top left corner of the address
side, area, or label of the mailpiece. Also, on non-delivery point barcoded ZIP+4 rate mailpieces, the return address
must not be in the OCR read area, and must not extend farther than one-half the length of the mailpiece to the right edge,
and no lower than one-third the height of the mailpiece from the top (see Exhibit 4.5).

Dual Address

A dual address is one that contains two delivery points, e.g., a street address and a post office box number (see Exhibit
5.1), and is subject to these restrictions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A dual address is prohibited in the delivery and return addresses on Express Mail, Priority Mail, special delivery
mail, registered mail, certified mail, restricted delivery mail, and any mail claimed at a bulk or presort rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Other mail bearing a dual address is delivered (or returned, as applicable) to the address immediately above the
city and state (or to the post office box if both the street address and post office box are on the same line). If a ZIP+4
code or 5-digit ZIP Code is used in any dual address, it must correspond to the address element immediately above the
city and state (or with the post office box number in the address if both the street address and post office box are on
the same line).

The terms ``post office box,'' ``P. O. Box,'' ``PO Box,'' ``P. O. B.,'' ``POB,'' and other similar combinations refer
exclusively to the delivery services provided by the USPS under D910 and D920, and the correct address for those services
always includes one of these terms. These terms are not correctly used on mail intended for delivery through a private
box system or to other types of addresses (e.g., rural route boxes). The USPS cannot ensure accurate delivery of incorrectly
addressed mail.

forms or receipts; incidental First-Class attachments; or supplements, but only if those items and the host second-class
publication are enclosed within a plastic wrapper (polybag). The delivery address must parallel the length of a letter-size
mailpiece, as defined in C010.

Determining Length and Height 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided by 1.6, mailpiece length and height are determined as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. For pieces having three different dimensions, the longest dimension of a mailpiece is its length (horizontal dimension);
the next longest, its height (vertical dimension); the shortest, its thickness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. For pieces having two equal dimensions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the third dimension is longer than the equal dimensions, it is the mailpiece's length (horizontal dimension);
the remaining dimensions are its height and thickness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the third dimension is shorter than the equal dimensions, it is the mailpiece's thickness; of the remaining
dimensions, the length is the dimension parallel to the address as read; the height is the remaining dimension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. For pieces having three equal dimensions, or having an irregular shape, or requiring a specific orientation because
of the contents, the location and orientation of the address on the mailpiece establish which dimensions are its height
and length. The length is the dimension parallel to the address as read; the height is perpendicular to the length on
the address side of the piece.

Mailpieces to be claimed at the Barcoded rate for flats are subject to the definitions of length and height in C820 (rather

For single-piece rate mail and pieces eligible for and claimed at the Barcoded or third-class carrier route rate for
flats, the top and bottom of a letter- or flat-size mailpiece are its upper and lower edges, respectively, when the
delivery address is oriented to be read. For other mail, the top and bottom of a letter- or flat-size mailpiece are its
upper and lower edges, respectively, when the mailpiece is positioned with the length horizontal.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to disapprove the Operating Permits Program submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia for the purpose
of complying with Federal requirements which mandate that States develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing
operating permits to all major stationary sources, and to certain other sources. The reasons for proposing disapproval
are as follows: Virginia's program does not contain the necessary legal authority to afford judicial review to persons
who have participated in the public comment process, and it also does not contain the necessary legal authority to
prevent default issuance of a permit. The submitted regulations have an expiration date of June 28, 1994 and cannot
be applied or enforced after that date. Also, the regulatory portion of the program does not include the proper universe
of sources required to be subject to a state operating permit program or ensure that permits contain all applicable
requirements, or correctly delineating provisions enforceable only by the Commonwealth. In addition, there are
other deficiencies in Virginia's submitted program, as specified in the Technical Support Document, which must
be corrected before EPA can grant full approval to Virginia's operating permits program.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required under title V of the Clean Air Act (``CAA''), EPA has promulgated rules which define the minimum elements
of an approvable state operating permits program and the corresponding standards and procedures by which the EPA
will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating permits programs (see 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992)).
These rules are codified at 40 CFR part 70. Title V requires States to develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing
these operating permits to all major stationary sources and to certain other sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA requires that states develop and submit these programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA take actions
to approve or disapprove each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs
pursuant to section 502 of the CAA and 40 CFR part 70, which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval.
Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, EPA may grant the program interim
approval for a period of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by November 15, 1995, or by the end of an interim
program period, it must establish and implement a Federal operating permits program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 12, 1993, Virginia submitted an operating permits program for review by EPA. It was received by EPA on November
19, 1994. The submittal was supplemented by a letter dated January 14, 1994, and was found to be administratively complete
pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4(e)(1). The submittal contains a program description, a legal opinion from the Virginia Attorney
General, confirmation of regulatory authority, program and fee regulations, relevant portions of Virginia statutes,
guidance and forms, a description of enforcement provisions, a resource and fee demonstration, and a transition
plan.

B. Federal Oversight and Sanctions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sanctions must be imposed 18 months after EPA disapproves a state submittal, unless prior to expiration of the 18-month
period the state submits a revised program that EPA approves. If a state has not submitted a revised program that EPA
approves within 6 months after EPA applies the first sanction, a second sanction is required. In addition, discretionary
sanctions may be applied any time during the 18-month period following the date required for program submittal or
the date of program disapproval. If the Commonwealth does not have an approved program by November 15, 1995, EPA must
promulgate, administer, and enforce a Federal operating permits program for the Commonwealth.

II. Summary and Analysis of State Submission
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis contained in this document focuses on the major portions of Virginia's submittal and particularly portions
which must be corrected to meet the minimum requirements of 40 CFR part 70. The full program submittal, the Technical
Support Document, and other relevant materials are available for detailed information as part of the public docket.
The docket may be viewed during regular business hours at the address listed above.

A. Statutory Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Standing for Judicial Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Attorney General of the Commonwealth, in his opinion dated November 5, 1993, states that ``the laws of the Commonwealth
provide adequate authority to carry out all aspects of the Commonwealth's program for Federal operating permits.''
The Attorney General cites Va. Code section 10.1&hyph;1318(B) as providing an opportunity for judicial review to
any person who is aggrieved by a final decision of the State Air Pollution Control Board and who meets certain criteria,
including having an immediate, pecuniary, and substantial interest. The requirement for standing for judicial
review, as specifically required by section 502(b)(6) of the CAA and 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(x), must provide standing
for any person who has participated in the public comment process and any other person who could obtain judicial review
of that action under applicable law. EPA interprets section 502(b)(6) of the CAA as requiring that title V permits
programs must provide judicial review to any party who participated on the public comment process and who at a minimum
meets the threshold standing requirements of Article III of the U.S. Constitution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comparison, Section 10.1&hyph;1318(B) of the Code of Virginia extends the right to seek judicial review only to
persons who have suffered an ``actual, threatened, or imminent injury...'' where ``such injury is an invasions of
an immediate, legally protected, pecuniary and substantial interest which is concrete and particularized...''
The Virginia statute, as well Virginia case law does not enable a party who meets the minimum threshold standing requirements
of Article III of the U.S. Constitution access to the Commonwealth's court system. The Commonwealth's Attorney General's
opinion submitted with Virginia's program states that ``the inclusion of the word 'pecuniary' in the amended Virginia
law means the requirement for standing to obtain judicial review may be more stringent than Article III standing requirements,
as the EPA interprets them under the United States Supreme Court decision in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Defenders of Wildlife
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136 (1992) and related cases.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limitations on judicial review in Virginia do not meet the minimum threshold standing requirements of Article
III of the U.S. Constitution and thus do not meet the minimum program approval criteria under title V. Therefore, EPA
is proposing to disapprove Virginia's program because it does not meet the minimum requirement for standing for judicial
review. Va. Code section 10.1&hyph;1318(B) must be amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Default Issuance of Permits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Va. Code section 9&hyph;6.14:3 provides that the purpose of Virginia's Administrative Process Act is to supplement
present and future basic laws. Although Regulations sections 120&hyph;08&hyph;0525 C and E provide for EPA veto
and affected states review, these regulations may be superseded by the Administrative Process Act. Sections 9&hyph;6.14:11
and 9&hyph;6.14:12 of the Administrative Process Act provide that a party may provide written notice to the agency
that a decision on a permit is due, and that the decision is deemed in favor of the named party if no decision is reached
within 30 days. This provision prevents the Commonwealth from meeting the requirement of section 505(b)(3) of the
CAA that no permit be issued unless it is revised to meet the objection of EPA, if EPA objects to the permit within 45 days
after receiving a copy of the proposed permit. This provision also prevents the Commonwealth from meeting &sect;70.8(e),
which requires the Attorney General to certify that no provision of state law requires that a permit be issued after
a certain time if the permitting authority has failed to take action on the application. Virginia must ensure that
no permit will be issued by default through this process until affected states and EPA have had a chance to review the
proposed permit as required by 40 CFR 70.8. In addition Virginia must ensure that no permit will be issued through this
process if EPA has objected within 45 days. EPA is proposing to disapprove Virginia's program because it does not ensure
that EPA and affected states are given an adequate opportunity for review of proposed permits and that no permit will
be issued if EPA objects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Effectiveness and Enforceability of Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Virginia operating permit program Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution (Regulations)
Emergency Rule 8&hyph;5, Federal Operating Permits for Stationary Sources, and Emergency Rule 8&hyph;6, Permit
Program Fees, do not meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. Although the rules are currently effective, they expire
on June 28, 1994 and cannot be implemented or enforced beyond that date. EPA is proposing to disapprove Virginia's
program because its regulations expire on June 28, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Applicability Under the Operating Permits Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Definitions and Exemptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirements of &sect;&sect;70.2 and 70.3 for applicability have not been met. Primarily, Virginia's regulations
at section 120&hyph;08&hyph;0502 and section 120&hyph;08&hyph;0602 do not correctly define major source or stationary
source. Virginia's definitions, and the exemptions of insignificant activities and affected sources found in section
120&hyph;08&hyph;0501 of Virginia's regulations limit the universe of sources that are applicable to Rule 8&hyph;5
by exempting or deferring sources that are required by 40 CFR part 70 to obtain an operating permit. EPA is proposing
to disapprove Virginia's program because the regulations do not apply to the proper universe of sources. Further
discussion of these deficiencies is contained in the Technical Support Document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Variances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Virginia has the authority to issue a variance from requirements imposed by Virginia law. The variance provision
at Va. Code section 10.1&hyph;1307.C. empowers the Air Pollution Control Board, after a public hearing, to grant
a local variance from any regulation adopted by the board. EPA regards this provision as wholly external to the program
submitted for approval under 40 CFR part 70, and consequently is proposing to take no action on this provision of Virginia
law. EPA has no authority to approve provisions of state law, such as the variance provision referred to, which are
inconsistent with the CAA. EPA does not recognize the ability of a permitting authority to grant relief from the duty
to comply with a federally enforceable permit, except where such relief is granted through procedures allowed by
40 CFR part 70. EPA reserves the right to enforce the terms of the permit where the permitting authority purports to
grant relief from the duty to comply with a permit in a manner inconsistent with 40 CFR part 70 procedures.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Applicable Federal Requirements and Federally Enforceable Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia's submittal does not ensure the Commonwealth's ability to issue permits which include all applicable Federal
requirements and which correctly delineate requirements that are enforceable only by Virginia. The Commonwealth
also cites Virginia's regulations rather than Federal regulations (in the form of federally promulgated regulations
or state regulations that have been approved into the State Implementation Plan) in the definitions in section 120&hyph;08&hyph;0502.
In section 120&hyph;08&hyph;0507, Federal enforceability is incorrectly extended to portions of Virginia's regulations
that have been submitted, but not yet approved, into the State Implementation Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to disapprove Virginia's program because it explicitly purports to extend Federal enforceability
to provisions which are not enforceable by the administrator and also does not include certain provisions which must
be considered federally enforceable (and thus applicable) requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Public Participation and Affected State Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia uses the term ``locality particularly affected'' in determining the geographic scope of notification
to the public of a public comment period on a draft permit. This scope is too narrow and it does not fully meet the requirements
of 40 CFR 70.7(h) for public participation. For full approval, Virginia must ensure that any locality that could potentially
be affected by a permit would be notified of the opportunity for public comment on that permit. In addition, Virginia
incorrectly exempts minor permit modifications from the requirement under &sect;70.8(b)(2) for affected state
review of those modifications. Virginia must also correct this deficiency before EPA can grant full approval to Virginia's
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Permit Fees and Demonstration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Va. Code section 10.1&hyph;1322.1 and Rule 8&hyph;6 allow for a fee rate of up to $25 per ton, as adjusted by the consumer
price index (CPI), of emissions to be charged to a source. The fee is set by the Air Pollution Control Board and can be
adjusted annually, without exceeding the statutory cap, to meet the costs of implementation of the program. Virginia's
fee revenue projections are based on revenues from a $25 per ton fee, using 1990 as a base year, and adjusted annually
by the CPI, as set out in Section 502 of the CAA. However, no specific fee schedule was included in the submittal and the
cap on the fee amount limits the Board's flexibility in ensuring that revenues are sufficient to cover the direct and
indirect costs of the program. (CAA section 502(b)(3)(A) and Va. Code section 10.1&hyph;1322. B.) Va. Code section
10.1&hyph;1322. B. precludes the Commonwealth from collecting title V fees to cover the indirect costs charged and
collected by the Commonwealth's Department of Accounts. This provision violates 40 CFR 70.9(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fee amounts projected by Virginia in the ``Total Fee Revenue Projections'' table, although sufficient to cover
the estimated costs of the program (as set out in the resource demonstration), do not accurately reflect the mandate
of Va. Code section 10.1&hyph;1322.1 to adjust fees using the CPI calculation method stipulated in CAA section 502.
Also, it is unclear whether or not the estimated emissions used in the ``Total Fee Revenue Projections'' table include
emissions from acid rain sources, which Virginia exempts from fees in the years 1995 to 1999 (section 120&hyph;08&hyph;0601
C.5.) or includes Hazardous Air Pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for EPA to grant full approval to Virginia's program, the Commonwealth must remove the statutory impediment
to using permit fees to fund certain indirect costs of its program and ensure that the Commonwealth's fee provision
comply with 40 CFR part 70.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Authority and Commitments for Section 112 Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Va. Code section 10.1&hyph;1322.A. and Rule 8&hyph;5, Virginia has demonstrated broad legal authority to incorporate
into permits and enforce all applicable CAA section 112 requirements. However, Virginia also indicated that additional
authority may be necessary to conduct specific section 112 activities, and did not commit to implementing CAA section
112(r) for prevention of accidental release. Virginia supplemented its broad legal authority with a commitment
to ``develop the state regulatory provisions as necessary to carry out these programs and the responsibilities under
the delegation after approval of the operating permit program and EPA has issued the prerequisite guidance for development
of these title III programs.'' Also, Virginia has the authority under section 120&hyph;08&hyph;0505 K to require
that an applicant state that the source has complied with CAA section 112(r) or state in the compliance plan that the
source intends to comply and has set a schedule to do so. In the case of CAA section 112(g) requirements, EPA notes that
Virginia must begin to implement this program upon approval of an operating permits program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia has committed to adopting regulations to meet the requirements of the Acid Rain program by January 1, 1995.
The Attorney General, in his November 5, 1993 opinion, committed to including a statutory and regulatory analysis
of the acid rain portions of the operating permits program in the January 1, 1995 submittal. Virginia has begun its
regulatory development process to adopt regulations for the acid rain portion of the Virginia Operating Permits
Program.

Proposed Action

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to disapprove the operating permits program submitted by the Commonwealth on November 12, 1993.
If promulgated, this disapproval will constitute a disapproval under section 502(d) of the CAA (see generally 57
FR 32253&hyph;32254). As provided under section 502(d)(1) of the CAA, the Commonwealth will have up to 180 days from
the date of EPA's notification of disapproval for the Governor of Virginia to revise and resubmit the program. EPA
is proposing to disapprove this program on the basis that Virginia has not met the following five requirements:

in the permit process, including statutory authority that meets the minimum threshold for judicial standing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Pursuant to section 505(b)(3) of the CAA and 40 CFR 70.8(e), authority to prevent default issuance of permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Regulations that expire on June 28, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Issuance of permits to the proper universe of sources required by 40 CFR part 70 to be included in the Commonwealth's
operating permit program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Regulations that meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 70 ensuring issuance of permits that contain all applicable

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virginia must amend its program to correct the deficiencies and resubmit all relevant portions of the program, including
a revised Attorney General's opinion. The Technical Support Document discusses Virginia's submittal in detail,
and contains specific references to revisions and modifications necessary to obtain full approval. Submittal of
revised portions of Virginia's operating permit program, including revised statutes and regulations, will undergo
additional notice and comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 before EPA takes final action on the program submittal, if those revised portions are received before November 19,
1994. November 19, 1994 is one year from the date of receipt of the submittal and the date by which EPA is required under
40 CFR 70.4(e) to take final action on the current submittal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commonwealth of Virginia must submit a corrected program within 180 days following final EPA disapproval of the
program. If Virginia fails to submit a fully approvable whole part 70 program, or a required revision thereto, in conformance
with the provision of 40 CFR 70.4, EPA may, at any time, apply one of the sanctions specified in section 179(b) of the
Act. Sanctions must be imposed 18 months after EPA disapproves a state's submittal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify
that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include
small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's disapproval of the State request under section 502 of the CAA does not affect any existing requirements applicable
to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval
of the State submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does
not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not impose any new Federal requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Regional Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove Virginia's operating permits program will be based
on whether it meets the requirements of title V of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in 40 CFR part 70.

Summary of the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The following is a summary of the Commission's further notice of proposed rulemaking in CC Docket No. 92&hyph;115,
adopted April 20, 1994 and released May 20, 1994. The full texts of all Commission decisions are available for inspection
and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Docket Branch (room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. The
complete text of this decision may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Services, (202) 857&hyph;3800, 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. In this Further Notice, the Federal Communications Commission proposes further revisions to 47 CFR part 22. The
rules in part 22 govern the Public Mobile Services. These revisions are proposed in order to eliminate unnecessary
information collection requirements, streamline licensing procedures, reduce the processing and review burden
on the Commission's staff, and ensure that licensees in the public mobile services are fully qualified to provide
service to the public as expeditiously as possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On May 14, 1992, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the docket 57 FR 29260, July 1, 1992 proposing
comprehensive revisions to part 22. Prior to adoption of a Report and Order in this proceeding, Congress enacted the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act) which amends section 3(n) and section 332 of the Communications
Act. The Budget Act creates a comprehensive regulatory framework for all mobile radio services, including existing
part 22 common carrier mobile services, private land mobile services, and future services. Because of the broad statutory
changes that affect the regulation of mobile services, action on the part 22 revision was deferred. The proposals
adopted in the further notice augment those proposals adopted in the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. We propose to require licensees notifying the Commission of minor modifications to their systems on FCC Form 489,
which include Service Area Boundary (SAB) extensions into the adjacent market, to specify whether the 5 year fill-in
period for the market has expired and, if so, to state that the SAB extension does not cover any unserved area. Current
rules allow a cellular licensee to expand its SAB into an adjacent cellular service territory pursuant to a written
agreement with the latter licensee. A licensee is permitted to expand its SAB into an adjacent cellular geographic
service area (CGSA) at any time and may extend into an adjacent metropolitan service area or a rural service area provided
the 5 year fill-in period has not expired. Many of the contracts included with FCC Forms 489 that notify the Commission
of such minor modifications simply acknowledge a licensee's permission to allow a SAB extension into its market,
even when the 5 year fill-in period has expired. In these cases, the staff must devote a significant amount of time to
determine if the SAB extension covers any unserved area, because licensees may apply to serve such area only by filing
a separate application with the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. We propose to revise the scale of the maps required to be filed by the Commission's rules from 1:250,000 to 1:500,000.
We believe that reducing the map scale would serve the public interest by reducing both filing burdens on applicants
as well as review burdens on the staff.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. We propose to modify the rules to allow cellular licensees to make minor changes to their facilities and to add transmitters
within the contours of authorized stations without seeking prior approval or notifying the Commission of such changes.
If we adopt this proposal, we plan to eliminate the listing of internal cell sites on our authorizations for existing
licensees. However, we intend to maintain accurate, current information regarding the cell sites that constitute
a system's CGSA boundary_i.e., the external cell sites. Therefore, we propose to require all cellular licenses to
submit the following information for each of their external cell sites: (1) The geographic coordinates and cell site
location description as required in Item 27 on Schedule B of FCC Form 401 and (2) the operating and technical parameters
for the cell site which is currently required in Table MOB 2 and Table MOB 3 of FCC Form 401. This is a one time filing that
would assist the staff in updating the Commission's database systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. We propose to modify the information that licensees must submit pursuant to rule &sect;22.925 of the Commission's
rules. First, consistent with the proposal to revise the map scale, we propose to revise the scale of the full-size
map to a scale of 1:500,000. Second, we propose to require that all maps submitted pursuant to this rule show only the
exterior cell sites and their respective service area boundaries that make up the CGSA. Third, we propose to require
licensees to include an exhibit providing the coordinates for each exterior cell site and the information currently
required in the MOB 3 Table of FCC Form 401. Fourth, we propose to eliminate the requirement that licensees submit a
frequency utilization plan or chart. Fifth, we propose to require licensees to label all System Information Update
maps with specific language explaining which carrier is filing the map and for which market.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
7. We propose that for all 931 MHz paging applications, applicants must specify the frequency for which they seek authorization.
The frequency requested must be available at the time the application is filed. Applications that are acceptable
for filing will be placed on public notice. Mutually exclusive applications received within 30 days after the public
notice will be considered one processing group. Mutually exclusive applicants for specific frequencies that are
accepted for filing after July 26, 1993 would be subject to the competitive bidding process. We also propose that applicants
for 931 MHz paging frequencies with applications pending when final rules become effective be given 60 days from the
effective date of a final order in this proceeding to amend their applications to specify frequencies for which they
seek authorization. Failure to amend a pending application to specify a frequency will result in dismissal of that
application. All pending amended applications and newly filed applications that are mutually exclusive and received
within 60 days of the effective date of this Order will be considered together as a processing group this one time only.
We propose that the amended applications be subject to the competitive bidding process. However, we seek comment
on whether we should instead use lotteries for these applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. We propose to consider the following to be an initial 931 MHz paging application: (1) an application anywhere on
a new frequency and (2) a proposal to locate a new facility more than two kilometers (1.6 miles) from any existing facility
operating on the same frequency. A 931 MHz paging application would be considered a modification of an existing system
only if: (1) It proposes a new location two kilometers or less from a previously authorized and fully operational base
station licensed to the same licensee operating on the same frequency; or (2) the application is for a change of location
within two kilometers of an existing station licensed to the same licensee; or (3) the application proposes a technical
change that would not increase the service contour. We tentatively conclude that we will use first come, first served
procedures to process 931 MHz paging modification licenses in cases in which we conclude, as a result of our examination
of the issue in this rulemaking proceeding, that the use of competitive bidding procedures would not be legally permissible
or otherwise appropriate. Under the first come, first served procedure, only manually exclusive modification applications
received on the same day would, consistent with the Budget Act, be designated for comparative hearing to determine
which modification application should be granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. We welcome comment on any and all of the proposed further revisions to 47 CFR part 22. We also invite suggestions for
any other proposals or refinements to the proposals that we have made in this proceeding.

 The further notice of proposed rulemaking solicits public comment to revise part 22 of FCC's rules governing the Public
Mobile Services. The revisions are proposed in order to make the rules easier to understand, eliminate outdated rules
and unnecessary information collection requirements, streamline licensing procedures, and allow licensees greater
flexibility in providing service to the public. Generally, the collected information is used to determine the legal
and technical qualifications of the respondents.

The Commission is proposing to revise title 47, part 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations to eliminate unnecessary
information collection requirements and, whenever possible, provide greater flexibility to carriers while at
the same time promoting the public interest. The objective of this proposal is to provide effective and adaptive regulation
for communications.

The proposed rules would not significantly change the existing reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements.
In the case of required map filings, for example, the proposal merely changes the scale of the map filed. Several new
requirements are proposed. For example, one of the proposed new rules would require that cellular licensees submit
information for each of their external cell sites. Another proposed rule would require that applicants for 931 MHz
paging service request specific frequencies in their applications.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule originated based on a recommendation in the General Accounting Office (GAO) report dated October
30, 1991, entitled ``Economy and Efficiency Audits Can Help Reduce Overhead Costs,'' which recommends that regulations
be revised to provide guidance for the use of overhead should-cost reviews. The proposed rule modifies DFARS 215.810
to supplement the FAR rule published for public comment on April 6, 1994 (59 FR 16388). It provides specific criteria
for when DoD activities should consider performing should-cost reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule is not expected to have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, because contracts awarded to small entities normally are not subject to program or overhead should-cost reviews.
An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small
businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS sections will
also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS
Case 94&hyph;610 in correspondence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule does not impose any additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements which require the approval
of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

(b)(i) The Defense Contract Management Command/Defense Logistics Agency (DCMC/DLA), or the military department
responsible for performing contract administration functions (e.g., Navy SUPSHIP), should consider performing
an overhead should-cost review of a contractor business unit (as defined in FAR 31.001) when all the following conditions
exist_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Projected annual sales to DoD exceed $1 billion;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Projected DoD vs. total business exceeds 30 percent;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) High level of sole-source DoD contracts;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Significant volume of proposal activity anticipated; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Production or development of major weapon system or program anticipated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The head of the contracting activity may request an overhead should-cost review for a business unit which does
not meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(i) of this subsection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Overhead should-cost reviews are labor intensive and require participation by the buying activities, contract
administration, and contract audit elements. The extent of availability of military department, contract administration,
and contract audit resources to support DCMC/DLA-led teams should be considered when determining whether a review
will be conducted. Overhead should-cost reviews generally shall not be conducted at a contractor business segment
more frequently than every three years.

 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management
Council submit any fishery management plan or plan amendment it prepares to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)
for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary,
upon reviewing the plan or amendment, must immediately publish a notice that the plan or amendment is available for
public review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments received during the comment period in
determining whether to approve the plan or amendment.

Amendments 31 and 35 to the respective FMPs would implement the Modified Block proposal to the Pacific halibut and
sablefish IFQ program. These amendments would authorize the issuance of quota share (QS) blocks for QS that would
have resulted in less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ based on the 1994 total allowable catch for fixed gear in the halibut
and sablefish fisheries, allow the combination of QS blocks that are less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ for halibut and
less than 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) for sablefish, and restrict the amount of blocks that may be held in any one IFQ regulatory
area. These amendments are intended to prevent excessive consolidation of the Pacific halibut and sablefish fisheries
off Alaska, and are consistent with the management objectives of the Magnuson Act and the Northern Pacific Halibut
Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the form of an amended tentative
final monograph that would establish conditions under which over-the-counter (OTC) topical health-care antiseptic
drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. FDA is issuing this notice of proposed
rulemaking to amend the previous notice of proposed rulemaking on topical antimicrobial drug products (see the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1978, 43 FR 1210) after considering the public comments on that notice and other information in the administrative
record for this rulemaking. FDA is also requesting data and information concerning the safety and effectiveness
of topical antimicrobials for use as hand sanitizers or dips. This proposal is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug
products conducted by FDA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1978 (43 FR 1210), FDA published, under &sect;330.10(a)(7), a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish
a monograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products, based on the recommendations of the Antimicrobial I Panel
and the agency's response to comments submitted following publication of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking.
Interested persons were invited to submit objections or requests for oral hearing by February 6, 1978. In response
to numerous requests to extend the time period for submitting objections or requests for oral hearing, the agency
issued a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 3, 1978 (43 FR 4637) granting an extension of the deadline to March 6, 1978. During this time period, the
agency received 6 petitions that requested reopening the administrative record and 11 requests for an oral hearing.
In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 9, 1979 (44 FR 13041), the agency deferred action on the requests for a hearing, but granted the petitions to
reopen the record to allow interested persons to submit comments and any new or additional data by June 7, 1979, and
reply comments by July 9, 1979. FDA also stated its intent to publish an updated (amended) tentative final monograph
based on the review and evaluation of new submissions and a reevaluation of existing data.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 26, 1979 (44 FR 61609), the agency again reopened the administrative record for the submission of new data
by March 26, 1980, and for comments on the new data by May 27, 1980. This action was taken to permit manufacturers to submit
the results of testing to FDA as expeditiously as possible prior to establishment of a final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the June 7, 1979, closing date for the submission of new data, and prior to the October 26, 1979, reopening
of the administrative record, data and information were submitted to FDA. In a notice published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 21, 1980 (45 FR 18398), the agency advised that it had reopened the administrative record for OTC topical antimicrobial
drug products to allow for consideration of data and information that had been filed in the Dockets Management Branch
after the date the administrative record on the tentative final monograph had officially closed on March 6, 1978.
The agency concluded that any new data and information filed prior to March 21, 1980, should be available to the agency
in developing a proposed regulation in the form of a tentative final monograph.

 of September 7, 1982 (47 FR 39406), FDA issued a notice to reopen the administrative record for OTC topical antimicrobial
drug products to allow for consideration of the Miscellaneous External Panel's recommendations on topical antimicrobial
drug products used for the treatment of diaper rash. The agency discussed topical antimicrobial active ingredients
for this use in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;330.10(a)(10), the data and information considered by the Panels were put on public display
in the Dockets Management Branch (address above), after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information. In
response to the previous tentative final monograph and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for mercury-containing
drug products and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for alcohol drug products, 4 drug manufacturers' associations,
44 drug manufacturers, 1 medical device manufacturer, 1 drug distributor, 2 medical schools, 2 research laboratories,
1 law firm, and 1 consulting firm submitted comments. Copies of the comments received are also on public display in
the Dockets Management Branch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The advance notice of proposed rulemaking, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 13, 1974 (39 FR 33103), was designated as a ``proposed monograph'' in order to conform to terminology
used in the OTC drug review regulations (&sect;330.10). Similarly, the notice of proposed rulemaking, which was
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1978 (43 FR 1210), was designated as a ``tentative final monograph.'' The present document is also designated
as a ``tentative final monograph.'' The legal status of each tentative final monograph, however, is that of a proposed
rule. The present document is a reproposal regarding health-care antiseptic drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This antimicrobial rulemaking is broad in scope, encompassing products that may contain the same active ingredients,
but are labeled and marketed for different intended uses. For example, one group of products is primarily used by consumers
for ``first aid'' and includes skin antiseptics, skin wound cleansers, and skin wound protectants. Another group
of products, antiseptic handwashes, are used by consumers on a more frequent, even daily, basis and includes products
for personal use in the home, such as when caring for invalids and during family illness. A third group of products is
generally intended for use by health professionals and includes health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative
skin preparations, and surgical hand scrubs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to expedite the completion of the first aid section of the antimicrobial monograph, the agency published
a separate tentative final monograph for these products in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644). The non-first aid uses of topical antimicrobials, now identified as ``health-care
antiseptics,'' are addressed in this document. Although the amended tentative final monographs for first-aid antiseptics
and health-care antiseptics are being published separately, both categories will eventually be included under
part 333 (21 CFR part 333).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency also has decided that OTC topical antimicrobial and topical antibiotic drug products should be included
within the same monograph. Although an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a monograph for OTC topical
antibiotic drug products was published under part 342 (21 CFR part 342) on April 1, 1977 (42 FR 17642), the final monograph
for those products was issued on December 11, 1987 (52 FR 47312) as a new subpart of the OTC topical antimicrobial monograph,
part 333, subpart B_Topical First Aid Antibiotic Drug Products. Subpart A will cover first aid antiseptic drug products;
subpart C will cover antifungal drug products; subpart D covers acne drug products; and new subpart E will cover health-care
antiseptic drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this tentative final monograph (proposed rule) to establish subpart E of part 333, FDA states its position on the
establishment of a monograph for OTC health-care antiseptic drug products. This document addresses only those comments
and data concerning the previous antimicrobial tentative final monograph that are related to ``non-first aid uses,''
including products for personal use in the home and products used by health-care professionals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal constitutes FDA's reevaluation of the January 6, 1978 tentative final monograph based on the comments
received and the agency's independent evaluation of the Miscellaneous External Panel's reports on OTC alcohol and
mercury-containing drug products and the comments received. The following sections of the January 6, 1978 tentative
final monograph for topical antimicrobial drug products are being addressed in this document: &sect;&sect;333.1,
333.3, 333.30, 333.50, 333.85, 333.87, 333.97, and 333.99. The following sections of the advance notice of proposed
rulemaking for alcohol drug products are being addressed in this document: &sect;&sect;333.55 and 333.98. Modifications
have been made for clarity and regulatory accuracy and to reflect new information. Such new information has been placed
on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). These modifications are reflected in the following summary
of the comments and FDA's responses to them. (See section I.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTC drug procedural regulations (21 CFR 330.10) provide that any testing necessary to resolve the safety or effectiveness
issues that formerly resulted in a Category III classification, and submission to FDA of the results of that testing
or any other data, must be done during the OTC drug rulemaking process before the establishment of a final monograph.
Accordingly, FDA does not use the terms ``Category I'' (generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded),
``Category II'' (not generally recognized as safe and effective or misbranded), and ``Category III'' (available
data are insufficient to classify as safe and effective, and further testing is required) at the final monograph stage.
In place of Category I, the term ``monograph conditions'' is used; in place of Categories II and III, the term ``nonmonograph
conditions'' is used. This document retains the concepts of Categories I, II, and III at the tentative final monograph
stage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency advises that the conditions under which the drug products that are subject to this monograph would be generally
recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded (monograph conditions) will be effective 12 months after the
date of publication of the final monograph in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. On or after that date, no OTC drug product that is subject to the monograph and that contains a nonmonograph condition,
i.e., a condition that would cause the drug to be not generally recognized as safe and effective or to be misbranded,
may be initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it is the subject
of an approved application or abbreviated application (hereinafter called application). Further, any OTC drug
product subject to this monograph that is repackaged or relabeled after the effective date of the monograph must be
in compliance with the monograph regardless of the date the product was initially introduced or initially delivered
for introduction into interstate commerce. Manufacturers are encouraged to comply voluntarily with the monograph
at the earliest possible date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products (39 FR 33103), the agency
suggested that the conditions included in the monograph (Category I) be effective 30 days after the date of publication
of the final monograph in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and that the conditions excluded from the monograph (Category II) be eliminated from OTC drug products effective
6 months after the date of publication of the final monograph, regardless of whether further testing was undertaken
to justify their future use. Experience has shown that relabeling of products covered by the monograph is necessary
in order for manufacturers to comply with the monograph. New labels containing the monograph labeling have to be written,
ordered, received, and incorporated into the manufacturing process. The agency has determined that it is impractical
to expect new labeling to be in effect 30 days after the date of publication of the final monograph. Experience has shown
also that if the deadline for relabeling is too short, the agency is burdened with extension requests and related paperwork.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, some products will have to be reformulated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the monograph. Reformulation often involves the need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to do stability testing on the new product. An accelerated aging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process may be used to test a new formulation; however, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stability testing is not successful, and if further reformulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required, there could be a further delay in having a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product available for manufacture. The agency wishes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a reasonable period of time for relabeling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reformulation in order to avoid an unnecessary disruption of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketplace that could not only result in economic loss, but also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interfere with consumers' access to safe and effective drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. Therefore, the agency is proposing that the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph be effective 12 months after the date of its publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The agency believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 12 months after the date of publication most manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can order new labeling and reformulate their products and have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them in compliance in the marketplace. If the agency determines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that any labeling for a condition included in the final monograph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be implemented sooner than the 12-month effective date, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shorter deadline may be established. Similarly, if a safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem is identified for a particular nonmonograph condition, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shorter deadline may be set for removal of that condition from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTC drug products.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Two comments contended that OTC drug monographs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretive, as opposed to substantive, regulations. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment referred to statements on this issue submitted earlier to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other OTC drug rulemaking proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency addressed this issue in paragraphs 85 through 91 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the preamble to the procedures for classification of OTC drug products, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 11, 1972 (37 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 9464 at 9471 to 9472), and in paragraph 3 of the preamble to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tentative final monograph for OTC antacid drug products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 12, 1973 (38 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31260). FDA reaffirms the conclusions stated in those documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Court decisions have confirmed the agency's authority to issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantive regulations by rulemaking. (See, e.g.,

637 F.2d 887 (2d Cir. 1981).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. One comment pointed out that under ``Subpart B_Active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ingredients'' of the tentative final monograph, no CFR part number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was assigned to the category ``skin antiseptic.'' However, part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers were assigned to other categories without any Category I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients, with the term ``reserved'' in parentheses. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment requested that this omission be corrected in the amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The omission pointed out by the comment was an oversight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, it is no longer necessary to assign a CFR part number to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the category ``skin antiseptic,'' because skin antiseptics have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been included in broader categories identified as first aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptics in the amended tentative final monograph for first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid antiseptics (56 FR 33644) and as health-care antiseptics in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this tentative final monograph. (See section I.B., comment 3.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All Category I first aid antiseptic and health-care antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
active ingredients have been listed in the amended tentative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final monograph under subpart A and subpart E, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. A number of comments objected to the Panel's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation for separate statements of identity in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling of products containing the same antimicrobial active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient. As an example, several comments noted that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine has several professional uses (health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel handwash, skin antiseptic, and surgical hand scrub) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketing a product in conformance with two or more product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories becomes difficult because there are different labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for each drug product category. Some comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested FDA to combine the drug product category designations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or to add a new multipurpose product category that allows the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combining of labeling indications now included in several product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories. One comment specifically recommended that the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider changing product class designations and/or adding a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product class ``Multi Purpose Skin Prep'' or ``Skin Prep,'' with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indications for use including those listed under &sect;333.85 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(health-care personnel hand wash), &sect;333.87 (patient preoperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin preparation), &sect;333.90 (skin antiseptic), and &sect;333.97 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(surgical hand scrub). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment stated that the word ``skin'' was superfluous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because all OTC antiseptics are intended only for use on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin; still another comment contended that the statement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identity ``antiseptic'' is preferable to ``skin antiseptic'' because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products are used on cuts, scratches, and mucous membranes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as skin.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reopening of the administrative record for alcohol drug products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for topical antimicrobial OTC use published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 21, 1982 (47 FR 22324), one comment objected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statement of identity in proposed &sect;333.98(a) which read, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``alcohol for topical antimicrobial use,'' (47 FR 22324 at 22332). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment stated that this term would be confusing to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer and suggested the term ``antiseptic for the skin.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that OTC topical antimicrobial drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products need not have multiple statements of identity. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing the statements of identity recommended by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Antimicrobial I Panel (39 FR 33103), i.e., health-care personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, skin antiseptic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgical hand scrub, and the statement of identity recommended by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Miscellaneous External Panel (47 FR 22324), i.e., alcohol for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical antimicrobial use, the agency has determined that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general term ``antiseptic'' broadly describes all proposed product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories and reflects the basic intended uses of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. The agency believes that the statement of identity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``multiple purpose skin prep'' or ``skin prep'' recommended by one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment would not as clearly and succinctly describe the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products as the statement of identity ``antiseptic.'' As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in section I.B., comment 5, the agency is also proposing an additional term ``antiseptic handwash'' as
a statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of identity to describe products for home use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the first aid antiseptic segment of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking (56 FR 33644 at 33647), the term ``skin'' has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deleted from the previously proposed statement of identity ``skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic.'' Although several comments felt that the word ``skin'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was superfluous, the agency has no objection to the statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``antiseptic for the skin'' or ``skin antiseptic'' appearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elsewhere in the labeling of these products as additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to the consumer or health-care professional, provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it does not appear in any portion of the labeling required by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph and does not detract from such required information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See section I.I., comment 19.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the first aid antiseptic segment of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking (56 FR 33644 at 33647), the agency believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term ``antiseptic'' is readily understood by consumers. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also finds this to be true for health professionals. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is therefore proposing the term ``antiseptic'' as the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement of identity for all OTC topical antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients included in this tentative final monograph. Further, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also proposing that manufacturers may have an option to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an alternate statement of identity describing only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific intended use(s) of the product. Specifically, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is proposing that the statement of identity for antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug products in &sect;333.450(a) read as follows: ``The labeling of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a single-use product contains the established name of the drug, if any, and identifies the product as an `antiseptic'
and/or with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriate statement of identity described in &sect;&sect;333.455(a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
333.460(a), or 333.465(a). The labeling of a multiple-use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product contains the established name of the drug, if any, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may use the single statement of identity `antiseptic' and/or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate statements of identity described in &sect;&sect;333.455(a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
333.460(a), and 333.465(a). When `antiseptic' is used as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only statement of identity on a single-use or a multiple-use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, the intended use(s), such as patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, is to be included under the indications. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple-use products, a statement of the intended use should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also precede the specific directions for each use.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that the proposed labeling for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple-use products is flexible and provides manufacturers with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a number of options. However, the agency recognizes that some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers may wish to label their antiseptic drug products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with all of the allowable indications for a particular active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient and that this may give rise to difficulties in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporating all of the information on a product's various uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the limited space on an OTC label. The agency wishes to point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out that some portions of the proposed indications are optional, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i.e., the examples included in both the antiseptic and health-care personnel handwash indications, and need not
be incorporated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the labeling at all. In addition, manufacturers are free to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design ways of incorporating all the information on the various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses of their drug product through the use of flap labels, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redesigned packages, or package inserts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial ingredients be included in the monograph. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment requested clarification of the agency's views on trays or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kits that contain povidone-iodine and disposable instruments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(scissors, forceps, and hemostats) packed in a sterile package, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are designed to reduce the incidence of cross-infection in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This tentative final monograph does not provide for the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of devices such as brushes or sponges impregnated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobials, or of trays or kits that contain povidone-iodine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and disposable instruments, because the monograph is intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulate only OTC drug active ingredients. Since these comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were submitted, the agency has established procedures (see 21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 3) describing how it determines which agency component has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products comprised of any combination of a drug and a device. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, interested parties are encouraged to read the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document (Ref. 1) for guidance: ``Intercenter Agreement Between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Devices and Radiological Health.'' (See &sect;3.5 (21 CFR 3.5).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This agreement is on file in the Dockets Management Branch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(address above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. One comment expressed concern that the tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph failed to provide consumers with an antibacterial skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleanser for home use. The comment noted that, in addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional health care personnel, many consumers have a need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for cleansing products containing antibacterial agents for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of promoting good individual and family hygiene. Uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for such products include the following: (1) To reduce bacteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the hands and face to a greater extent than can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished with ordinary soap, and to prevent accumulation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteria from potential sources of contamination. The following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examples were cited: Cleansing oneself after changing a baby's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diaper, or after assisting aged or ill members of the household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with their toilet needs, and before preparing a family meal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The added benefit of an antibacterial cleanser for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minute cuts and abrasions from shaving and other minor traumas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The need for an antibacterial cleanser other than bar soap 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on local parts of the body such as the face because soap (alkali 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salts of fatty acids) can be irritating or too drying for some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals' needs. The comment recommended a new product class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under proposed &sect;333.90(a) (skin antiseptic) to be identified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Antimicrobial (or Antibacterial) Personal Cleanser'' with claims such as ``decreases bacteria on the skin''
and ``contains an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antibacterial agent.'' The comment also suggested that the 10-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum use limitation would not be appropriate for this product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class, but use could be restricted to 5 or 10 times daily. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment recommended that antimicrobial soaps be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed to make claims relating to general health care and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal hygiene similar to the claims allowed for health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel handwashes. The comment stated that an antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soap will reduce bacteria or the transfer of potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogenic micro-organisms in the home and, therefore, serves as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a preventive health care aid in controlling diseases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third comment requested the addition of a fourth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication for alcohol active ingredients in proposed &sect;333.98(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to allow use as an antibacterial handwash to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross-contamination from one individual to another. The comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argued that products containing alcohols are often used as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwashes by athletic trainers to help prevent the spread of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin infections from one individual to another in situations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which soap and water are not available, e.g., on the playing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fourth comment asserted that numerous other meaningful and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
truthful indications can be used which enhance the safe and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective use of a health-care personnel handwash. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the terms ``microbicidal cleanser'' or ``antiseptic germicidal skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleanser'' are appropriate and meaningful terminology describing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this use indication.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency agrees that antibacterial or antiseptic personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleanser products are practical for home use, to help prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross contamination from one person to another, especially after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diaper changing and caring for invalids or ill family members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also agrees with one comment that claims relating to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general health-care and personal hygiene similar to the claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed for health-care personnel handwashes may be suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because such claims explain the uses of these products in lay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency separated the first aid antiseptic uses of OTC topical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial drug products from the ``non-first aid uses.'' In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that document, the agency proposed that the following terms and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories be deleted: skin antiseptics, skin wound protectants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and skin wound cleansers; and the agency proposed that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate labeling, instead, be included in a new category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
called ``first aid antiseptics'' (56 FR 33644 at 33649). Several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses proposed by one comment, i.e., ``minute cuts and abrasions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from shaving and other minor traumas,'' are considered as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describing ``first aid uses'' and are adequately covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling provided for ``first aid antiseptics'' in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.50(b) (56 FR 33677), which contains the following: ``First 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid to help'' (select one of the following: ``prevent,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(``decrease'' (``the risk of'' or ``the chance of'')), (``reduce'' (``the risk of'' or ``the chance of'')), ``guard
against,'' or ``protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against'') (select one of the following: ``infection,'' ``bacterial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination,'' or ``skin infection'') ``in minor cuts, scrapes, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burns.'' The agency believes that the first aid indication is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiently broad to cover minute cuts and abrasions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shaving and that it is not necessary to include the words ``other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minor traumas'' in the indications statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beyond the first aid uses described in the first comment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency recognizes a need for an OTC ``antiseptic handwash'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product for repeated or daily use over an extended period of time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for some of the other uses described by the comment. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agrees with the comments that health-care personnel handwashes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are appropriate for such use because submitted data from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness studies, for uses subject to this rulemaking, were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derived from handwashing tests similar to or the same as tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in the agency's previously proposed testing guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see 43 FR 1210 at 1240), i.e., ``Modified Cade Procedure,'' ``Glove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Juice Test,'' and ``Test for Health-Care Personnel Handwash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effectiveness.'' The agency is proposing in this tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph in &sect;333.455(a) that a health-care personnel handwash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can also bear a statement of identity of ``antiseptic handwash.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See section I.B., comment 3.) For products labeled for multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses including both antiseptic handwash and first aid labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims, the general statement of identity would be ``antiseptic'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described in section I.B., comment 3. The product would then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to incorporate the monograph labeling for both antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwash as well as first aid antiseptic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``cleanser'' included in claims requested by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments is not appropriate in this rulemaking because it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be a cosmetic claim in view of the fact that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) defines a cosmetic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as ``articles intended to be *&blank;*&blank;* applied to the human body *&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for cleansing *&blank;*&blank;*'' (21 U.S.C. 321(i)(1)) and thus may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misleading to consumers. As discussed in section I.I., comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19, the terms ``microbicidal'' and ``germicidal'' may appear in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling of OTC antiseptic drug products under certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the agency is proposing as the indication for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products bearing the statement of identity ``antiseptic handwash'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a general claim similar to one recommended by one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, i.e., ``for handwashing to decrease bacteria on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin.'' The agency has determined that this claim may, at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's option, be followed by one or more of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following examples: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after assisting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under medical care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or treatment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Descriptive statements such as ``contains antibacterial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients'' and ``for the purpose of promoting good individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and family hygiene'' are considered to be examples of statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not significantly related to the safe and effective use of the product and thus are outside the scope of the rulemaking.
Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements may be included in the labeling of these OTC drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products subject to the statutory provisions against false or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misleading labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined that the indication proposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic handwash drug products is also appropriate for health-care personnel handwashes and is also proposing
the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication for health-care personnel handwashes. ``For handwashing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to decrease bacteria on the skin'' (which may be followed by one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or more of the following: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assisting ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical care or treatment.'') In addition to the indication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed above, the agency is proposing that health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel handwashes may also bear the following indication: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Handwash to help reduce bacteria that potentially can cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease.'' The agency is proposing the statement ``recommended for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeated use'' as an ``other allowable indication'' for antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or health-care personnel handwash drug products (see below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency sees no reason to continue to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``antimicrobial soap'' as a separate product category. Soap is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered to be a dosage form, and specific dosage forms are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being included in the monograph unless there is a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety or efficacy reason for doing so. Antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients may be formulated as soaps for some of the uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in this document, e.g., handwash; however, the designation ``antimicrobial soap'' is no longer being
proposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion in the monograph. In addition, the agency considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the other product categories that are being proposed to be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informative to the users of these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the comments, the agency is proposing labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for professional or consumer uses as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product as an ``antiseptic,'' as stated above under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.450(a), and/or ``antiseptic handwash,'' or ``health-care

The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling of the product may also contain the following phrase: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Recommended for repeated use.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other labeling claims requested by the comments for first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid antiseptics are not being included in the tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph. The agency believes that the general claim ``for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwashing to decrease bacteria on the skin'' encompasses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variety of uses for promoting good individual and family hygiene. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency tentatively concludes that the labeling statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed above express the same concepts as the labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested by the comments in language that can be more readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. One comment objected to a portion of the definition for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash in &sect;333.3(d) of the tentative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final monograph that states that the antimicrobial agent is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``broad-spectrum'' and ``if possible, persistent.'' The comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argued that, because these handwashes are used 50 to 100 times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily, persistence of effect is unnecessary. The comment also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questioned the need for a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, stating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Staphylococcus epidermidis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. epidermidis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) generally is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only natural resident bacteria on the skin, and other transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
micro-organisms are more likely to be removed mechanically by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washing than by antimicrobial action. The comment suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the choice to use or not to use a broad-spectrum antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient should be left to the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment pointed out that the requirement for ``broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spectrum'' activity is inconsistently applied in the definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, and surgical hand scrub (&sect;333.3(d), (e), and (i), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively) because ``broad spectrum'' activity is mandatory for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first two classes and only ``desirable'' for surgical hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrubs. The comment cited comment 93 (43 FR 1210 at 1224) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the testing guidelines for safety and effectiveness of OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical antimicrobials (43 FR 1239) to show the agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
awareness of possible shifts in microbial flora due to a lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broad spectrum activity. The comment urged that all three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product classes include the requirement for each product to at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least demonstrate in vitro ``cidal'' activity against gram-negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteria, fungi, and lipophilic and hydrophilic viruses in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to the gram-positive activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;333.3(d) of the previous tentative final monograph, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash was defined as an ``*&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial-containing preparation designed for frequent use; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it reduces the number of transient micro-organisms on intact skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an initial baseline level after adequate washing, rinsing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drying, and it is broad-spectrum, fast acting, and, if possible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persistent.'' In the tentative final monograph, the agency agreed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Panel that persistence, defined as prolonged activity, is a valuable attribute that assures antimicrobial
activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the interval between washings and is important to a safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and effective health-care personnel handwash (43 FR 1215). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panel explained that a property such as persistence, which acts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent the growth or establishment of transient micro-organisms as part of the normal baseline or resident flora,
would be an added benefit (39 FR 33103 at 33115). Although the Panel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did not propose persistence as a mandatory requirement for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash, the agency is retaining the words 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``if possible, persistent'' in the definition in this amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative final monograph because this is a desirable trait for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the comment's objection to the broad-spectrum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement, the Panel in its discussion of the normal skin flora 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the predominant members of the normal flora are gram 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive cocci and diptheroids and not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. epidermidis,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment indicates. The Panel stated further that a small number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of gram negative species, such as coliforms and related micro-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organisms, as well as higher forms such as yeast may also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents of the skin of healthy individuals (39 FR 33103 at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33107). In its discussion of health-care personnel handwash drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, the Panel acknowledged that, in all likelihood, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified effect of these products (i.e., removal of transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
micro-organisms) can be achieved with a well formulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonantimicrobial soap or detergent product. However, the Panel concluded that transient micro-organisms may become
part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established ``resident'' flora with time, and stated that in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care situation, the fast, effective removal of transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
micro-organisms is a requirement because they may be pathogenic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(39 FR 33103 at 33115). The Panel recommended that health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel handwash drug products containing an antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient should be broad spectrum. The Panel defined ``broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spectrum'' in reference to microbiological activity as meaning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial has activity against more than one type of micro-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organism, that is, activity against gram positive and gram 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative bacteria, fungi, and viruses (39 FR 33115). Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transient micro-organisms present on the skin may include widely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diverse species, resulting from contact with contaminated persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and materials, the agency concludes that a greater reduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transient micro-organisms on the skin can be achieved if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial containing drug product used as a health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel handwash provides broad spectrum activity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, because the principal intended use of these professional use products is the prevention of nosocomial
(hospital acquired) infections, the agency believes that these drug products should have demonstrable antimicrobial
activity against a microbial spectrum that includes the micro-organisms associated with these infections. As discussed
in section I.N., comment 28, the agency is proposing, in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii) of the testing requirements, a
list of micro-organisms that reflects a spectrum of antimicrobial activity pertinent to the intended use of these
drug products and against which the products must be tested. The agency is proposing the following definition of broad
spectrum activity in &sect;333.403(b) of this amended tentative final monograph: ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Broad spectrum activity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A properly formulated drug product, containing an ingredient included in the monograph, that possesses in vitro
activity against the micro-organisms listed in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii), as demonstrated by in vitro minimum inhibitory
concentration determinations conducted according to methodology in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii).'' This methodology
has been developed by the National Committee for Clinical Standards (NCCLS) (Ref. 1). Although micro-organisms
in addition to those listed may also be used for testing, the agency will use the test micro-organisms identified in
&sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii) for any necessary compliance testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency wants to emphasize that in this amended tentative final monograph the broad-spectrum criterion applies
to final-formulated drug products used as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative
skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub. Although the Category I active ingredients currently included in this
amended tentative final monograph are broad spectrum independent of formulation, some Category III antiseptic
ingredients have limited spectra (activity against only gram positive bacteria; for example, chloroxylenol (see
section I.G., comment 12) and triclosan (see section I.L., comment 23)), but when properly formulated in a final product
the spectrum can be broadened to include additional activity against the test micro-organisms, thereby possibly
enabling these ingredients to become Category I. Although the agency agrees with the first comment that the manufacturer
may use or not use a broad-spectrum ingredient in a particular health-care antiseptic drug product, the finished
product must demonstrate in vitro activity against the specific micro-organisms listed in proposed &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the second comment, that broad spectrum was inconsistently applied in the definitions of the three
product classes, the agency has reevaluated the issue and believes that all product classes should be broad spectrum.
As stated in the tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1212), maintaining the balance among species of micro-organisms
constituting the normal skin flora is more likely to be threatened by use of antimicrobial products with a limited
spectrum. Also much of the data concerning the spread of infections in hospitals indicates that the use of an antimicrobial
with broad spectrum activity would help prevent this (see section I.D., comment 9). Based on the reasons mentioned
above, the agency is proposing to include ``broad spectrum'' in the definitions of the three product classes included
in this tentative final monograph.

7. Several comments contended that FDA does not have the authority to restrict OTC labeling claims to exact wording,
to the exclusion of what the comments described as other ``equally truthful claims for the products.'' One comment
pointed out that numerous other meaningful and truthful statements will provide useful information and will enhance
the safe and effective use of these products. Several comments maintained that manufacturers have a constitutional
right to use any truthful, nonmisleading labeling under the first amendment. To support their position, the comments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258), the agency published a final rule changing its labeling policy for stating the indications
for use of OTC drug products. Under 21 CFR 330.1(c)(2), the label and labeling of OTC drug products are required to contain
in a prominent and conspicuous location, either (1) the specific wording on indications for use established under
an OTC drug monograph, which may appear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES''; (2) other wording describing
such indications for use that meets the statutory prohibitions against false or misleading labeling, which shall
neither appear within a boxed area nor be designated ``APPROVED USES''; or (3) the approved monograph language on
indications, which may appear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES,'' plus alternative language describing
indications for use that is not false or misleading, which shall appear elsewhere in the labeling. All other OTC drug
labeling required by a monograph or other regulation (e.g., statement of identity, warnings, and directions) must
appear in the specific wording established under the OTC drug monograph or other regulation where exact language
has been established and identified by quotation marks, e.g., 21 CFR 201.63 or 330.1(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the previous tentative final monograph, supplemental language relating to indications had been proposed and
captioned as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Allowable Statements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in &sect;&sect;333.85, 333.87 and 333.97. Under FDA's revised labeling policy (51 FR 16258), such statements are
included at the tentative final stage as examples of other truthful and nonmisleading language that would be allowed
elsewhere in the labeling. In accordance with the revised labeling policy, such statements would not be included
in a final monograph.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In preparing this amended tentative final monograph, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency has reevaluated these ``other allowable statements'' to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether they should be incorporated, wherever possible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of the indications developed under the monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Allowable Statements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in the previous tentative final monograph in &sect;333.85 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for health-care personnel handwash, in &sect;333.87 for patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparation, and in &sect;333.97 for surgical hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrub. The statement ``recommended for repeated use'' proposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a health-care personnel handwash has been included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended tentative final monograph as an ``other allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication'' in proposed &sect;333.455 for antiseptic handwash or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash drug products. (See section I.B., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment 5.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms ``broad spectrum'' and ``fast-acting'' (if applicable) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were proposed as ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Allowable Statements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' for all three of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these product classes in the previous tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in section I.C., comment 6, the agency is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to include ``broad spectrum'' in the definition of the three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product classes included in this amended tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph. Although the term ``broad spectrum'' is included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definitions of these product classes, the agency does not see a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to include this information in the ``indications'' for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. Likewise, the term ``fast-acting'' is included in the definitions of these product classes, but the agency
does not see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a need to include this information in the indications for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. This type of information may appear elsewhere in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling of these products as additional information to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care professional, provided it does not appear in any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the labeling required by the monograph and does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detract from such required information. Other previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Allowable Statements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' i.e., ``contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antibacterial ingredient(s),'' ``contains antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient(s),'' and ``nonirritating,'' are not related in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant way to the safe and effective use of these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency does not believe that statements such as ``contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antibacterial ingredient(s)'' or ``contains antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient(s)'' are necessary on products intended primarily for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health professionals, but has no objection to such statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appearing in the labeling as other information not intertwined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any portion of the labeling required by the monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Likewise, the term ``nonirritating'' may appear as additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to the health-care professional, provided it does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appear in any portion of the labeling required by the monograph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and does not detract from such required information. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such statements are subject to the provisions of section 502 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the act (21 U.S.C. 352) relating to labeling that is false or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misleading. Such statements will be evaluated on a product-by- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product basis, under the provisions of section 502 of the act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to labeling that is false or misleading.

8. Several comments requested that certain warnings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required in the labeling of OTC drug products marketed for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general public should not be required on such products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributed only to health professionals and labeled primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for use in health-care facilities as in proposed &sect;333.99 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Professional labeling'' (43 FR 1210 at 1248 and 1249). Examples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited were the cautionary statements for ``skin antiseptic'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``skin wound protectant'' in proposed &sect;&sect;333.90(c)(3) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
333.93(c)(3) ``Do not use this product for more than 10 days. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the infection (condition) worsens or persists, see your 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician,'' and for ``skin wound protectant'' in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.93(c)(7) ``Do not use on chronic skin conditions such as leg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ulcers, diaper rash, or hand eczema.'' The comments stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the professional use of these products sometimes differs from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer use and that products which are marketed only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care institutions and are dispensed and administered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professionals should only contain warnings that apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional use. One comment concluded that requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional labeling to contain a caution such as in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.93(c)(7) could possibly subject the health-care facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the physician to unwarranted product liability claims, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although the particular use of the product under medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervision is entirely justified and necessary for proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of the patient. One of the comments stated that flexibility should be provided so that manufacturers can
utilize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only those warnings that are appropriate for professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel when packages are restricted to health-care facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or where a topical antimicrobial product is used as part of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of treatment selected by the clinician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 12, 1973 (38 FR 31260), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency published the tentative final monograph for OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antacid drug products, in which the concept of ethical labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for OTC drug products was first discussed in comment 56 at 38 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31264. There, the agency stated that the warning statements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appearing on OTC drug products should be included in ethical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(professional) labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, in the previous tentative final monograph for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTC topical antimicrobial drug products, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1978 (43 FR 1210), the agency proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.99 (``Professional labeling'') which stated that the labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of products (covered by the monograph) that is provided only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health professionals and the labeling for those products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily used in health-care facilities shall include all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warnings required in each subsection of the monograph, e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those in &sect;333.90 for ``skin antiseptic'' or &sect;333.93 for ``skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wound protectant.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in the first aid antiseptic segment of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative final monograph for OTC antimicrobial drug products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency has proposed deletion of the categories cited by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, i.e., ``skin antiseptic'' and ``skin wound protectant,'' as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate drug categories and included them in a single drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product category identified as ``first aid antiseptic.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cautionary statements referred to by the comments are addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in that document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this document, the agency is addressing the uses other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than first-aid, i.e., health-care antiseptic uses, of topical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial drug products. These products may contain the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic active ingredient(s) as the first aid antiseptic drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, but they are labeled and marketed for different uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cautionary statements previously proposed in &sect;&sect;333.90(c)(3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 333.93(c)(3) addressed short-term first aid uses of products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily proposed as ``consumer products.'' These products were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not principally intended to be marketed for hospital or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional use. Therefore, the agency agrees with the comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that such cautionary statements do not apply to professional use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of antiseptic drug products and need not appear in the labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of antiseptic products marketed as antiseptic handwashes or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparations, and surgical hand scrubs. Likewise the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that health-care antiseptic drug products, marketed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principally to health-care professionals, do not need to bear a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cautionary statement not to use the product on chronic skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions such as leg ulcers, diaper rash, or hand eczema. As the comment pointed out, professional use of these products
is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different than consumer use and, in some instances, use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product on the above-mentioned skin conditions under medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervision may be justified and necessary for proper treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the patient. Therefore, this cautionary statement is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being included in this tentative final monograph.

This tentative final monograph addresses specifically the use of these topical antiseptic drug products by health-care
professionals and in health-care facilities. The labeling proposed for those products in this document represents
that labeling which the agency believes health-care professionals need to properly use these products. Therefore,
the agency believes that the warnings proposed in &sect;333.450(c) of this tentative final monograph should appear
in the labeling of these products that are directed to health-care professionals and health-care facilities, even
if the product is marketed principally to these sources only. However, the agency believes that one of these warnings
can be modified if the product is labeled ``For Hospital and Professional Use Only.'' In such cases, the second sentence
of the warning proposed in &sect;333.450(c)(3), regarding consulting a doctor, can be deleted. This concept is being
included in this tentative final monograph. (See &sect;333.450(d).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In responding to the comments regarding the warnings in the ``Professional labeling'' section (&sect;333.99) of
the previous tentative final monograph, the agency has determined that these warnings are no longer necessary. Accordingly,
&sect;333.99 is not being included in this amended tentative final monograph. (See section I.D., comment 9 for discussion
of &sect;333.99(a), and section I.J., comment 21 for discussion of &sect;333.99(b). Also, see section II.B., paragraph
14 in the first aid antiseptic segment of this tentative final monograph (56 FR 33644 at 33675) for discussion of &sect;333.99(c).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Several comments made recommendations regarding the requirement that professional labeling for all classes
of OTC topical antimicrobial drug products must contain the caution statement in proposed &sect;333.99(a), ``Caution:
Overuse of this and other antimicrobial products may result in an overgrowth of gram-negative micro-organisms,
particularly 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' Some of the comments stated that this caution statement should be required only for antimicrobials where there
is valid scientific evidence to show that such caution is appropriate, for example, quaternary ammonium compounds
and triclosan, which have been associated with the overgrowth of gram-negative micro-organisms, specifically

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Three comments contended that reports of contamination of benzalkonium chloride solutions with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Enterobacteria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 species were basically the result of misuse, improper storage and dilution, poor technique, and contamination with
neutralizing chemicals. One comment recommended that the proposed caution statement in &sect;333.99(a) should
be changed to read: ``Improper use or overuse *&blank;*&blank;*.'' and cited the discussion of the proposed warning
for quaternary ammonium compounds by the agency at 43 FR 1237 where the phrase ``misuse or overuse'' was included.
Another comment objected to the caution, arguing that it is based on theoretical considerations only and there is
no published clinical evidence implicating quaternary ammonium compounds. Still another comment stated that its
quaternary ammonium compound product passed the commonly used test for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In defense of triclosan's implication in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 overgrowth, one comment argued that overgrowth was just an unproven hypothesis and submitted the ``Summary for Basis
of Approval'' from an approved new drug application (NDA) for chlorhexidine gluconate (Ref. 1) which included data
on a skin flora study that indicated an increasing, continuous gram-negative growth only in the axillary area over
a 6-month period, even though chlorhexidine is active against gram-negative micro-organisms. The comment referred
to FDA's Division of Anti-Infective Drug Products as having recognized that gram-negative overgrowth can be adequately
controlled by restricting use to indications provided in the labeling of a product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments pointed out that data on povidone-iodine have proven broad spectrum effectiveness, referring
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) recommendation (Ref. 2) for using this ingredient for skin
preparation before intravenous catheter insertion and other procedures to reduce infection. The comments also
noted that in a study by Houang et al. (Ref. 3), in which 20 transfers of 7 gram-negative micro-organisms (including

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)) were made, the minimum inhibitory concentration did not change, supporting the fact that repeated use of povidone-iodine
would not result in resistant micro-organisms. For these reasons, these comments recommended that &sect;333.99(a)
should be revised to exclude povidone-iodine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a thorough review and evaluation of the available data, the agency concludes that the professional labeling
caution that overuse of an antimicrobial drug product may cause an overgrowth of gram-negative micro-organisms
is not necessary. In the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1212), the agency stated its awareness of
the theory that gram-negative bacteria will replace gram-positive bacteria that are reduced in number or eliminated
by use of antimicrobials and encouraged research to test the validity of the theory. The agency also recalled the Panel's
highlighting the need for research on microbial ecology of the skin and its concern about the effect of overuse of antimicrobial
drug products, especially products with a limited spectrum, in hospitals and other closed populations. Therefore,
the agency proposed the professional labeling caution in &sect;333.99(a) ``for certain antimicrobial ingredients
approved for OTC drug use *&blank;*&blank;* used in health-care facilities'' (43 FR 1213). However, the agency concluded
that the limited consumer use of these products in the population at large did not constitute a risk that would warrant
such a label warning. Although benzalkonium chloride has been frequently implicated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 hospital infections, the agency's review of numerous reports and studies on quaternary ammonium compounds and other
antimicrobials (Refs. 4 through 10) indicates that specific causes for contamination, such as lack of aseptic technique
when applying intravenous infusions and sterilization failure of the items used (bottles, tubing, distilled water
used in diluting benzalkonium chloride), were the problem and not overuse of benzalkonium chloride. The agency discussed
this problem in the previous tentative final monograph and stated that it appears that practices in the health-care
facility environments where quaternary ammonium compounds are commonly used often fall short of the minimum necessary
to prevent outbreaks of infection. (See comment 51 43 FR 1210 at 1218.) Benzalkonium chloride is more prone to become
contaminated for several reasons that were brought out in the studies: (1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 species are among the bacteria most resistant to surface-active agents like quaternary ammonium compounds. (2)
The usual quaternary ammonium compound concentration appears to be ineffective against some species, such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas cepacia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, an organism which has been reported to have been associated with hospital infections. One study showed that this
organism survived 14 years in a salt solution preserved with 0.05 percent benzalkonium chloride. (3) Organic materials
(gauze, cotton, cork in stoppers, soaps), inorganic matter, protein, and anionic substances inactivate quaternary
ammonium compounds. (4) Hospital personnel are unfamiliar with these problems and with procedures for using quaternary
ammonium compounds safely and effectively. Based on these reports, the agency agrees with the comments that ``improper''
use, not ``overuse,'' is the cause of benzalkonium chloride being implicated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contamination and that there is a lack of data demonstrating ``overuse'' to be the cause.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency also agrees with the comment which stated that it was an unproven hypothesis that overuse of an antiseptic
causes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 overgrowth. The ``Summary for Basis of Approval'' from an approved NDA for chlorhexidine gluconate (Ref. 1) cites
a skin flora study that indicated that the axilla was an area where gram-negative micro-organisms continued to be
isolated even though chlorhexidine gluconate has shown gram-negative effectiveness. The comment cited FDA's Division
of Anti-Infective Drug Products' recognition that for health-care uses, such as surgical scrub and health-care
personnel handwash, there would be no problem with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 overgrowth because the hands are an area of the body not likely to support the growth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because of the lack of moisture. In defending triclosan, the comment contended that this ingredient is bacteriostatic
and does not eliminate all gram-positive bacteria; therefore, it would not predispose for gram-negative overgrowth.
Triclosan has been implicated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contamination because it is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria, has limited in vitro and in vivo
activity against gram-negative bacteria, and no activity against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (43 FR 1210 at 1232). One report showed that triclosan was effective against some gram-negative micro-organisms,
but not effective against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Serratia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 11). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 resistance caused the contamination, not overuse of the antiseptic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees with the comments that quaternary ammonium compounds and triclosan have been implicated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 hospital infections more frequently than povidone-iodine, but studies indicate that `overuse' of these or any antimicrobial
has not been the cause. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 species may become dominant because of inherent resistant factors which enable them to survive the effects of many
antibiotics and antiseptics (Refs. 12, 13, and 14). In addition, this genus is ubiquitous, found in both soil and water,
and can multiply in almost any moist environment with even a trace of organic material (Ref. 15). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that the data and reports have not provided specific evidence that repeated use of health-care
antiseptics, including benzalkonium chloride and triclosan, have brought about overgrowth of gram-negative bacteria,
particularly 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The agency agrees with the comments that improper use, failure of hospital personnel to use according to labeling
indications, nonaseptic technique in diluting and handling, and lack of good quality control to ensure sterility
of items in contact with antiseptics, such as sterile distilled water, hosing, and receptacles, are responsible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study by Houang et al. (Ref. 3) shows that repeated in vitro exposure of seven gram-negative micro-organisms,
including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. aeruginosa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in povidone-iodine dilutions did not result in the development of resistance. The agency notes that CDC previously
recommended povidone-iodine for use in intravenous catheter and other procedures (Ref. 2). However, there has been
one report from CDC (Ref. 16) which described 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 hospital infections caused by intrinsically contaminated povidone-iodine (contaminated during manufacture,
indicating failure of control of microbiological contamination). Compliance with the agency's regulations governing
current good manufacturing practice for finished pharmaceuticals (21 CFR part 211) should prevent intrinsic contamination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the agency concludes that a cautionary statement against overuse is not needed in the professional
labeling of health-care antiseptic drug products. Therefore, the previously proposed caution in &sect;333.99(a)
is not being included in this tentative final monograph. If new information indicates a need for a cautionary statement,
the agency will consider appropriate action at that time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data on the safety and effectiveness of alcohol formulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an emolliented vehicle for use as a surgical hand scrub, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash, and hand degermer were submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Miscellaneous External Panel (Refs. 2 and 3). However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the data were not reviewed or categorized for these uses during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that rulemaking. In reviewing alcohol for short-term uses, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panel stated, ``ethyl alcohol acts relatively quickly to decrease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of micro-organisms on the skin surface. Each minute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that scrubbed hands and arms were immersed in approximately 77 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent ethyl alcohol by volume was found to be equivalent to 6.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minutes of scrubbing in water; if the skin was scrubbed with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol, the rate was further increased'' (47 FR 22324 at 22328). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Panel found ethyl alcohol safe and effective for use as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical antimicrobial preparation in concentrations of 60 to 95 percent by volume in an aqueous solution. The following

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indications were proposed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ``For first aid use to decrease germs in minor cuts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrapes.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ``To decrease germs on the skin prior to removing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splinter or other foreign object.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) ``For preparation of the skin prior to an injection.'' (See the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC alcohol
drug products for topical antimicrobial use, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of May 21, 1982, 47 FR 22324.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submissions (Refs. 1 and 2) included effectiveness data and labeling for a currently marketed product containing
62 percent ethyl alcohol formulated in an emolliented vehicle and dispensed as a foam used ``*&blank;*&blank;* to
degerm hands *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The agency has reviewed these data, derived from effectiveness testing as a surgical
hand scrub (glove juice test) and health-care personnel handwash, and finds that they meet the procedures in the testing
guidelines in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1242). Statistical analyses showed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbial reduction to be highly significant. A glove juice test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showed that alcohol foam reduced the baseline number of bacteria present in normal skin flora, after first use, by
1.87 logs, and, after continued use for 5 days, by 2.36 logs. The reduction of the baseline number of bacteria was maintained
for up to 6 hours under surgical gloves. A health-care personnel handwash effectiveness test showed microbial reduction
on test subjects' hands, artificially contaminated with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Serratia marcescens 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. marcescens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Microbial reduction averaged 3.3 logs after 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatments and 3.63 logs after 25 treatments. In vitro data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derived from studies using 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. marcescens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as the test bacteria, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showed that alcohol properly formulated in an emolliented vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and dispensed as a foam, significantly reduced the number of test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteria, in 10 percent serum, within 15 seconds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these data and the conclusions of the Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
External Panel (47 FR 22324), the agency concludes that alcohol, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when properly formulated, is effective for use as a surgical hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrub and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because it is well established that alcohol alone does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide persistence, the agency notes that a preservative agent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the vehicle provided the persistent effect to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in the baseline number of bacteria for 6 hours as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to demonstrate efficacy as a surgical hand scrub drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is including alcohol in proposed &sect;333.410(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.412(a) (patient preoperative skin preparation), and &sect;333.414(a) (surgical hand scrub), as follows:
``Alcohol 60 to 95 percent by volume in an aqueous solution denatured according to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
regulations in 27 CFR part 20.'' Further, the agency finds the Miscellaneous External Panel's proposed Category
I indication for OTC alcohol drug products, i.e., ``for preparation of the skin prior to an injection'' to be an appropriate
indication for patient preoperative skin preparation drug products. Based on that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panel's recommendations, the agency is including this indication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an additional claim for alcohol drug products in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.460(b)(2) of the proposed monograph. In addition, based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Panel's similar recommendations for isopropyl alcohol (47 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22324 at 22329 and 22332), the agency is proposing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication for OTC isopropyl alcohol drug products in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.460(b)(3). As discussed in section I.N., comment 28, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is proposing new effectiveness criteria for drug products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeled for this use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The monograph will also state that an alcohol drug product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be properly formulated, such as the product in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emolliented vehicle dispensed as a foam discussed above, to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test requirements in &sect;333.470. This means that alcohol when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended for certain uses must be able to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness by certain tests proposed in this tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph, as follows: (1) Antiseptic or health-care personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwash_&sect;333.470(b)(2), (2) patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation_&sect;333.470(b) (3), and (3) surgical hand scrub_&sect;333.470(b)(1). As discussed in section
I.B., comment 5, the term ``antiseptic handwash'' in lieu of ``hand degermer'' is being proposed in the monograph
as the statement of identity for this type of product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The labeling for the alcohol product (Ref. 1) provides directions for use without water rinsing, where water is not
readily available, as follows: ``A `palmful' (5 grams) is dispensed in one hand. It is spread on both hands and rubbed
into the skin until dry (approximately 1 to 2 minutes). A smaller amount (2.5 grams) is then dispensed into one hand,
spread over both hands to wrist, and rubbed into the skin until dry (approximately 30 seconds).'' The agency concurs
with these directions and is incorporating them into its proposed directions for use for OTC topical antiseptic drug
products, including alcohol, formulated for use without water in this tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph. See proposed &sect;333.455(c) and &sect;333.465(c).

11. Several comments requested that the agency include chlorhexidine gluconate as a Category I ingredient in any
amended tentative final monograph. The comments submitted references and data to establish general recognition
of safety and effectiveness (Ref. 1), and stated that chlorhexidine gluconate solution is recognized in the ``British
Pharmacopeia'' (Ref. 2) and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulated in a wide range of products that have been successfully marketed to a material extent and for a material
length of time in other countries. The comments asserted that when formulated in compliance with FDA's current good

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing practice regulations (21 CFR part 211), chlorhexidine products are safe and effective for use as skin
wound cleansers, skin wound protectants, patient preoperative skin preparations, skin antiseptics, surgical
hand scrubs, and health-care personnel handwashes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A reply comment argued that chlorhexidine gluconate, currently marketed in the United States under approved new
drug applications (NDA's), is not eligible for an OTC drug monograph because the ingredient has not been marketed
within this country to a material extent and for a material length of time. The comment added that variations in final
formulations may alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety and effectiveness of the ingredient. The comment submitted data (Ref. 3) to support this viewpoint and requested
that chlorhexidine gluconate be classified in Category II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210), chlorhexidine gluconate (4 percent solution) was neither
addressed nor categorized as Category I, II, or III. However, subsequent to the tentative final monograph, the agency
granted a petition (Ref. 4) and in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 9, 1979, reopened the administrative record to allow interested persons an opportunity to submit data and
information (44 FR 13041). The comments (Ref. 1) and reply comment (Ref. 2) were submitted in response to that notice.
However, since that time a majority of the comments on chlorhexidine submitted in response to the notice have been
withdrawn (Ref. 5). While the withdrawn comments remain on public display as part of the administrative record, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are no longer being considered in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the marketing history of chlorhexidine gluconate and finds that although it has been marketed
for professional or hospital use under NDA's, insufficient data remain in the public administrative record for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rulemaking to support general recognition of safety and effectiveness for OTC use. Accordingly, chlorhexidine
gluconate 4 percent aqueous solution as a health-care antiseptic is a new drug and is not included in this tentative
final monograph.

G. Comments on Chloroxylenol

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. A number of comments disagreed with the agency's Category III classification of chloroxylenol in the tentative
final monograph. They argued that a reevaluation of the data previously submitted to the agency along with new data
that have been submitted (Refs. 1 through 16) would provide adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justification for classifying chloroxylenol in Category I for safety and effectiveness for use in antimicrobial
soaps, health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative skin preparations, skin antiseptics, skin wound
cleansers, skin wound protectants, and surgical hand scrubs. Several comments pointed out that the Antimicrobial
II Panel unanimously concluded that chloroxylenol is generally recognized as safe for topical use in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
athlete's foot and jock-itch preparations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the submitted data (Refs. 1 through 16) and other information reviewed by the Antimicrobial Panels, the
agency concluded in the amended tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products that chloroxylenol
(0.24 percent to 3.75 percent) was safe but not effective for short-term use as an OTC topical first aid antiseptic
(54 FR 33644 at 33658). These data (Refs. 1 through 16) and new data submitted under the agency's ``feedback'' procedures
(Refs. 17 through 30) are insufficient to support a Category I classification of the safety and effectiveness of the
ingredient for other long-term uses, e.g., antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and surgical
hand scrub. The agency concludes that chloroxylenol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains classified in Category III as an active ingredient for these uses. However, the ingredient would be considered
safe for short-term use as a patient preoperative skin preparation but remains in Category III due to a lack of effectiveness
data for this use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1222 and 1238), the agency stated that the data were insufficient
to reclassify chloroxylenol into Category I, and the ingredient remained in Category III for safety and effectiveness.
Indicating concern about the absorption of topically applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial drug products used repeatedly by consumers over a number of years, the agency stated the following
regarding the safety of the ingredient:

Only the most superficial toxicity data in animals were submitted to and reviewed by the Panel. The Commissioner concurs
with the Panel that toxicity in rodent and nonrodent species, substantivity, blood levels, distribution and metabolism,
as well as any subsequent systemic absorption studies must be characterized *&blank;*&blank;*. The degree of absorption
of PCMX following topical administration has not been established. The target organ for PCMX toxicity in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals also remains unidentified and should be shown in a long-term animal toxicity study.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While safety data (Refs. 1, 2, 6, and 7) are sufficient to establish safety for short-term use such as for a patient preoperative
skin preparation drug product, these data do not resolve concerns about long-term chronic toxicity. Conclusions
on these data, which were also reviewed by the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Antimicrobial II Drug Products (Antimicrobial
II Panel) in conjunction with its review of OTC topical antifungal drug products, were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 23, 1982 (47 FR 12480). That Panel, which evaluated the safety of the ingredient for use in OTC topical antifungal
drug products, categorized chloroxylenol (0.5 to 3.75 percent) as safe (Category I) for short-term use (up to 13 weeks)
and advised, ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;relatively low doses of chloroxylenol can be systemically tolerated,
at least over a 13-week period. The Panel is concerned about the effect of chronic administration on the liver, but
does not consider that topical application of chloroxylenol to small areas of the skin over short periods of time would
result in liver damage.'' (47 FR 12480 at 12534). The agency subsequently agreed with the Panel's conclusions concerning
the safety of using the ingredient in OTC topical antifungal drug products for the treatment of athlete's foot, jock
itch, and ringworm (maximum treatment duration 4 weeks) in its tentative final monograph for these OTC drug products,
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 12, 1989 (54 FR 51136 at 51139). The agency subsequently finalized these conclusions in the final rule
for OTC topical antifungal drug products published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 23, 1993 (58 FR 49890). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding long-term chronic toxicity, data and information provided by one manufacturer included final reports
of completed studies and interim reports of incomplete studies (Ref. 2). The information also contained a protocol
of a planned preclinical study (projected starting and completion dates for experiments) which identified a 2-year
rat feeding study. Because this study might resolve concerns about long-term chronic toxicity, the agency requested
the raw data (Ref. 31); however, the manufacturer declined to submit the data, explaining that it is no longer interested
in marketing chloroxylenol, that its study had not been completed, and that the study was conducted prior to establishment
of the Good Laboratory Practices regulations (Ref. 32). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the agency's determination that data from a 2-year rat feeding study were essential (Ref. 33), another
manufacturer submitted additional information along with copies of already available safety data (Ref. 34). The
manufacturer explained that it believes that long-term safety data, i.e., 2-year oral feeding study, while not currently
available, may not be a necessity. Citing statements made by the Panel, that its recommended guidelines for the safety
testing of these drug products were developed primarily for antimicrobial agents applied to the entire body surface
and that appropriate tests should be chosen to reflect the intended use of the antimicrobial drug product (39 FR 33103
at 33135), the manufacturer contended that the guidelines were developed to address the most extreme exposure to
an antimicrobial ingredient rather than to describe the minimal requirements for safety data that the Panel would
find acceptable. Noting the contrast between the use of surgical hand scrub drug products (products used by adults
in a limited area of the body for a specified time span) with lifetime application to the entire body in bar soaps, the
manufacturer contended that while the use of a surgical hand scrub is considered chronic use, the exposure to the antimicrobial
ingredient during such use is limited to the hand and half the distance to the elbow. The manufacturer further suggested
that one might simply regard the use of health-care antiseptic ingredients in handwashes and surgical scrubs as repeated
daily use in a limited area of the body. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturer contended that data from a 2-year feeding study would not contribute any information on the long-term
safety of chloroxylenol that is not already available from subchronic studies (Ref. 35). In support of its contention,
the manufacturer submitted data from subchronic animal toxicity and human bathing studies (Ref. 18) previously
submitted in response to the tentative final monograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products and to the Antimicrobial
II Panel. The data also included computer simulation models (Ref. 36) of plasma levels of chloroxylenol that might
occur after dermal applications of varying concentrations of the ingredient. The simulations, based on urinary
excretion data from human bathing studies, predict a lack of potential for accumulation of the ingredient in humans.
Subsequent submissions from the same manufacturer included a review article on the toxicity of chloroxylenol (Ref.
19), a retrospective analysis of the value of chronic animal toxicology studies of pharmaceutical compounds (Ref.
20), and copies of all available toxicity data for chloroxylenol (Ref. 21). Included in the toxicity data was a kinetic
analysis (Ref. 37) of data from human and animal studies of the ingredient previously submitted to the agency that
also predicts that accumulation in humans is not likely to occur at reasonable exposure levels. Based on the above
data and information, the manufacturer requested that the agency reconsider the necessity of a long-term animal
study. In response to the manufacturer's request, a public meeting was held to discuss the available toxicity data
for chloroxylenol. At that meeting, the agency noted that many of the subchronic studies of the ingredient are of limited
usefulness because they were conducted using a formulated product that contained isopropyl alcohol, turpineols,
and castor oil soap in addition to chloroxylenol. The kinetic model used in the studies was considered inappropriate.
A one-compartment model, as used in the analysis, is not relevant to chloroxylenol due to its lipophilic nature. The
agency's detailed comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Refs. 38 and 39).

After considering the manufacturer's comments and evaluating the data available at the time, the agency concluded
that the information was not adequate to characterize the level of absorption, the distribution, the metabolism,
and the excretion of chloroxylenol following topical administration. In a 1988 letter to the manufacturer (Ref.
40), the agency stated: (1) That data from the human bathing studies reviewed are highly variable (absorption 0.5
to 15.7 percent), (2) the analytical methodology used in the studies had not been validated and (3) that the small number
of subjects included in the studies made it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the reported results. The
agency commented further that submitted accumulation predictions were not adequate to define the toxicity that
might occur with repeated exposure to the ingredient because no data have been submitted to support or validate the
model's assumptions in characterizing exposure and stated that additional data are needed to justify, support,
and verify the assumptions and data used in the predictions. Pointing out that accumulation is not the sole issue of
long-term toxicity, the agency asserted that long-term toxicity may be related to repeated daily exposure to low
levels of the ingredient over a lifetime. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In that same letter, the agency stated that it had reexamined the necessity for a long-term animal study based on the
manufacturer's assertion that use of the ingredient as an antiseptic handwash and surgical scrub should be regarded
as repeated use to a limited area of the body, and had concluded that data from additional short-term studies conducted
under actual use conditions (i.e., where abrasion is followed by occlusion, with the level of absorption, distribution,
metabolism, and elimination of the ingredient being shown under these conditions) could provide adequate information
to determine whether or not a long-term animal study is necessary. Protocols for a pharmacokinetic surgical scrub
study to develop such data were submitted to the agency (Refs. 41 and 42); however, to date the agency has not received
any data from such a study. The agency's detailed comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Refs. 43 and
44). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More recently, the agency received additional data pertaining to the safety of chloroxylenol from another manufacturer
(Ref. 30). The data included an assessment of the ingredient's mutagenic potential by a series of in vitro and in vivo
assays (Ames test, unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes, chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster
ovary cells, and an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay). The data also included a dose range-finding study for a teratology
study of the ingredient in rats and the subsequent teratology study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two of the four mutagenicity assays included in the submission yielded suspect or equivocal results. The in vitro
administration of 19, 38, 75, and 150 micrograms per milliliter (&mu;g/mL) doses of chloroxylenol to Chinese hamster
ovary cells produced a statistically significant increase relative to the solvent control in the mean number of chromosome
aberrations per cell at the 75 and 150 &mu;g/mL dose level both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.
Statistically significant increases in the percent of aberrant cells were also seen at the 75 &mu;g/mL dose in the
absence of metabolic activation and at the 75 and 150 &mu;g/mL doses in the presence of metabolic activation. No dose
response was apparent in either the activated or nonactivated systems. The investigator concluded that the results
were equivocal in the nonactivated test system and suspect in the activated test system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay demonstrated a statistically significant increase in micronucleated
polychromatic erythrocytes in female mice 24 and 72 hours after oral dosing with 250 and 833 milligrams per kilogram
(mg/kg) doses of chloroxylenol. However, no dose response was apparent. The investigator considered the results
to be a statistical anomaly based on unusually low mean micronucleus values in the negative control group and the lack
of a dose response. However, the agency believes that because the observed increases were significantly elevated
over those of the negative controls (p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 0.01) and were reproducible at two dose levels, these results should be considered equivocal. The manufacturer has
provided additional information (Ref. 45) in response to the agency's interpretation of the results of the mouse
micronucleus assay. However, the agency continues to believe that reliance on data from historical controls is inappropriate
and has not changed its position on the data. The agency's detailed comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch
(Refs. 46 and 47). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the new data (Ref. 30) and the issues that they raise, the agency has again reexamined the data requirements
necessary to support the safe chronic use of this ingredient. The agency finds it necessary to broaden the additional
testing requirements in order to clearly assess potential risks associated with chronic use of chloroxylenol. Therefore,
data obtained from the following are necessary: (1) Human studies conducted under maximal use conditions, i.e.,
repeated use as a surgical scrub use where abrasion is followed by occlusion, characterizing the level of absorption,
the distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the ingredient, (2) a lifetime dermal carcinogenicity study (up
to 2 years) in mice, and (3) an appropriate human epidemiological study performed to determine the effects on health-care
professionals in countries, such as England, where the ingredient has been used extensively for a long period of time
are necessary. Further, in order to relate the data derived from the chronic animal study to humans, the lifetime dermal
carcinogenicity study should also include concomitant absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies.
A protocol for an 18-month dermal carcinogenicity study has been submitted to the agency (Ref. 48). The agency's detailed
comments and evaluation of the data and protocol are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 47).

Regarding the effectiveness of chloroxylenol, the agency stated the following in the previous tentative final monograph:
``Claims for broad spectrum activity have been made *&blank;*&blank;*; however, the Commissioner finds that inadequate
effectiveness data were submitted. Many studies were old and not performed with modern antiseptic testing procedures.
*&blank;*&blank;* effectiveness testing both in vitro and in vivo should be done in accordance with the Guidelines''
(43 FR 1238). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicable effectiveness data submitted by the comments were derived from in vivo and in vitro studies (Refs.
1 through 7 and 13 through 16), along with data subsequently submitted under the ``feedback'' procedures (Refs. 22
through 28 and 50). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data from in vivo glove juice studies (Refs. 1, 2, 19, and 50) demonstrated the antiseptic activity of chloroxylenol
in a range of 3 to 3.75 percent when formulated in an aqueous surfactant vehicle. Chloroxylenol formulations are substantive
in their activity, i.e., they do not produce an initial high reduction in the number of bacteria but after repeated
use (routine use), they reduce the baseline number of bacteria and suppress bacterial growth for 6 hours. In vivo data
for surgical hand scrub products containing chloroxylenol at concentrations lower than 3 percent are insufficient.
Aqueous solutions of chloroxylenol in a pine oil vehicle (1:40 dilution of Dettol

) from the hands of test subjects (Ref. 25). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In vivo cup scrubbing and other appropriate data (Refs. 22, 23, and 24) indicate that chloroxylenol, in 70 percent
alcohol, is fast acting as a patient preoperative skin preparation. However, alcohol itself meets the criteria for
a preoperative skin preparation and is a significant contributor for fast acting contaminant reduction. The data
are not sufficient to demonstrate that chloroxylenol in this formulation contributes to the total antimicrobial
effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In vitro study data (Refs. 1, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 16, and 26) show that chloroxylenol in various vehicles is effective against
gram-negative bacteria, i.e.,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This anti-gram-negative activity is formulation dependent. Tested aqueous solutions of pure chloroxylenol
with no other additives show that low concentrations (0.3 mg/mL) reduced 95 percent of some

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data regarding the antiseptic activity of chloroxylenol itself are not adequate. While the data are considered sufficient
to support in vitro effectiveness for the finished products, the available data are inadequate to show the contribution
of the chloroxylenol. Because these finished products contain several additional ingredients, e.g., surfactants,
isopropanol, pine oil, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which contributed substantial germicidal
activity, conclusions regarding chloroxylenol's active contribution to the product's efficacy cannot be supported.
The agency's detailed comments and evaluations of the submitted data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch
(Refs. 51 and 52). One manufacturer has responded to FDA's concern and provided additional data (Ref. 53). These data
are currently being reviewed by the agency and will be discussed in the final rule for these drug products. In summary,
the data are sufficient to support the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of the formulations tested. However, additional
data are needed to demonstrate that chloroxylenol contributes to the activity of these formulations. In addition,
data from glove juice studies indicate that the antimicrobial activity of chloroxylenol is substantive in nature
and does not produce an initial high reduction of bacteria, but that repeated use of the ingredient will produce a reduction
in bacteria as well as a suppression of the baseline number of bacteria of the normal skin flora for 6 hours. As discussed
in section I.N., comment 28, the agency is proposing that all antimicrobial products indicated for use as a surgical
scrub or health-care personnel handwash be able to demonstrate an immediate reduction in bacteria and is inviting
comment on the use of substantive antimicrobials in health-care antiseptic drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency, therefore, is proposing that chloroxylenol at the concentrations evaluated (0.24 percent to 3.75 percent)
be classified as Category I for safety and Category III for effectiveness for short-term use as a patient preoperative
skin preparation and in Category III for safety and effectiveness for long-term uses, i.e., antiseptic handwash
or health-care personnel handwash and surgical hand scrub. The existing data are not adequate to extrapolate and
assess the chronic toxicity of chloroxylenol for long-term use. Before chloroxylenol may be generally recognized
as effective, the agency recommends that appropriate in vitro and in vivo effectiveness data be submitted. The data
should include results obtained from both in vitro and in vivo tests as described in the testing procedures below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. One comment urged reconsideration of hexachlorophene as an OTC ``handwashing agent and antimicrobial skin cleanser
for use in the hospital, doctor's office, and by adult consumers.'' The comment stated that adequate data to support
Category I status were submitted in response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, but were only superficially
discussed by the agency in comment 61 of the tentative final monograph. (See the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1978, 43 FR 1210 at 1220.) The comment submitted additional data to support the safety of hexachlorophene,
including a retrospective study on 3 percent hexachlorophene in baby bathing (Ref. 1) and a study of hexachlorophene
blood levels in infants receiving routine antiseptic skin care (Ref. 2). The comment also included a comprehensive
review article on the safety and effectiveness of hexachlorophene (Ref. 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reevaluated the data discussed in comment 61 in the tentative final monograph (43 FR 1220) and evaluated
the new data, and has determined that the data do not warrant changing the classification of hexachlorophene as a prescription
drug. The infant data (Refs. 1 and 2) were discussed in detail in the tentative final monograph for OTC antimicrobial
diaper rash drug products (55 FR 25246 at 25261 to 25263). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summaries of handwash studies were also submitted, but no data were included. In one study, 3 percent hexachlorophene
was tested as a surgical scrub under exaggerated use conditions (Ref. 4). Subjects (number not specified) washed
their hands and forearms in 20 mL hexachlorophene for 10 minutes, 5 times daily, 6 days a week for a total of 58 days. No
signs of toxicity were reported. The blood levels of hexachlorophene reached a plateau 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 3 days at mean levels of 0.07 &mu;g/mL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that it would be necessary to test a very large group of subjects (the number of subjects required
to obtain a statistically significant result) with a variety of skin conditions to determine the true degree of absorption.
A similar study reviewed by the Panel (39 FR 33103 at 33118) reported blood levels of 0.5 &mu;g/mL or higher. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the other study, subjects washed their hands and face three times daily for 3 weeks with either 2 or 5 mL of 3 percent
hexachlorophene (Ref. 4). Blood concentrations reached a plateau within 7 days at mean levels of 0.21 &mu;g/mL for
the 2-mL group and 0.22 &mu;g/mL for the 5-mL group.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other additional data contained only a brief summary of the historical use of hexachlorophene and primarily cited
publications in the medical literature (Ref. 5). The references provided no new information. Consequently, the
agency has determined that hexachlorophene will continue on prescription status subject to the existing regulation
in 21 CFR 250.250. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for hexachlorophene to be switched to OTC status, the concerns expressed by the Antimicrobial I Panel that
hexachlorophene does not have an adequate margin of safety for OTC use (39 FR 33103 at 33117) should be addressed. After
reviewing the submitted data, the agency concludes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of this ingredient for OTC use on infants has not been demonstrated. For OTC status for use by adults, any further
submission of data should specifically address the safe OTC use of hexachlorophene in adults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the discussion above, the agency is proposing that hexachlorophene remain available by prescription
only, except when used as a preservative at concentrations of 0.1 percent or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's detailed comments and evaluation of the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 6).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. One comment pointed out that poloxamer-iodine complex appeared to be incorrectly included in the Category II
list under ``health-care personnel handwash'' (43 FR 1210 at 1227), while it is properly listed in Category III for
use as a ``health-care personnel handwash'' (43 FR 1210 at 1229). The comment stated that deletion from the Category
II list would correct the error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concurs with the comment that poloxamer-iodine complex for use as a health-care personnel handwash was
incorrectly listed as Category II (43 FR 1227) and that the listing as Category III (43 FR 1229) was correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. One comment submitted data on the safety and effectiveness of a ``mixed iodophor'' consisting of iodine complexed
by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Ref. 1). The comment stated that this information
had been previously submitted in May 1974, but that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient had not been mentioned in the Panel's report or in the agency's proposed monograph and requested that the
agency include it in the monograph. The comment pointed out that the iodophor, formulated as a liquid hand scrub, is
intended for use by surgeons, food handlers, and others for whom reduced bacterial skin flora is of public health significance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the comment's statement that the data were previously submitted, the agency has no record of any submission
of these data in 1974. Because this hand scrub was not previously reviewed or categorized as an OTC topical antimicrobial
drug product, the agency reviewed the product's marketing history and considers it appropriate to include this product
in the OTC drug review. The agency has evaluated the data submitted by the comment (Ref. 1) and determined that iodine
complexed by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate is safe for use as a surgical hand scrub
and health-care personnel handwash, but that there are insufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data available to determine its effectiveness for these uses. Therefore, the ingredient is being classified in Category
III.

The data included several studies on the absorption of the iodine complex, blood levels of iodine, and the systemic
toxicity of the iodine complex. Protein-bound iodine (PBI) and iodine blood levels in rabbits were determined following
two studies of acute dermal applications. In the first study, either 2 or 5 mL/kilogram (kg) of the test iodine complex
was applied to the shaved backs of rabbits in one experiment. The method of occlusion, if any, was not stated, but the
test material was washed off after 24 hours. In another experiment, 2 mL/kg of the test iodine complex was compared
with a povidone-iodine complex and both were applied as in the first experiment. PBI and total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iodine in blood were determined at 0, 24, and 48 hours in both experiments. In all treated animals, the level of PBI was
extremely high at certain times, primarily at 24 hours. Animals receiving the higher dose of iodine complex in the
first experiment seemed to return to normal sooner than those receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lower dose. All animals returned to normal by 14 days. For purposes of comparison, the second experiment showed
that serum total iodine increased from 1.4 to 30.7 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) in the test iodine complex group
compared to from 1.23 to 37.9 mg/dL in the povidone-iodine group in the 24 hours that the application remained on. In
the second study, 5 mL/kg of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test iodine complex was applied to the shaved backs of two groups of five rabbits each. In one group the shaved backs
were occluded for 24 hours and in the other group, the shaved backs were scrubbed for 10 minutes followed by rinsing
and occlusion. An additional group served as an untreated control group. Blood samples for iodine determinations
were taken at 0, 24, and 48 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours and at 14 days. All five animals in the group in which the iodine complex remained occluded on intact skin for 24
hours had markedly elevated levels of PBI and iodine at both 24 and 48 hours, but were only slightly above normal at 14
days. For the 10-minute scrub animals, the PBI levels were increased in two of five animals at 24 hours, slightly in
all five animals at 48 hours, and were normal at 14 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A study to determine the effect on blood PBI levels of a routine scrubbing procedure in which exposure to the iodine
complex exceeded normal use showed no alteration in PBI levels in four humans who scrubbed twice daily (each scrub
consisting of two 5 minute hand washes with 5 mL) for 26 consecutive days. Also, no irritation was observed. In a similar
study in which the subjects wore gloves for 2 hours after each scrub, PBI levels were not increased, but total iodine
was slightly increased. In two subjects, this increase was greater in the middle of the study, but the total iodine
blood levels were near normal by the end of the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A dermal absorption study in which the shaved backs of four monkeys were rubbed with 0.17 mL/kg of radioactive iodine
complex for 10 minutes, rinsed, wrapped for 2 hours, and the animals sacrificed after 24 hours, revealed that less
than 0.1 percent of the application was recovered in the thyroid, the target organ for iodine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 90-day sub-acute dermal toxicity study was conducted in three groups of monkeys divided into one control group and
two test groups. One test group was scrubbed once for 10 minutes daily with 0.17 mL/kg of the iodine surgical scrub detergent
product and the second group was scrubbed three times with 0.34 mL/kg (once for 10 minutes and twice for 3 minutes each
day). To simulate the wearing of surgical gloves, the treated area of each animal, which consisted of a shaved area
of the back equivalent to about 10 percent of the body area, was wrapped with a rubber dam for 30 to 90 minutes. The study
lasted 13 weeks during which the animals were monitored. Neither test group showed any effects of iodophor treatment
except elevated PBI levels in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high dose group, which peaked at one month. Also, there was no significant effect on the thyroid in the treated groups.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes this iodine complex is safe for humans based on the data from human, rabbit, and monkey studies.
Test data showed very little iodine absorption when the product was used as a scrub, negligible uptake (following
acute dermal application of radioactive iodine complex) by the thyroid in monkeys, and an unchanged thyroid weight
in test groups of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monkeys following 90 days of sub-acute applications of the iodine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment submitted data from one clinical study for evaluating effectiveness as a surgical hand scrub but did not
provide the testing protocol used. Five subjects scrubbed three times daily for 5 days with the iodophor formulation
(containing 1.1 percent iodine). Four subjects completed the study. Surgical gloves were worn for 2 hours after the
first wash of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day. Subjects' hands were sampled once each day at the end of the 2-hour gloved period using a single-basin Cade method.
The initial sampling was used to establish a baseline microbial count for each subject. Study results were reported
as the number of organisms per mL of basin water and the percent reduction in the number of organisms recovered. The
reduction in the bacterial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population ranged from 89 to 98 percent on the first day. By the fifth day, the reduction ranged from 99 to 100 percent.
Similar results were obtained in a comparative study on six subjects using povidone-iodine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although it is clear that the test used was not the glove juice test which is described in the antimicrobial tentative
final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1242), alternative methods may be acceptable. However, because of the small number
of subjects included in the study, the data are not sufficient to support the Category I classification of this ingredient
for use as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgical hand scrub. Additional studies, of the type described in &sect;333.470(b)(1) of this amended tentative
final monograph, are necessary to support the effectiveness of this surfactant iodine complex for this use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1235), the agency recognized that elemental iodine complexed with
a surfactant type ``carrier'' molecule reduces the amount of immediate ``free'' iodine, because most of the formulated
iodine is bound in the complex. Effectiveness of all iodophors is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent on the release of free iodine as the active agent from the complexing molecule which acts only as a carrier.
The agency acknowledges that iodine complexed with a surfactant is an acceptable way of presenting iodine as an antimicrobial
agent to the skin. However, because most of the formulated iodine may be tied up in the complex and because the information
submitted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the comment to support in vitro efficacy (Ref. 2) dealt only with aqueous and/or tincture solutions of free iodine,
testing of the complete formulation is necessary to judge the importance of formulation on the release of the active
ingredient and, thus, its influence on aspects of effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the data submitted, the agency concludes that iodine complexed by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene
sorbitan monolaurate is safe but additional data from appropriate studies are needed to establish general recognition
of effectiveness for use as a surgical hand scrub and health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel handwash. The data should include results obtained from both in vitro and in vivo testing procedures. (See
section I.N., comment 28.)

16. Several comments objected to the warning proposed for the professional labeling for povidone-iodine and iodophor-surfactant
products: ``Caution: Do not use this product in the presence of starch-containing products. Starch can adsorb iodophors
and the resulting complex can cause serosal adhesions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(abnormal union of the serous membranes) and other undesirable effects in the body'' (43 FR 1210 at 1221). The comments
pointed out that the study by Goodrich, Prine, and Wilson (Ref. 1) on which the warning is based is not well controlled,
is rudimentary, and lacks rigorous testing that produces evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which can be statistically analyzed. The comments contended that this article is not sufficient basis for the warning.
The comments requested that the impact of the article by Goodrich, Prine, and Wilson on the labeling of nonsurfactant
iodophors be reevaluated and that povidone-iodine be exempt from the required warning relating to contact of starch
and iodophors. One comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that there are numerous papers in the literature describing the antiadhesive effect of povidone and povidone-iodine
and submitted nine references dealing with humans and animals that support an antiadhesive effect when povidone
or povidone-iodine is used in intraperitoneal surgery (Ref. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment explained that starch is well known for producing granuloma and that every package of surgeons' gloves
carries a warning statement to the effect that the outside of the gloves must be cleansed of starch powder prior to use.
The comment concluded that FDA should require a warning label on the gloves, but not on products containing the drug.

FDA has reevaluated the article by Goodrich et al. (Ref. 1), considered the additional cited references (Ref. 2),
and examined current policy on the labeling of United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.) Absorbable Dusting Powder (cornstarch).
Goodrich, Prine, and Wilson (Ref. 1) provide data from observations and arbitrary scoring of adhesions after intraperitoneal
injection into 4 groups of 13 adult female mice with: (1) Powdered starch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspended in 1.5 mL of normal saline, (2) powdered starch treated with 5 mL of an iodophor and washed three times in saline
before resuspension in 1.5 mL normal saline, (3) powdered starch treated with 5 mL of a 10-percent solution of surfactant
washed three times in saline and resuspended in 1.5 mL of normal saline and (4) normal saline (control animals). The
data do not indicate any significant difference between suspensions of the surfactant mixed with starch and the surfactant-iodophor
mixed with starch. The agency's policy on the labeling of surgical gloves treated with Absorbable Dusting Powder
U.S.P., determined upon evidence presented during the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation, was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 25, 1971 (36 FR 9475). The agency requires the following statement on surgical gloves treated with Absorbable
Dusting Powder U.S.P.: ``Caution: after donning, remove powder by wiping gloves thoroughly with a sterile wet sponge,
sterile wet towel, or other effective method.'' Products containing Absorbable Dusting Powder U.S.P. for lubricating
surgical gloves were formerly classified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as new drugs, but are now regarded as transitional devices, for which premarket approval is required under the Medical
Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (42 FR 63472 at 63474). FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological
Health is establishing categories for all surgical devices, including surgical gloves lubricated with powdered
starch. Any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in the labeling for this class of products will be dealt with in a separate rulemaking procedure and separate

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that the user's removal of dusting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
powder from surgical medical devices (rubber goods) treated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Absorbable Dusting Powder U.S.P. decreases the incidence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adhesions and is not persuaded that the data in the article by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Goodrich, Prine, and Wilson provide a sufficient scientific basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a warning label. Therefore, the warning about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interaction of iodophors and starch-containing products proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in comment 66 of the previous tentative final monograph is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in this amended tentative final monograph.

17. A number of comments submitted new data (Ref. 1) to establish that povidone-iodine is safe and effective as a topical
antimicrobial drug. The comments requested that povidone-iodine be reclassified from Category III to Category
I as a topical antimicrobial ingredient for use as an antimicrobial soap, health-care personnel handwash, surgical
hand scrub, patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparation, skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed earlier in this document, this amended tentative final monograph addresses only topical antiseptics
for health-care antiseptic uses as a surgical hand scrub, antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash,
and patient preoperative skin preparation. As discussed in section I.B., comment 5, antimicrobial soaps are no longer
included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking. The agency addressed the other use categories mentioned in the comment in a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644). As discussed in comment 38 of that document (56 FR 33660),
FDA has tentatively concluded that povidone-iodine should be classified in Category I for use as a first aid antiseptic
(formerly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has considered the new data submitted and other information in support of the request to reclassify povidone-iodine
from Category III to Category I. On the basis of these data and information, the agency tentatively concludes that
povidone-iodine should be reclassified from Category III to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category I as a topical antiseptic ingredient for use in surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin preparation,
and health-care personnel or antiseptic handwash drug products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The general safety aspects of povidone-iodine that concerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 1234 to 1236) are addressed elsewhere as follows: (1) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of povidone-iodine on wound healing. Based upon submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data, the agency concluded in the first aid antiseptic segment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rulemaking that non-surfactant iodophor products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(povidone-iodine) do not delay wound healing. See comment 42 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that document (56 FR 33644 at 33662). Also, the Advisory Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panel on OTC Antimicrobial II Drug Products reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine's effect on wound healing in its report on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical antifungal drug products and concluded that the drug did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not affect wound healing (47 FR 12480 at 12545). (2) The effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of povidone-iodine on thyroid function. In comment 41 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products (56 FR 33644 at 33661), the agency discusses studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that indicate that topically applied povidone-iodine does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause thyroid dysfunction. (3) The proposed warning about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interaction of starch-containing products with iodophors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting in serosal adhesions and other undesirable effects, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i.e., ``Caution: Do not use this product in the presence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
starch-containing products. Starch can adsorb iodophors and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting complex can cause serosal adhesions (abnormal union of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the serous membranes) and other undesirable effects in the body'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(43 FR 1210 at 1221). The agency has reevaluated the proposal and decided that the warning is not supported by the data.
(See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section I.I., comment 16.) (4) The agency's concern regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molecular weights of povidone-iodine greater than 35,000 daltons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not being excreted by the kidney and causing lymph node changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In section I.I., comment 18, the agency discusses a previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed warning regarding this subject and determines, based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more recent data, that larger povidone-iodine molecules are not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk when the product is limited to the topical uses included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's concern about the need for expiration dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(not to exceed 2 years after manufacture) because of the lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stability data for several iodophor preparations, which relates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the effectiveness of the product, can be satisfied by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the current good manufacturing practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations (21 CFR parts 210 and 211). These regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include, among other things, requirements regarding stability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing and expiration dating (see &sect;&sect;211.137 and 211.166). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as discussed in comment 40 of the tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 33661), data on the stability of povidone-iodine and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed 2-year expiration date are no longer considered needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this rulemaking proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second agency concern relating to effectiveness was the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate of release of ``free'' iodine from the complex and whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there was evidence of germicidal activity over a period of time in clinical application (43 FR 1210 at 1235). As discussed
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tentative final monograph for OTC topical acne drug products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(comment 5, 50 FR 2172 at 2173), iodine is released from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine complex within milliseconds, thus resolving this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the effectiveness of health-care antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses subject to this rulemaking, the agency has reviewed the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and information on povidone-iodine's germicidal in vitro and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic in vivo effectiveness (Refs. 1 through 19) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concludes that the data are sufficient to reclassify this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient from Category III to Category I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A series of in vitro controlled studies (Ref. 1&hyph;C133, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volume 1) included a broad spectrum of test micro-organisms which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were associated with between 40 to 60 percent of the nosocomial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infections in the urinary tract, surgical wounds, pneumonia, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bloodstream, reported by the National Nosocomial Infections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surveillance System (NNIS) for the period from January 1985 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 1988 (Ref. 2). In most instances, these test micro-organisms, as proposed in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii) (see
section I.C., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment 6), were killed after 0.5 to 5 minutes exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine. A minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 1&hyph;C133) using 30 cultures, both American Type Culture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Collection (ATCC) and recent skin isolates, was also included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this series of in vitro studies. The results indicated a range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for MIC from 87 parts per million (ppm) to 492 ppm for dilutions of povidone-iodine solution and 83 ppm to 476 ppm for
dilutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of povidone-iodine surgical scrub depending on the test micro-organism. Tests with controls, neutralizer, and
organic load 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using a serial dilution method were included in the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gocke, Ponticas, and Pollack (Ref. 3) evaluated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
susceptibility of 230 clinical isolates from blood, urine, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sputum, and wound cultures to the bacteriocidal activity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine. These clinical isolates contained over half the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organisms included in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii). Results indicated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that 106 of the 230 organisms tested (46 percent) were killed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when 1 mL of a standardized suspension containing 108 organisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was exposed to a 10 percent povidone-iodine solution for 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seconds. Povidone-iodine showed its highest activity against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gram-negative isolates, with 72 of the 94 isolates (75 percent)

being killed after a 15-second exposure. Only 34 of the 134 (25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent) gram-positive isolates were killed under the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. However, further testing of organisms not killed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after a 15-second exposure indicated that increases in exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time to 120 seconds killed all of the previously ``resistant''

isolates. The study design incorporated the use of a neutralizer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and controls.

The effectiveness of a povidone-iodine formulation on micro-organisms in a clinical setting was demonstrated by
Michael (Ref. 4). The study included 100 subjects with decubitus ulcers following a spinal cord injury. Cultures
of the wounds were taken prior to, during, and upon completion of a once-a-day povidone-iodine treatment. Prior to
treatment, subjects had positive cultures for the following organisms: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(60 subjects),

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Klebsiella/Enterobacter

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (15 subjects), and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
species (15 species). Following an 8-to-10 week period of treatment with povidone-iodine, cultures revealed that
90 of the 110 subjects no longer had positive cultures for these organisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pereira, Lee, and Wade (Ref. 5) conducted an in vivo gloved hand test that is supportive of the effectiveness of povidone-iodine
as a surgical hand scrub. They examined the effects of surgical scrub duration and type of antiseptic on the reduction
of resident microbial flora. Thirty-four subjects scrubbed with a 7.5 percent povidone-iodine formulation or another
antiseptic formulation using either a 5 minute initial/3 minute consecutive scrub procedure or a 3 minute initial/30
second scrub procedure. Subjects were assigned to one of four groups, and each group was assigned to one of the four
treatments. Sampling was done by the glove juice method using a sampling solution containing a neutralizer. Glove
juice samples were taken from both hands immediately before scrubbing (baseline), from the nondominant hand immediately
after the initial scrub, 2 hours after the initial surgical scrub but before the consecutive scrub (dominant hand),
and 2 hours after one consecutive surgical scrub (dominant hand). No significant difference was found between the
two durations of scrubbing with povidone-iodine. Povidone-iodine produced an immediate 1.2 log

either the 5 or 3 minute scrub. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aly and Maibach (Ref. 6) evaluated the characteristics of two antimicrobial impregnated surgical hand scrub sponge/brush
drug products. The study, which included a widely used povidone-iodine impregnated surgical hand scrub sponge/brush,
evaluated both the immediate and persistent effect on the resident bacterial flora of the hands plus the effect of
blood on the persistent antimicrobial activity of the surgical hand scrub drug products. In the first phase of the
study, 13 subjects with left and right hand baseline counts of >10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 organisms were randomly assigned to perform a total of 11 scrubs with the povidone-iodine impregnated sponge/brush.
Glove juice samples were taken from the right hand of each subject immediately following the first scrub of the day
and from the left hand at either 3 or 6 hours. The entire procedure was repeated on test days 2 and 5. A similar procedure
was used in phase two of the study, except that 2 mL of bacteriologically sterile blood was spread over the hands of 6
subjects following the initial scrub, and sampling occurred only at 3 and 6 hours. Neutralizers were incorporated
into the stripping solution, diluent, and culture media. On day 1, povidone-iodine produced an immediate mean log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of 1.2, and baseline was not exceeded at 3 hours. On days 2 and 5, povidone-iodine produced immediate mean
log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively, and bacterial counts did not exceed baseline at 6 hours. While counts for
povidone-iodine approached baseline in the presence of blood, counts did not exceed baseline at 6 hours on any day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another study (Ref. 1&hyph;C104), employing a method similar to the effectiveness testing procedures described
in proposed &sect;333.470(b)(2) of this amended tentative final monograph, demonstrated the effectiveness of
povidone-iodine 5 percent as a health-care personnel handwash. Twenty-five consecutive handwashings were done
in 10 human subjects with a 5 minute rest between washings. Before each washing the hands were dipped in broth culture
containing 2.0 x 10

of every fifth washing by the glove juice sampling method. Both the dilution fluid and growth media incorporated a
neutralizer. The transient microbial flora of the hands was reduced by an average of 5.8 logs from baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dineen (Ref. 7) used a 7.5 percent povidone-iodine formulation as a reference antiseptic in an open crossover evaluation
of a health-care personnel handwash drug product. Participation in the study followed a 1-week prewash period in
which study subjects used only a bland nonantiseptic soap. On day 1 of the study, samples were taken prior to contamination
and again after a second contamination followed by a 15-second wash with a bland nonantiseptic soap, using the glove
juice sampling method. Following the post-wash sampling, subjects washed for 5 minutes with povidone-iodine to
remove any remaining inoculum. The hands of the first three subjects were contaminated with a 1 mL inoculum containing

. Inocula concentrations were determined each test day in a parallel experiment. On days 3 or 4 and 5, the procedure
was repeated except that subjects were randomly assigned to wash with either (1) the reference antiseptic or the test
preparation or (2) were crossed over to the preparation not used the previous day. In the interim between test days,
subjects followed the wash and sampling procedure using only the nonantiseptic soap. The number of organisms included
in the 1 mL inoculum was taken as the baseline, and all reductions were calculated on this basis. Neutralizers were
incorporated in both the diluent and the culture medium. When corrected for the average log reduction produced by
the nonantiseptic soap (4-log

Studies conducted by Ulrich (Ref. 8) and Newsom and Matthews 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 9) are supportive of the effectiveness of povidone-iodine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this indication. Ulrich (Ref. 8) conducted a study using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine 7.5 percent in 25 subjects. Both hands of each

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed to air dry for 60 seconds. This artificial hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination was followed by a 15-second wash with 5 mL of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine preparation, and this same procedure was repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until 25 contaminations/washes had been performed. Glove fluid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples were taken after every fifth contamination/wash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dilutions of the glove fluid were made in a sterile diluent that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included a neutralizer. A neutralizer was also incorporated into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the culture medium. Based on the average of both hands, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine preparation produced a 4.9 and a 5.2 log 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction of the transient micro-organisms from baseline by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5th and 10th wash, respectively. By the end of the 25th wash the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine preparation demonstrated a 5.5 log

from the baseline bacterial count. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newsom and Matthews (Ref. 9) studied test solutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing 5 or 10 percent povidone-iodine on hands artificially

contaminated with an overnight culture of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The numbers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of micro-organisms were measured before and immediately after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand disinfection with the test solution in 15 subjects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sampling of the hands was accomplished by kneading the fingertips 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a ``recovery'' broth that included a neutralizer. A mean 4.4 log reduction from baseline was reported for the bacterial
counts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken immediately after the antiseptic wash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ayliffe, Babb, and Quoraishi (Ref. 10) evaluated the effect

30-second wash with 5 mL of a detergent or alcoholic antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, a 30-second wash with an unmedicated soap, or no wash

at all. Bacterial sampling was accomplished by rubbing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fingers and thumbs on glass beads immersed in 100 mL of nutrient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broth containing neutralizers. All treatments were tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against each organism. Results were reported as the log of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a second set of experiments (Ref. 10), the same authors assessed the effectiveness of three antiseptic formulations,
including povidone-iodine, and an unmedicated soap in the removal of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus, S. saprophyticus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from contaminated fingertips. Under conditions similar to those in the previous study, povidone-iodine demonstrated
a 3-log reduction in the baseline number of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which was significantly superior to the log reduction demonstrated by the unmedicated soap. Povidone-iodine produced
an average 2.1 log reduction in the number of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. saprophyticus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and a 2.8 reduction in the number of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, neither of these reductions was significantly different from the reductions produced by the unmedicated
soap. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rotter (Ref. 11) evaluated the influence of differences in two testing methodologies on the demonstration of the
effectiveness of povidone-iodine. One test method used is the standard test method (Vienna) for the evaluation of
drug products for hygienic disinfection adopted by the Austrian and German Societies for Hygiene and Microbiology.
In this test model, the release of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from the finger tips of artificially contaminated hands was determined before and after a 1-minute wash with povidone-iodine.
The second model, based on agency recommendations for the testing of health-care personnel handwashes, evaluated
the release of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from all surfaces of artificially contaminated hands by the glove juice sampling method before and after a 1 minute
wash with the ingredient. These comparisons showed no significant difference in the reduction factor produced by
povidone-iodine when tested with the two methods. Povidone-iodine when tested by the Vienna test method produced
a 3.3 log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction from the baseline count. When tested by the second method, the ingredient produced a 3.2 log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rotter (Ref. 11) also used the Vienna test method to assess the effectiveness of rubbing antiseptics onto the hands
versus washing with an antiseptic. Two povidone-iodine containing formulations were included in the assessment.
A watery solution of povidone-iodine with 1 percent available free iodine rubbed onto the skin produced a 4 log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction. Washing with a detergent formulation of the ingredient produced a 3.2 log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction. However, this reduction was not statistically different from the reduction produced by washing with
a nonantiseptic soap. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rotter, Koller, and Wewalka (Ref. 12) used the Vienna test model to assess the effectiveness of a povidone-iodine
liquid soap preparation (containing 0.75 percent available free iodine) for hygienic hand disinfection. The subjects'
hands were contaminated by immersing them up to the mid-metacarpals in a broth culture of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. coli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The hands were allowed to air dry for 3 minutes prior to a pretreatment sampling. Sampling was accomplished by rubbing
the finger tips of each hand for 1 minute on the bottom of a Petri dish containing a phosphate buffer sampling solution
with neutralizers. After a 2-minute wash with the povidone-iodine or liquid soap followed by a 20-second rinse, the
hands were again sampled. Average log values of the counts from the right and left hands of each subject were calculated,
and the difference (log reduction factor) was determined. The povidone-iodine liquid soap formulation produced
a 3.2 log

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction in the transient organisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wade and Casewell (Ref. 13) evaluated the residual effectiveness of povidone-iodine against two clinical isolates
associated with hospital outbreaks of infection. An initial determination of the survival of the test organisms
on untreated hands of three subjects was made by contaminating the subjects' finger tips with either of the test organisms
and sampling the individual fingers immediately after contamination and at 1, 3, 10, and 30 minutes. The subjects'
hands were then pretreated by performing three 30-second washes at 5 minute intervals with various alcoholic and
aqueous antiseptic test formulations, including a 7.5 percent povidone-iodine formulation and an unmedicated
bar soap. The contamination and sampling procedure was repeated as before. All formulations were tested against
both organisms. The median value of the log counts for the three subjects as each sampling was plotted against time.
The survival curves for both organisms on hands pretreated by washing with an unmedicated soap and on hands with no
pretreatment were similar. Pretreatment with povidone-iodine resulted in counts that were consistently less than
for the untreated hands and for the hands pretreated by washing with an unmedicated soap and water for both organisms.
After 30 minutes, hands pretreated with the povidone-iodine formulation demonstrated a 2.5 log

. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concludes that these data demonstrate the effectiveness of povidone-iodine 5 to 10 percent for use as a
health-care personnel handwash.

followed are different from those in the previous FDA testing procedures (43 FR 1210 at 1244) and from those proposed
in &sect;333.470 of this amended tentative final monograph, the essential criteria have been met.

Georgiade et al. (Ref. 15) evaluated the effectiveness of two povidone-iodine formulations for use in the preoperative
skin preparation of 150 subjects scheduled for elective surgical procedures. An initial sample for culture was taken
from the unbroken skin of the operation site prior to the use of the formulations, and a baseline bacterial count was
determined. Sampling was by a cup scrubbing method, using a sterile wash solution that incorporated a neutralizer.
The operative site was then gently treated for 5 minutes with a povidone-iodine surgical scrub formulation and allowed
to dry. Following the initial disinfection, a povidone-iodine antiseptic solution was evenly applied to the site
and allowed to dry. The sample site was rinsed with sterile water and a second sample for culture was done. Upon completion
of surgical procedures lasting from 30 to 180 minutes, the sample site was again cultured and sterile dressings were
applied. The reported mean post-scrub reduction in the baseline number of bacteria of the sample site was 30,599 (4.5

 reduction). This reduction was maintained through the surgery as evidenced by the reported post-operative mean
reduction of 30,613 organisms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vorherr, Vorherr, and Moss (Ref. 16) compared three antiseptic preparations (including 10 percent povidone-iodine),
in 150 female subjects (50 to each preparation) for effectiveness in reducing the numbers of bacteria in the perineum
and groin. The mean log reductions in bacteria after skin preparation with povidone-iodine at 10 minutes and 3 hours,
respectively, were reported as 3.65/3.09 for the perineum and 3.42/2.85 for the groin. Another study by Dzubow et
al. (Ref. 17) evaluated three antiseptic skin preparations frequently used for dermatologic surgical procedures.
A 60-second wipe with 1-percent povidone- iodine was performed in 14 subjects after which aerobic and anaerobic cultures
were taken at 5 and 60 minutes. The aerobic flora were reduced by 2.8 and 2.5 log at 5 and 60 minutes, respectively. The
reduction in anaerobic flora was reported to be 1.7 log at 5 minutes and 1.2 log at 60 minutes.

Leaper, Lewis, and Speller (Ref. 18) compared the effectiveness of povidone-iodine impregnated drapes, povidone-
iodine with a sterile drape, and conventional preoperative skin preparation with povidone-iodine for the reduction
of skin bacteria. Forty-five subjects scheduled to undergo elective groin surgery were randomized to one of the three
treatments. Impression plates and skin swabs were taken immediately before and after surgery, and swabs were taken
before and after skin incision and closure. Conventional preoperative skin prepping with povidone-iodine produced
the greatest reduction of the bacterial flora (240 colony counts to 34 colony counts, 2.3 log

Duignan and Lowe (Ref. 19) studied the effectiveness of povidone-iodine for reducing pathogenic bacteria in the
vagina. A 1:10 solution of a povidone-iodine formulation containing 0.75 percent available free iodine was instilled
into the vagina of 35 subjects and left in situ for 1 to 3 minutes. Aspirate cultures were taken from the vagina before
and after preoperative disinfection and subcultured into thioglycollate broth containing neutralizers. Povidone-iodine
removed 92 percent of the bacteroides species, anaerobic streptococci, gram negative bacilli, and

A surveillance report (Ref. 1&hyph;C132) of hospital infections showed that the use of povidone-iodine in preparing
patients for catheterization significantly reduced the rate of urinary tract infections. A 5-year study showed
that the rate of urinary tract infections before October 1977 ranged from 5.2 percent to 11.5 percent (mean 7.8 percent),
but beginning in October 1977 when povidone-iodine was the antiseptic solution in use, the rate ranged from 1.0 percent
to 4.0 percent (mean 2.4 percent). At the 95 percent confidence level this is statistically significant. No method
data accompanied the report except that the urethral meatus was cleansed with cotton dipped in the antiseptic solution
before catheterization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that these studies and other published and publicly available medical and scientific data demonstrate
that povidone-iodine is effective for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation. Although all of the trials
were not done the same way, and thus they are not strictly comparable, the weight of the evidence shows that povidone-iodine
is effective both as a preoperative skin preparation and surgical hand scrub, reducing the normal microbial flora
by more than 90 percent and not showing any significant qualitative selection among the normal species found on the
skin. In conclusion, povidone-iodine was effective against a wide spectrum of pathogenic and normal skin micro-organisms
and maintained some suppressive effect on skin counts after the initial use. In addition to the data reviewed supporting
the safety and effectiveness of povidone-iodine for these professional uses, the agency classified povidone-iodine
5 to 10 percent as Category I as a first aid antiseptic in the tentative final monograph published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644). Accordingly, the agency is reclassifying povidone-iodine 5 to 10 percent from Category
III to Category I for use as a topical antiseptic ingredient for use in surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin
preparation, and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash drug products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
18. Several comments objected to the agency's proposal that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the professional labeling of povidone-iodine products containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molecules greater than 35,000 daltons should include warnings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against parenteral use and against exposure of open surgical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wounds or deep wounds to the product. (See comment 71, 43 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1210 at 1221.) Some of the comments contended that the Panel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended such warnings because it felt there was widespread 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misuse (unapproved use) of povidone-iodine solution by surgeons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bathing the peritoneal cavity with povidone-iodine during major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgery and then cleansing the area by rinsing. Another comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that because health-care personnel handwashes or surgical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand scrubs require a surfactant, such products so formulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would never be considered for peritoneal lavage by surgeons. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment argued that labeling to warn against parenteral use is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly beyond the scope of the OTC drug review and FDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory authority. Another comment stated that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary to establish an arbitrary molecular weight limit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine because no parenteral use of povidone-iodine is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted in any of the approved labeling in the new drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for those products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that povidone-iodine is generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized as safe and effective for use in open wounds and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning against such use would be contrary to clinical experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this drug. In support of this position, the comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted a controlled study in which the surgical incisions of one group were irrigated before closure with 10 percent

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine solution, and the surgical incisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control group were irrigated before closure with saline solution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 1). The comment stated that the results of this study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showed a significant decrease in infections when povidone-iodine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was used, and there were no allergic, adverse, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deleterious effects following this use of povidone-iodine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the Commissioner's recommendation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research data (43 FR 1210 at 1235), one comment submitted an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive review of the extent of scavenging of residual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine molecules by the reticuloendothelial system and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible lymph node involvement following use in the abdominal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cavity or in large wounds (Ref. 2). The comment stated that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on these data, povidone-iodine with medium molecular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weights should not be limited to use on intact skin, nor should a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning be required. Another comment stated that the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molecular weight of povidone in the povidone-iodine that has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used exclusively in topical antimicrobial products for almost a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarter of a century is 37,900 daltons, and it presents no risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any of the topical antimicrobial uses covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Panel recognized a relationship between molecular size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and nodular lymphatic changes accompanying exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine, but made no decision on limiting the molecular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size causing such pathology. (See 39 FR 33103 at 33130.) In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous tentative final monograph, FDA evaluated data provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a comment (Ref. 3) that contended there should be restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the use of povidone-iodine according to molecular size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Published research cited in that comment indicated that povidone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molecules larger than 40,000 daltons cannot be excreted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kidneys, can cause nodules to appear in the lymphatic system, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may induce cosmetic deformities in the area of healing skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wounds. Based on expert opinion and the data provided in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment (Ref. 3), the agency proposed that a molecular weight of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35,000 daltons be established as the safe upper limit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine products used parenterally. This calculation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed that a povidone-iodine molecule with this molecular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight would be too large to pass through the kidney. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment 71, 43 FR 1210 at 1221.) FDA also noted its awareness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the inappropriate use of povidone-iodine products in open wounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in the abdominal cavity during surgery. (See 43 FR 1235.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To promote proper use of povidone-iodine products, FDA proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to recognize two categories of such products. Products with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine molecular weights less than 35,000 daltons would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be permitted for general use. Appropriate labeling would place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each product in its proper category of use. The professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling of povidone-iodine products containing molecules greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 35,000 daltons would also include warnings against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parenteral use of, and exposure of open surgical wounds or deep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wounds to, the product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this current tentative final monograph, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that the professional uses of povidone-iodine that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed as safe and effective are limited to a patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparation, health-care personnel handwash, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and surgical hand scrub. Further examination of the reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited in the previous tentative final monograph (Ref. 3) reveals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the reported adverse effects were due to intravenous or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parenteral use of povidone. Based on the more recent data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, the agency now believes that neither medium nor larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molecular weight povidone-iodine molecules present risks when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to the topical uses included in this tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph. Larger molecules of povidone-iodine would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absorbed if the drug is used for these professional uses in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the monograph. Thus, there is no need for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional labeling to limit the molecular weight of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine products or to require special warnings related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the molecular weight of povidone-iodine. Accordingly, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling is not being included in this tentative final monograph.

19. Several comments contended that there are numerous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional uses for povidone-iodine, particularly uses that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve medical devices, that were not discussed by the Panel or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the agency in the tentative final monograph. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional uses include catheter care, ostomy hygiene, patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin scrubbing prior to preoperative prepping, surgical site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleansing after stitching, mouth and throat swabbing, treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the skin before covering a fracture with a cast, antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of various scalp problems, and intravenous site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation. One comment added that a pharmacist or other health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional may recommend the use of povidone-iodine as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
douche, perianal wash, or whirlpool concentrate. The comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested that special labeling be added to the monograph to cover all of these uses, but did not submit data regarding
these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment also provided professional labeling for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine used for urinary or intravenous catheter care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. The suggested labeling included the following terms: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``antiseptic,'' ``germicide,'' ``microbicidal,'' and ``for hospital and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional use.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several of the professional uses mentioned by the comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not covered by this rulemaking, but they will be addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under other OTC drug rulemakings. For example, the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine for mouth and throat swabbing is included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC oral health care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug products, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 25, 1982 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(47 FR 22760). The use of povidone-iodine for the treatment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scalp problems is addressed in the final rule for OTC dandruff, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis drug products, published in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 4, 1991 (56 FR 63554). The use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of povidone-iodine as a douche is addressed in the advance notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of proposed rulemaking for OTC vaginal drug products, published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 13, 1983 (48 FR 46694). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Advisory Review Panel on OTC Hemorrhoidal Drug Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the inclusion of antiseptics in OTC anorectal drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products ``is useful in concept,'' but ``that proof of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant clinical benefit of claimed antiseptic ingredients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be demonstrated in clinical trials'' (45 FR 35576 at 35659). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That Panel believed that, because of the large numbers of micro-organisms present in feces, there is little likelihood
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective antisepsis could be obtained in the anorectal area with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptics any more than with soap and water. Because no data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were submitted on povidone-iodine as a perianal wash, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did not address this ingredient in the discussion of antiseptics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the tentative final monograph for OTC anorectal drug products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the agency evaluated the Panel's conclusions. Similarly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ingredient was not included in the final rule for OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anorectal drug products, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 3, 1990 (55 FR 31766). Parties interested in this use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
povidone-iodine can submit data and information as part of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citizen petition to amend the final rule for OTC anorectal drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. (See 21 CFR 10.30.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several of the uses suggested by the comments are related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the general category of patient preoperative skin preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that was discussed by the Panel. (See the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 13, 1974, 39 FR 33103 and 33114.) One example is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use ``patient skin scrubbing prior to preoperative prepping.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency believes that this use can more simply be described by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication ``for preparation of the skin prior to surgery,'' which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is being proposed in &sect;333.460(b)(1)(i) of this tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph. Other uses are catheter care, ostomy hygiene, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intravenous site preparation. Some uses mentioned by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments involve postoperative situations (surgical site cleansing after stitching) or do not even involve a surgical

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure (treatment of skin prior to covering a fracture with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cast or use as a whirlpool concentrate). The agency believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that instead of trying to identify in the product's labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every possible situation where use of the product would reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the risk of skin infection, this use of the product can best be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described by the general indication ``Helps to reduce bacteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that potentially can cause skin infection,'' which is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in &sect;333.460(b)(1)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has considered the term ``for hospital and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional use only'' suggested by one comment and finds it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable for professional labeling. (See section I.D., comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8.) Likewise, the agency has no objection to terms such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``germicide,'' ``germicidal,'' and ``microbicidal'' being used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional labeling because health professionals understand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaning of these terms. However, the agency does not believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a need to include in the monograph every one of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms that might be used in the professional labeling of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. These terms will be evaluated by the agency on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product-by-product basis, under the provision of section 502 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the act (21 U.S.C. 352) relating to labeling that is false or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misleading.

20. One comment requested that benzalkonium chloride be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed in Category I as a skin antiseptic, a patient preoperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin preparation, and a skin wound protectant, in addition to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present Category I classification as a skin wound cleanser. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support of its request, the comment cited several surgery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
textbooks and other references that recommend use of benzalkonium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloride at concentrations ranging from 1:750 to 1:5,000 as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparation, surgical scrub, skin antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for venipuncture, and in urinary tract procedures, especially in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catheterized patients (Ref. 1). The comment also submitted two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies on a product containing benzalkonium chloride at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of 1:1,000: (1) An in vitro study to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this product formulation acts as a physical chemical barrier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against contamination by micro-organisms, and (2) a study on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
induced wounds on the arms of 10 healthy subjects to present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence that this product is nonirritating and neither delays 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
healing nor favors the growth of micro-organisms (Ref. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency determined in the tentative final monograph for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTC first aid antiseptic drug products that the safe and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective concentration range for using benzalkonium chloride as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a first aid antiseptic has been established as 0.1 percent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.13 percent. (See 56 FR 33644 and 33663.) Data submitted to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Antimicrobial I Panel and by the comment were sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish safety for products intended for short-term use, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a first aid antiseptic drug product. The data submitted also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support safety for use as a patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, based on the short-term use of the drug for this purpose. However, the data reviewed by the Panel and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplemented by the comments to establish the efficacy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzalkonium chloride for use as a topical antiseptic ingredient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in patient preoperative skin preparations are not sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Antimicrobial I Panel placed this ingredient in Category III 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this use. (See 39 FR 33103 and 33115.) The agency finds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the surgery textbooks and other references cited by the comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 1) do not contain sufficient information about quantitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and qualitative changes in the microbial flora of the treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin areas. Before benzalkonium chloride may be generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarded as effective for use as a patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, additional in vitro and in vivo effectiveness data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are needed. The data should include results obtained from both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in vitro and in vivo testing procedures as described for patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparation drug products. (See section I.N., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment 28.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, benzalkonium chloride remains classified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category III as a topical antiseptic ingredient for use as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient preoperative skin preparation.

21. Two comments objected to the proposed warning statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;333.92(c)(6) for concentrated products containing quaternary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ammonium compounds, which states, ``Dilute with distilled water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before use because acidic or hard water may render the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inactive.'' One comment contended that this proposed warning is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prejudicial to the quaternary ammonium products that can act in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acidic or hard water and noted that the existence of quaternary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ammonium compounds that can act as antimicrobials in acidic or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hard water was recognized in the tentative final monograph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(43 FR 1210 at 1219). The comment recommended that the labeling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of products containing quaternary ammonium compounds include a statement, based on appropriate laboratory tests,
about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability of the product to perform in acidic solutions and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of water hardness (described as parts per million (ppm) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calcium carbonate) in which the product will continue to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other comment stated that several concentrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g., 50 percent benzalkonium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloride, U.S.P.) registered with the Environmental Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency (EPA) conform with the hard-water tolerance requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and therefore can maintain activity at a water-hardness level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
600 ppm. The comment also stated that pH must be reduced below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.5 before the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decreased to any significant extent (Ref. 1). The comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that, because normal potable water supplies do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach these levels for either hardness or acidity, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in proposed &sect;333.92(c)(6) for diluting only with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distilled water is inappropriate and needless. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the tentative final monograph, the agency acknowledged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that hard water and acidity reduce the antimicrobial activity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quaternary ammonium compounds, but that there are some newer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
synthesized quaternary ammonium compounds that are not adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by hard water and acidity (43 FR 1210 at 1218, 1219, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1236). However, these newer quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a mixture of three benzalkonium halide compounds with varying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain lengths), while structurally related to benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and methylbenzethonium
chloride 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the quaternary ammonium compounds which the Antimicrobial I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panel reviewed and which the agency proposed as Category III), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not reviewed or categorized by the Panel or the agency and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not included in this rulemaking. (See comment 58, 43 FR 1210 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 1219.) Further, the agency notes that the 50 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quaternary ammonium concentrates that conform with EPA standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are intended for germicidal uses and not for the antiseptic uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are being considered in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is aware that studies have shown that effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acidic water on quaternary ammonium compounds occur only at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilutions containing less than the dosage concentration proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the tentative final monograph (Ref. 2). Higher concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize quaternary ammonium compound inactivation due to pH 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change (Ref. 3). However, it is well known that natural water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies in different areas differ in acidity and hardness. As a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precautionary measure, FDA believes that concentrates of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients considered in this rulemaking should be diluted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distilled water by consumers and health-care professionals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because information about water pH or hardness in any given area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not usually known. Diluting the concentrated quaternary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ammonium compound products addressed in this rulemaking with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distilled water ensures that inactivating factors are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encountered. Therefore, the agency proposes to retain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning statement, ``Dilute with distilled water before use because acidic or hard water may render the product inactive,''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for diluting any Category I quaternary ammonium concentrate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because all the quaternary ammonium compounds remain in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category III at this time, the warning statement is not being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in this tentative final monograph.

K. Comment on Sodium Oxychlorosene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
22. One comment requested that sodium oxychlorosene be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the monograph for use as a topical antiseptic for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treating localized infections, to remove necrotic debris in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
massive infections, as a patient preoperative skin preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and postoperative irrigant, and for the cleansing and disinfection of fistulae, sinus tracts, empyemas, and wounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment included a number of references that recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usage of sodium oxychlorosene (Ref. 1). The comment stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``*&blank;*&blank;* the 25 years of marketing experience, the almost total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of complaints, the number of published articles, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unusual spectrum of organisms reported on, all attest to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety and efficacy of this product.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the data submitted and concludes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the available information does not contain any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well-controlled clinical studies on the effectiveness of sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxychlorosene. In addition, no meaningful scientific information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was presented in regard to safety. Clinical use for a period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years may provide corroborative evidence but is inadequate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support safe use. A good example is hexachlorophene; this drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had been used OTC for many years before more thorough safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies in animals showed that the drug was not as safe as had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been assumed. The agency concludes that the data are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insufficient to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sodium oxychlorosene for OTC topical antiseptic use and therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
places this ingredient in Category III for both safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's detailed evaluation of the data and information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 2).

L. Comments on Triclosan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
23. A number of comments submitted data and information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from microbiological, mutagenicity, metabolism, cross-sensitization, photo-sensitization, and drug experience
studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on triclosan (Ref. 1). The comments stated that the data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information show that triclosan (up to 1.0 percent) is safe and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective and that triclosan should be placed in Category I for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in the categories that were defined in the previous tentative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final monograph, i.e., skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wound protectant, antimicrobial soap, health-care personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwash, patient preoperative skin preparations, and surgical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand scrub. In addition, one comment submitted information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triclosan (0.1 percent) for the treatment of diaper rash and on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triclosan (0.1 percent) combined with benzocaine for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of sunburn (Ref. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment from the manufacturer of triclosan objected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency's expressed concern, as stated in the tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1231 and 1233), that there is a proliferation of products containing triclosan marketed to
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American consumer (Ref. 3). The comment argued that the agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns were without factual basis and submitted sales data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held confidential under 21 CFR 10.20(j)(2)(i)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
d
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), showing that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall sales of triclosan in the U.S. have in fact decreased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 1973 to 1977 and that sales for use in bar soaps and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deodorants have also declined from 1973 to 1977. The comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pointed out that it has exclusive U.S. patent rights for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triclosan and that no license has been, or will be, granted under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these patents. The comment added that to the best of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowledge triclosan is not used in infant clothing, a use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mentioned in the tentative final monograph at 43 FR 1231. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment stated that if triclosan is placed in Category I for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in antimicrobial soaps, it would limit sales of triclosan to OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in antimicrobial and deodorant soaps, underarm deodorants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and registered Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pesticide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. In the future, sales might be extended to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved new drug applications. The comment also pointed out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the statement at 43 FR 1233 about the EPA's Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special Pesticide Review preparing a report on the proliferation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of triclosan-containing products is in error, and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
erroneous statement apparently resulted from a miscommunication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between FDA and EPA staff. The comment concluded that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns about proliferation raised by the agency in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative final monograph should not prevent triclosan from being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed in Category I.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another comment from the manufacturer of triclosan submitted validation reports and raw data from a 2-year chronic
oral toxicity study in rats, and carcinogenicity and reproduction studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and
monkeys by Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories (IBT) (Refs. 4, 5, and 6) and asserted that its validation of the studies
shows that triclosan is safe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments objected to the agency's restriction at 43 FR 1229 that antimicrobial soaps containing triclosan
can only be formulated in a bar soap to be used with water (Ref. 1). The comments argued that such a restriction was not
applied to the other Category III uses of triclosan, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant, and that such a restriction was not recommended
by the Panel in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. The comments suggested that the footnote under ``antimicrobial
soaps'' limiting triclosan to bar soap was probably intended to apply to cloflucarban, which, like triclocarban,
is known for its ``physical and/or chemical incompatibility.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to safety, the agency evaluated the validation reports to support long-term use of the ingredient (Refs.
4, 5, and 6) and advised the manufacturer of triclosan that the IBT studies were invalid because of numerous problems.
The agency's detailed comments and evaluation on the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 7).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manufacturer subsequently stated its intent to no longer rely on the 2-year chronic oral toxicity IBT study (Ref.
8), and submitted a final report from a new 2-year chronic oral toxicity study in rats (Ref. 9). The agency has determined
that the study data are unacceptable as the sole evidence of the safety of the long-term use of triclosan as a health-care
personnel handwash or surgical handscrub based on the marginal survival of the animals in both the control and treated
groups and uncertainties about the dose and study conduct. Therefore, data from another chronic exposure study are
necessary to assess the safety of the long-term use of triclosan. The agency's detailed comments and evaluation of
the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 10). A subsequent submission from the same manufacturer
contained the final report of a two-generation study of the reproductive toxicity of triclosan in rats (Ref. 11).
These data are currently being reviewed by the agency and will be discussed in the final rule for these drug products.
Triclosan remains classified as Category III for safety for long-term use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concluded in the amended tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644
at 33665) that triclosan (in concentrations up to 1.0 percent) is safe for short term use as a first aid antiseptic (formerly
designated as skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant). The data reviewed (Ref. 1) also support
the safety of triclosan (up to 1.0 percent) for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation. However, with regard
to safety for use as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and surgical hand scrub, triclosan
remains classified in Category III for safety for long-term use, as stated above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to effectiveness, in the previous tentative final monograph the agency classified triclosan as Category
II for use as a health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub because
triclosan has limited activity against gram-negative bacteria. For example, triclosan is the subject of a patent
(patent No. 3,616,256) for use in culture media for isolating 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Because human skin is regarded as a superb ``culture medium,'' the possibility was raised (43 FR 1210 at 1232) that
triclosan might selectively promote overgrowth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on the hands of health-care personnel. Based upon data reviewed, the agency advised that in vitro data demonstrate
that triclosan's antibacterial spectrum can be broadened, to be effective against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 when triclosan is properly formulated with anionic surfactants to form a ``synergistic mixture.'' Therefore, FDA
reclassified triclosan (up to 1.0 percent, with the lower limit to be determined) from Category II to Category III
for effectiveness. The agency further advised that additional studies are needed before triclosan can be generally
recognized as effective for specific uses, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, surgical hand scrub, health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and first aid uses
(formerly designated as skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant). The agency's detailed
comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 12).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the agency's comments (Ref. 12), the manufacturer of triclosan requested further guidance, and asserted,
``The overall antimicrobial effectiveness of a topically applied product is a function of the total formulation
rather than a single ingredient. Although it is impossible to anticipate and test all possible formulations, adequate
in vivo evaluations of triclosan-containing formulations for specific end uses are available to fully justify Category
I status for triclosan as an active ingredient in surgical hand scrubs, health-care personnel handwashes, and antimicrobial
soaps.'' The comment submitted effectiveness data from four in vivo studies on formulations of triclosan (Ref. 13).
These data included three previously unsubmitted studies (RDP/19/23 (June 24, 1981), RDP/19/21 (February 2, 1981),
and CAB/AVD (February 2, 1982)), and one previously submitted study (66&hyph;D15&hyph;W221, OTC Volume 020038)
that had been reviewed by the Panel (39 FR 33128). In study

RDP/19/23 (June 24, 1981)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, following modified glove juice test procedures, a test product (0.5 percent triclosan in 60 percent n-propyl alcohol)
and a control (60 percent n-propyl alcohol) were compared for reduction of normal baseline flora and persistence
of that reduction for 3 hours on the hands of 15 test subjects. The test product (0.5 percent triclosan in 60 percent
n-propyl alcohol) and the control (60 percent n-propyl alcohol) immediately reduced approximately 99.5 percent
of the baseline number of bacteria. After 3 hours, 0.5 percent triclosan in 60 percent n-propyl alcohol suppressed
the baseline count better than the vehicle control; for example the test product allowed about a onefold increase
in bacterial count within 3 hours, while the vehicle control (60 percent n-propyl alcohol) allowed an approximately
twelvefold increase. Although the test used was not the glove juice test described in the antimicrobial tentative
final monograph, alternative methods are acceptable, provided criteria meet those of the glove juice test procedures
described in the guidelines. (See ``Effectiveness Testing of Surgical Hand Scrub (Glove Juice Test),'' 43 FR 1210
at 1242.) The agency has the following comments regarding the protocol for the study: only 15 subjects (an insufficient
number) were tested; a baseline count from 3 samplings was not established before the test; the log

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction in bacteria from baseline was determined after 3 hours, but not after 6 hours; and the results of the test
were not analyzed statistically.

 soap without triclosan, as a control, to show reduction of baseline counts on the hands of five human test subjects
after 5 days. Using the Quinn Split-Use Modification of the Price-Cade Method, increased skin-degerming activity
was shown after 3 days of repeated (10) applications of triclosan as compared to the control. However, the number of
test subjects (5) is not adequate to demonstrate general recognition of effectiveness. (See the ``Modified Cade
Procedure,'' 43 FR 1210 at 1243.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concludes that the data (Ref. 13) discussed above indicate that formulations of triclosan significantly
reduce the baseline count of bacterial skin flora. However, before triclosan may be generally recognized as an effective
health-care antiseptic for use in antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative
skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub drug products, additional in vivo data, i.e., glove juice test data, are
needed. The in vivo data should correlate with data obtained from in vitro studies. Because of the nature of the intended
uses of health-care antiseptic drug products, the agency believes it is essential to assure the effectiveness of
the active ingredient, triclosan, in final formulations. To demonstrate effectiveness in vitro, information is
needed on the germicidal activity of the vehicle alone, so that the germicidal contribution of triclosan attributed
to the total effectiveness of the finished formulation can be determined. (See section I.N., comment 28.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, triclosan (up to 1 percent, with the lower limit to be determined) is being classified as Category III
for use in health-care antiseptic drug products as a patient preoperative skin preparation, antiseptic handwash
or health-care personnel handwash, and surgical hand scrub. The agency's conclusions are summarized below:

The agency has communicated further with EPA and has ascertained that there is no specific report on the proliferation
of triclosan (Ref. 14). Regarding exclusive patent rights, the agency advises that these are not among the determining
criteria to establish general recognition of safety and effectiveness, and therefore cannot be used in the evaluation.
However, having reviewed the new data along with the previously submitted data, the agency concludes that there is
no proliferation problem with triclosan.

Finally, the agency did not intend to restrict formulations of triclosan to bar soap. The agency has reviewed the Panel's
recommendations and the footnotes in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1229) and finds that triclosan
under ``antimicrobial soaps'' was erroneously marked with the reference to the footnote ``Category III only when
formulated in a bar soap to be used with water.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of triclosan in products for the treatment of diaper rash was discussed in the tentative final monograph for
antimicrobial diaper rash drug products published on June 20, 1990 (55 FR 25246 at 25277 to 25278). The use of triclosan
in products for treating sunburn will be addressed in the

M. Comments on Combinations of Active Ingredients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
24. One comment stated that the Panel did not review safety and effectiveness data submitted to it on mercufenol chloride
(orthohydroxyphenylmercuric chloride) 0.1 percent and secondary amyltricresols 0.1 percent as single ingredients
and in combination for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation, skin antiseptic, and skin wound protectant
(Ref. 1). The comment added that the agency did not discuss these ingredients alone or in combination in the previous
tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment asserted that secondary amyltricresols, mentioned in the previous tentative final monograph under
phenol (43 FR 1210 at 1238), is not equivalent to phenol because of chemical differences and differing antimicrobial
properties, formulation concentrations, and patterns of use. The comment requested the agency to make decisions
on the safety and effectiveness of this ingredient when used alone, or in combination, as a patient preoperative skin
preparation, a skin antiseptic, or a skin wound protectant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has previously reviewed data for first aid antiseptic uses of 0.1 percent mercufenol chloride and 0.1 percent
secondary amyltricresols and found the evidence insufficient to support their safety and effectiveness either
as single ingredients or in combination (56 FR 33644 at 33668). Only safety data on animals were submitted by the comment
(Ref. 1); in general, these studies were conducted on a very small number of animals, did not detail methodology, and
did not adequately describe results (physical condition of the animals). The submitted in vitro studies also lack
sufficient detail to establish the effectiveness of mercufenol chloride.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Secondary amyltricresols is a mixture of isomeric secondary amyltricresols, which are derivatives of phenol, and
has pharmacological properties similar to phenol. The agency agrees with the comment that the mixture of secondary
amyltricresols is not equivalent to phenol and should be categorized separately from phenol. The submitted safety
data included a study by Broom (Ref. 2), who reported that amylmetacresol is relatively nontoxic and less toxic than
hexylresorcinol in rats and mice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No toxicity studies in humans were included in the information provided by the comment. However, in the tentative
final monograph for OTC external analgesic drug products, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5852 at 5858), the agency proposed that metacresol up to a 3.6-percent concentration be considered
safe when combined with camphor and that a 3-to-1 ratio of camphor to metacresol reduces the irritating properties
of metacresol. Although cresols may cause some irritation when applied to minor wounds, the agency believes that
secondary amyltricresols at the concentration requested (0.1 percent) would not present any safety concerns, particularly
considering the short-term use of antiseptics as patient preoperative skin preparation drug products. The submitted
data are, however, inadequate to establish the efficacy of secondary amyltricresols. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data are also needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of mercufenol chloride and secondary
amyltricresols. Only animal safety data are available, and these studies were limited to determinations of the minimum
lethal dose by various routes of administration (Ref. 1). The submitted information on marketing history is not sufficient
to provide general recognition of the safety of these ingredients. The data contained isolated reports of the combination
of mercufenol chloride and secondary amyltricresols causing occasional skin irritation, such as burning and blistering
(Ref. 1), adverse effects that need to be more fully studied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the effectiveness work on the combination of mercufenol chloride and secondary amyltricresols has been in
vitro. The combination is reported to combine the antibacterial activity of the single ingredients, that is, mercufenol
chloride which is primarily active against gram-negative organisms and secondary amyltricresols which is primarily
active against gram-positive organisms (Ref. 3). One in vivo study on the effectiveness of the combination as a patient
preoperative skin preparation showed a substantial reduction in the skin microflora (Ref. 4). However, because
neutralizers were not used, bacteriocidal activity cannot be differentiated from residual bacteriostatic activity.
In addition, the effect of the 50-percent alcohol in the alcohol-acetone vehicle was not taken into consideration.
Alcohol, 60 to 95 percent, is in Category I for antiseptic health-care uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the agency's guidelines for OTC drug combination products (Ref. 5), Category I active ingredients from the
same therapeutic category that have different mechanisms of action may be combined to treat the same symptoms or condition
if the combination meets the OTC combination policy in all respects and the combination is on a benefit-risk basis,
equal to or better than each of the active ingredients used alone at its therapeutic dose. Accordingly, both mercufenol
chloride and secondary amyltricresols and the combination of these ingredients are placed in Category III. The combination
needs further testing of the combined ingredients compared to each individual active ingredient to establish effectiveness
of the combination as a patient preoperative skin preparation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recommends that in vivo and in vitro effectiveness data be submitted. The data should be based on both in
vitro and in vivo testing procedures as described for patient preoperative skin preparation drug products. (See
section I.N., comment 28.)

25. One comment submitted data on a combination drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product containing calomel (mercurous chloride) 30 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxyquinoline benzoate, and trolamine (triethanolamine) combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with fatty acids to form a soap compound, plus a phenol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derivative that is currently marketed over-the-counter and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated for use in the prevention of venereal disease (syphilis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and gonorrhea) (Ref. 1). The comment included a historical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and information on in vitro activity of one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients. According to the comment, in 1905 the discovery was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made that calomel in combination with fats is an effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
germicide against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Treponema pallidum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T. pallidum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the causative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organism of syphilis. Later, calomel was stated to be active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Neisseria gonorrhoeae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. gonorrhoeae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (the causative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organism of gonorrhea). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This combination of ingredients and the indication of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevention of syphilis and gonorrhea have not been reviewed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any OTC advisory review panel. However, because a claim is made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating antimicrobial activity and the product contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calomel, which is already included in the rulemaking for OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical antimicrobial drug products, the agency believes it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to review this combination and labeling claim in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The in vitro effectiveness test described in the comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 1) is a zone of inhibition test comparing the germicidal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity of calomel, phenol, and organic silver salts against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as an indicator of activity against syphilis (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pallidum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and gonorrhea (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. gonorrhoeae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). According to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission, the causative organisms are not viable in vitro and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not used in the testing. The agency points out that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible to isolate and subculture isolates of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. gonorrhoeae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in vitro antimicrobial testing (Ref. 2), but 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T. pallidum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be grown in vitro (Ref. 3). The agency does not consider the in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vitro test against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to be adequate to support a claim of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevention of syphilis and gonorrhea. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a separate rulemaking for mercury-containing drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products for topical antimicrobial use, calomel was reviewed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Miscellaneous External Panel (47 FR 436 at 440). That Panel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did note that calomel ``has been used in the past by inunction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(rubbing into the skin) as a prophylactic against venereal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease *&blank;*&blank;*'' but placed the ingredient in Category II because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``calomel may be safe as a topical antimicrobial agent, but it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not effective for this purpose.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although it is apparent that calomel 30 percent would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered an active ingredient, it is not clear from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available information whether the other ingredients in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination (oxyquinoline benzoate, trolamine, and phenol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derivative) are also considered active ingredients, nor are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of these other ingredients stated in the submission and no data have been submitted to the OTC drug
review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on these ingredients in relation to the prevention of venereal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease. In the absence of any data, none of these ingredients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are considered safe and effective for this use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment did not submit any in vivo data from clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies to demonstrate that the combination of calomel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxyquinoline benzoate, trolamine, and phenol derivative is safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and effective for use in the prevention of syphilis and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gonorrhea. Preliminary in vitro testing against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N. gonorrhoeae 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be conducted before any human clinical trials are done. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Then, favorable results from two well-controlled clinical studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in humans conducted by qualified investigators in two geographic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations (at least one should be within the United States of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
America) are needed before any drug product can be recognized to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be safe and effective in preventing syphilis and gonorrhea. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested individuals should consult with the agency before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiating any testing. In conclusion, the agency is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this combination of ingredients indicated for the prevention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of syphilis and gonorrhea be classified Category II in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's detailed comments and evaluation on the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 4).

N. Comments on Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
26. Numerous comments addressed the agency's modifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Panel's proposed testing guidelines (43 FR 1210 at 1239 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1240), the agency's statements on final formulation testing (43 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 1211, 1224, and 1240), and specific protocols for upgrading an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial ingredient from Category III to Category I (43 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1242 to 1246). Stating that the testing guidelines were unclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in some places and pointing out inconsistencies between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines and the agency's responses to comments at 43 FR 1211 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 1223 to 1227, a number of comments requested clarification or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed modifications of a number of items in the guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments requested specific information or submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protocols for testing Category III ingredients. One comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested that manufacturers be permitted to determine which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protocol to follow to establish safety or effectiveness of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient. A number of comments objected to the agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of the testing guidelines as final, and urged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revisions in the guidelines for publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency acknowledges that there were some inconsistencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the testing guidelines for safety and effectiveness proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the previous tentative final rule. The agency does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider the previous testing guidelines as final. The agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifying in this amended tentative final monograph that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final formulations will be required to meet the specifications in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final monograph. As stated in section I.N., comment 28, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is proposing testing procedures in &sect;333.470 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating the active ingredient in pure form as well as in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete formulation. The agency recommends that manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use these procedures for testing the final formulations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products intended for health-care antiseptic use. Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may propose other appropriate testing procedures subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency evaluation, as requested. The data from these tests are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not required to be submitted to FDA by the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the agency intends to use these procedures for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary compliance testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. Two comments pointed out an apparent conflict in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's statements concerning safety factor calculations as follows: At 43 FR 1240, the agency concluded that a
minimum of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100-fold safety factor should apply to the exposure dose for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients labeled for repeated daily use; at 43 FR 1241, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency stated that if the safety factor is extrapolated from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animal species to man, considering surface area, the highest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no-effect dose should be used for the multiplier, and in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of complete data, a 100-fold safety factor should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied when translating the animal highest no-effect dose to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
man; and at 43 FR 1213 (see comment 19), the agency stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications of the safety factor will be allowed for specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients where justified by risk-benefit considerations. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment suggested that a safety factor of less than 100-fold be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable when scientific investigation of good quality shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the test animals used in establishing the no-effect dose are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to humans with respect to metabolism (biotransformation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and pharmacokinetics) and/or tissue susceptibility. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment stated that a more reasoned and practical approach would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be to require calculation of certain safety factors as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended, and indicate in a general guideline that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk-benefit ratios based on these factors would determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative merits of the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency does not find any conflict in the various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements included in the previous tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety factor calculations were included merely as a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guideline. The agency's response to comment 19 at 43 FR 1213 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that the agency would retain a minimum of a 100-fold safety factor applied to the exposure dose for ingredients
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products labeled for repeated daily use. However, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will consider modifications of the safety factor for specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients where justified by risk-benefit considerations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where requests are based on submitted data. While the 100-fold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety factor was a general guideline in the previous tentative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final monograph, the agency does not find a need to include a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general guideline in this amended tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. Numerous comments requested clarification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria required to establish effectiveness for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial product class. One comment stated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Testing Guidelines'' section seems to indicate that it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to determine the effect of the vehicle on the active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient. The comment contended that this provision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confusing because the preamble discussion in the tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph indicates that vehicle testing will not be necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``*&blank;*&blank;* where adequate data are available on the active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients alone.'' (See 43 FR 1210 at 1224.) Another comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the Cade handwashing test can only be conducted if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the antimicrobial is placed in a vehicle and noted that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial is never used by consumers in its raw form; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, efficacy testing on the raw antimicrobial ingredient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be required. A third comment stated that the overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial effectiveness of a topically applied product is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function of the total formulation rather than a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient. Another comment added that if an individual product formulation must be tested, and/or the testing of
a product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle is considered essential, then such testing requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be specifically described. Citing the definition of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic in section 201(o) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(o)), one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment asserted that the definition requires that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial product kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms on the skin. The comment proposed that efficacy
can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated by showing that the preparation produces a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative reduction in the levels of normal skin flora and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhibition of bacterial growth in vitro. Two comments pointed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out that the ``Modified Cade Procedure'' handwashing test (43 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1210 at 1243) specifies a one-log reduction of bacteria, but the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure fails to indicate how many uses or days of use of test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product should produce the reduction. Other comments requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no upper limit be set for bacterial hand counts, that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower limit of 1.5&times;106 per hand be the only criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject selection, and that minimal hand count reduction be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in the test protocols for surgical hand scrub and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash products. Another comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that modification of the ``Sampling technique and times'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(paragraph 6) of the protocol ``Effectiveness Testing of Surgical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hand Scrub (Glove Juice Test)'' (43 FR 1243) was needed because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the protocol did not indicate the volume of sampling solution but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only stated that the volume *&blank;*&blank;* should be ``kept constant'' for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all tests. The comment recommended that the agency specify a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of 50 to 100 mL of sampling solution in order to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent and reproducible results.

The agency has carefully reviewed the comments, existing data, and other information, and is clarifying the effectiveness
criteria for health-care antiseptics in this tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for an antiseptic ingredient to be generally recognized as effective for use as an antiseptic handwash or
health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and/or surgical hand scrub, it must have
existing data from well designed clinical studies demonstrating effectiveness. The agency believes that it is important
to correlate effectiveness data from clinical studies with effectiveness data from in vitro studies on the activity
of the vehicle and active ingredient individually, so that the germicidal contribution of the antiseptic ingredient
to the total formulation can be fully characterized. As stated in the testing guidelines in the previous tentative
final monograph, at 43 FR 1240, ``*&blank;*&blank;* there should be demonstration that the formulated product is
better than the vehicle alone. Testing of the complete formulation of Category III ingredients *&blank;*&blank;*
is necessary to judge the importance of the vehicle in the release of the active ingredient as well as the influence
of formulation on aspects of effectiveness *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The agency believes that information on the in
vitro activity of the active ingredient alone helps to characterize its antiseptic activity independent of formulation
and helps to further define formulation effects on the antimicrobial ingredient. Therefore, the agency is proposing
that in vitro studies of the antimicrobial activity of health-care antiseptic drug products covered by &sect;333.470(a)(1)(i)
and (a)(1)(ii) be conducted on the active ingredient, the vehicle, and the final formulation. Manufacturers are
to have such data in their files for products containing ingredients included in the monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this amended tentative final monograph, the agency is proposing that the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the
antiseptic ingredient, the vehicle, and the formulated product be characterized by the determination of their antimicrobial
spectrum and by minimal inhibitory concentration determinations performed against selected organisms using methodology
established by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratories Standards (NCCLS) (Ref. 1). Because the principal
intended use of these health-care antiseptic drug products is the prevention of nosocomial or hospital acquired
infections, the agency concludes that these products should be able to demonstrate in vitro activity against a microbial
spectrum that reflects this use. Since 1970, the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System (NNIS) has collected
and analyzed data on nosocomial pathogens reported to the Centers for Disease Control by a number of hospitals who
perform prospective surveillance on nosocomial infections. These data provide an indication of the most frequently
occurring pathogens at four major sites of nosocomial infection_the urinary tract, surgical wounds, lungs (pneumonia),
and bloodstream. The agency believes that health-care personnel handwash, surgical hand scrub, and patient preoperative
skin preparations should be able to demonstrate in vitro effectiveness against these pathogens as well as the normal
resident skin flora. Therefore, the agency is proposing that micro-organisms associated with the most commonly
occurring nosocomial infections and those found most often in nosocomial infections of high risk patients as reported
by the NNIS, for the period from January 1985 through August 1988 (Ref. 2), be included in the list of micro-organisms
to be tested in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii). The agency further concludes that this proposed list identifies a broad
spectrum of antimicrobial activity that is also appropriate for home use antiseptic handwash products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that neither filamentous dermatophytic fungi or viruses are included in the NNIS report. More recent
studies (Refs. 3 and 4) have reported small numbers of nosocomial infections associated with both of these organisms.
However, the new studies do not provide sufficient information to assess the relative importance of these organisms
as a cause of nosocomial infection. Therefore, the agency is not proposing to include filamentous dermatophytic
fungi in the list of micro-organisms to be tested, as proposed in the previous in vitro effectiveness testing guidelines
(43 FR 1210 at 1241) and is continuing to propose that viruses also not be included. The agency recognizes that the list
of organisms to be tested may need updating to assure that it remains reflective of current trends in the microbial
etiology of nosocomial infections. The agency intends to update the list as new information becomes available. Further,
the agency invites the submission of comments and specifically data on the role of other organisms, particularly
viruses and filamentous dermatophytic fungi, in nosocomial infections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the characterization of the in vitro spectrum of activity, the agency believes that information on
how rapidly these antimicrobial drug products achieve their antimicrobial effect is necessary. As a means of indicating
how quickly these products achieve their antimicrobial effect, the agency is proposing in vitro time-kill curves
of the formulated drug product as part of the testing requirements. The agency acknowledges that there is currently
no accepted or standardized method that may be used in conducting this type of study and invites the submission of proposed
methods that may be considered as applicable to this test. In &sect;333.470(a)(1)(iv) of the proposed testing regulations,
the agency provides guidance on the development of such methods. However, any time-kill studies submitted to the
agency are to be conducted on a 10-fold dilution of the formulated product against the ATCC strains identified in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii)
of the proposed testing regulations and are to include enumeration at times at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 30 minutes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to proof of clinical effectiveness, the agency is proposing specific criteria for final formulations
of antiseptic handwashes or health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative skin preparations, and surgical
hand scrubs that are based on the recommendations of the Panel and agency experience in evaluating the effectiveness
of these types of drug products, as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash products, the agency is proposing the following criteria:
(1) A 2-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of the indicator organism on each hand within 5 minutes after the first wash and (2) a 3-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction in the indicator organism on each hand within 5 minutes after the tenth wash, when tested by a modification
of the standard procedure for the evaluation of health-care personnel handwash formulations published by the American
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) (Ref. 5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For patient preoperative skin preparations, the agency is proposing the following criteria: (1) A 2-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of the microbial flora per square centimeter of an abdominal test site, (2) a 3-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of the microbial flora per square centimeter of a groin test site within 10 minutes from a matched control
area, and (3) the suppression of bacterial growth below baseline for 6 hours, when tested by a modification of the standard
procedure for the evaluation of patient preoperative skin preparations published by the ASTM (Ref. 6). The agency
believes that the revised effectiveness criteria more closely reflect the conditions of product use, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, on a number of different body sites, each supporting different numbers of resident skin flora. In addition, although
persistence of effect was not recommended by the Panel as a requirement for these drug products, the agency believes
that persistence of antimicrobial effect would suppress the growth of residual skin flora not removed by preoperative
prepping as well as transient micro-organisms inadvertently added to the operative field during the course of surgery
and reduce the risk of surgical wound infection. Based on the proposed effectiveness criteria for this product class,
the agency is proposing a revised definition of a patient preoperative skin preparation drug product in &sect;333.403(c)(2)
of this amended tentative final monograph as follows: ``A fast-acting broad-spectrum persistent antiseptic-containing
preparation that significantly reduces the number of micro-organisms on intact skin.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in section I.E., comment 10, the agency is proposing the indication ``for the preparation of the skin
prior to an injection'' for OTC alcohol and isopropyl alcohol drug products. The agency is further proposing that
products labeled for such use demonstrate effectiveness by testing according to the same procedure used to demonstrate
the effectiveness of patient preoperative skin preparation drug products not labeled for this use. Based on this
intended use of alcohol drug products, the agency is proposing a 1-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction in the microbial flora per square centimeter of a dry skin test site within 30 seconds of product use as the
effectiveness criteria for these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For surgical hand scrub products, the agency is proposing the following criteria: (1) A 1-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of the microbial flora of each hand from the baseline count within 1 minute, (2) suppression of bacterial
growth on each hand below baseline for 6 hours on the first day, (3) a 2-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of the microbial flora on each hand within 1 minute of product use by the end of the second day, and (4) a 3-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction of the microbial flora on each hand within 1 minute of product use by the end of the fifth day, when tested by
a modification of the standard procedure for the evaluation of surgical hand scrub products published by the ASTM
(Ref. 7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on glove juice test data for surgical hand scrub use of povidone-iodine (section I.I., comment 17), alcohol
(section I.E., comment 10), chloroxylenol (section I.G., comment 12), and triclosan (section I.L., comment 23),
the agency concludes that formulated products containing certain ingredients, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, chloroxylenol and triclosan, are substantive in their action and do not produce a high (1-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) initial reduction, but after repeated use for up to 5 days do reduce the baseline count and suppress the count in the
user's glove. In a separate final rule, the agency stated that any product indicated for use as a surgical scrub should
meet a standard for initial reduction. A one-log reduction was found acceptable as the minimal level of reduction
suitable for a surgical scrub in a handwashing test. (See ``New Drugs Containing Hexachlorophene,'' published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 20, 1977; 42 FR 63771.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In that same final rule, the agency acknowledged that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hexachlorophene containing surgical scrub drug products are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantive in their action and do not produce an initial high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction but with repeated use are effective in reducing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident skin flora and suppressing bacterial growth in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
user's glove for up to 6 hours. Based on a lack of available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products capable of producing both an initial high reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the resident skin flora and a prolonged microbial suppression 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketed at the time of the agency's action on the ingredient in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1972, the agency agreed with the recommendations of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Antimicrobial I Panel and concluded that the ingredient should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be marketed for use as a surgical scrub and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwashing as part of patient care. The agency stated its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intention to reconsider its criteria for evaluating such products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in light of risk-benefit judgments as new products containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both attributes become available (42 FR 63771). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since that final rule was issued in 1977, data have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the agency demonstrating the effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgical hand scrub formulations capable of producing an initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1-log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction and a suppression of microbial growth in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wearer's glove for up to 6 hours. (See section I.E., comment 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on alcohol and section I.I., comment 17 on povidone-iodine.) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency notes that the persistence of the antimicrobial effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated by an alcohol-containing surgical hand scrub 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation was provided by a preservative agent in the vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the new data, the agency has concerns about the risk associated with the initial use of substantive surgical
hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrub formulations, and with the use of these formulations after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended lapses in their routine use. Therefore, the agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing that all surgical hand scrub formulations must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate an initial one-log reduction in the bacterial flora. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency invites comment on the use of substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobials in health-care antiseptic drug products. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the revised effectiveness criterion for these drug products, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is proposing a revised definition of a surgical hand scrub 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug product in &sect;333.403(c)(3) as follows: ``An antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing preparation that significantly reduces the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
micro-organisms on intact skin; it is broad spectrum, fast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acting, and persistent.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that the modified ASTM procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the testing of health-care or antiseptic handwashes, surgical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand scrubs, and patient preoperative skin preps being proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for inclusion in the testing requirements provide protocols that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are appropriate for the final formulation testing of these drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. The proposed protocols describe, in detail, study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions and materials to be used and address the concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raised by the comments. For instance, the proposed protocol for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the testing of surgical hand scrub products includes a baseline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion for subject selection of equal to, or greater than, 1.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&times; 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 bacteria per hand and specifies that a 50 to 100 mL volume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of sampling is to be used. The proposed protocols also specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for a number of areas not addressed by the testing guidelines proposed in the previous tentative final
monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, they address statistical aspects of study design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data analysis, and the use of neutralizers. A positive control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is included in the protocols as a means of validating the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure, equipment, and facilities. The agency believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed protocols for the testing of these products provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a consistent approach to the effectiveness testing of health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel handwashes, surgical hand scrubs, and patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparations. The agency is incorporating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above criteria and testing requirements in proposed &sect;333.470 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this tentative final monograph and invites specific comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them at this time. After reviewing any submitted comments or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data, the agency may revise the testing requirements and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures prior to establishing a final monograph. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also recognizes that the test procedures may need to be revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodically to reflect new information and newer techniques that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are developed and proven adequate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has carefully reviewed the claimed active ingredients submitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this administrative record (Docket No. 75N&hyph;0183), which includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following: the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (39 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33103) and previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTC topical antimicrobial drug products, the advance notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rulemaking for OTC topical alcohol drug products (47 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22324), and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical mercury-containing drug products (47 FR 436). Based upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the available information, including clinical and marketing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history, as well as the recommendations of the Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
External Panel, the agency is proposing a tentative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classification for OTC health-care antiseptic active ingredients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the ingredients included in the tabulation below are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Category II and Category III because of no data or a lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data on use as a health-care antiseptic. However, all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients have been included as a convenience to the reader. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency specifically invites comment and additional data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these ingredients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The advance notice of proposed rulemaking for alcohol drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products for topical antimicrobial OTC human use (47 FR 22324, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 21, 1982) is being incorporated into this amended tentative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final monograph. In that proposed monograph, the Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
External Panel recommended that alcohol 60 to 95 percent by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume in an aqueous solution denatured according to Bureau of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms regulations at 27 CFR part 21 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isopropyl alcohol 50 to 91.3 percent by volume in an aqueous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solution be classified as Category I for topical antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. The following indications were proposed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ``For first aid use to decrease germs in minor cuts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrapes.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ``To decrease germs on the skin prior to removing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splinter or other foreign object.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) ``For preparation of the skin prior to an injection.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC alcohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug products for topical antimicrobial use, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of May 21, 1982, 47 FR 22324.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon submitted data and the conclusions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Miscellaneous External Panel, the agency is including alcohol as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Category I surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwash (see section I.E., comment 10). While no comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted data on health-care uses of isopropyl alcohol, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency notes that one comment (Ref. 1) from a manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested that the OTC alcohol drug products monograph provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the labeling indication, ``antibacterial handwash.'' The same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer provided a submission (Ref. 2) to the Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
External Panel on a combination product containing isopropyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol 50 percent and oxyquinoline sulfate 0.125 percent for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a germicidal-fungicidal wash. However, the Panel disbanded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before it was able to review the submission, which contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling for a currently marketed product and in vitro studies of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product's bacteriocidal activity. No in vivo effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data were submitted for the use of isopropyl alcohol as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparation, or surgical hand scrub. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the lack of data for the use of isopropyl alcohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgical hand scrub, the agency is placing the ingredient in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category III for these uses. The agency invites data on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses of isopropyl alcohol. As discussed in section I.E., comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10, the agency is including the Panel's recommended indication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``for the preparation of the skin prior to an injection'' as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional Category I indication for patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparations containing alcohol. Based on the Panel's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations, the agency is also proposing isopropyl alcohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a Category I patient preoperative skin preparation for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication. However, based on the lack of data on the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isopropyl alcohol for more general patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation use, the agency is not proposing isopropyl alcohol as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category I for the other patient preoperative skin preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indications included in &sect;333.460(b)(1), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of the skin prior to surgery'' and ``helps to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteria that potentially can cause skin infection.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has evaluated standard textbooks and published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data on the effectiveness of isopropyl alcohol used topically on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the area prior to an injection (Refs. 3, 4, and 5). The minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective concentration of isopropyl alcohol for this use is 70 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent. Further, the agency is not aware of any information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the use of isopropyl alcohol below 70 percent for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indication. Therefore, the agency is proposing to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isopropyl alcohol 70 to 91.3 percent in Category I for use as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient preoperative skin preparation for the limited indication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``for the preparation of the skin prior to an injection''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Miscellaneous External Panel recommended that drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products containing alcohol and isopropyl alcohol bear the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following warning: ``Flammable, keep away from fire or flame,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(47 FR 22324 at 22330). The agency concurs with the Panel's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended warning and is proposing this warning in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.450(c)(4) of this tentative final monograph. In order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure the warning's prominence, the agency is further proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it appear in boldface type and as the first warning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately following the heading ``WARNINGS''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is aware of ten reports (Refs. 6 and 7) of first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and second degree burns occurring in patients undergoing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrocautery procedures. The burns were caused by the ignition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the isopropyl alcohol in patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparations containing chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iodine in 70 percent isopropyl alcohol. The reports indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that these incidents have occurred despite the presence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detailed warnings in the products' labeling cautioning that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products are flammable until dry and should not be allowed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pool on body surfaces or should not be used in conjunction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrocautery procedures until dry (Refs. 8 and 9). Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these reports, the agency tentatively concludes that patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparations containing isopropyl alcohol in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of 70 percent or more cannot be adequately labeled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to allow the safe use of these drug products in conjunction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrocautery procedures. Therefore, the agency is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that patient preoperative skin preparations containing isopropyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol in concentrations of 70 percent or more bear the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following label warning: ``Do not use with electrocautery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures.'' The agency is further proposing that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning immediately follow the flammable warning being proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;333.450(c)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is not currently aware of any similar incidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurring with other nonemollient patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparations containing alcohol in similar concentrations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, at this time the agency is not proposing that patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparations containing alcohol identified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.412(a) bear a warning concerning the use of these products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in conjunction with electrocautery procedures. However, the agency will consider extending the warning to patient

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative skin preparations containing alcohol if new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information indicates that this is necessary. The agency invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific comment and data on the safety of both alcohol and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isopropyl alcohol containing patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparations in conjunction with electrocautery procedures.

The Panel also stated that benzyl alcohol and chlorobutanol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were safe, but recommended that the ingredients be categorized as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category II for effectiveness. However, in the first aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic segment of this rulemaking these alcohol ingredients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were reclassified from Category II to Category III for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness as first aid antiseptic ingredients. (See 56 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33644 at 33673.) Because no comments, data, or information were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received, and because the agency is not aware of any health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic uses for these ingredients, benzyl alcohol and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chlorobutanol are not being classified in this rulemaking for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care antiseptic drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency published an advance notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking for mercury-containing drug products on January 5, 1982 (47 FR 436). That notice, based upon the recommendations
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Miscellaneous External Panel, proposed to classify OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mercury-containing drug products for topical antimicrobial use as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not generally recognized as safe and effective and as being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misbranded. The agency received no comments. The Panel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified the mercurial ingredients, as a group, in Category II; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some for lack of safety, some for lack of efficacy, and others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to a lack of both safety and efficacy. However, in the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid antiseptic segment of this amended tentative final monograph, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several mercury-containing OTC topical antimicrobials have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reclassified from Category II to Category III for effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mercurial ingredients placed in Category II for safety were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reclassified. The ingredients reclassified are calomel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merbromin, mercufenol chloride, and phenylmercuric nitrate. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change was made in keeping with the revised effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for the drug product category ``first aid antiseptic,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which were not available at the time the Miscellaneous External 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panel evaluated the effectiveness of mercurial ingredients. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
56 FR 33644 at 33672.) The agency is unaware of any clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data or marketing history for the use of mercury-containing drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products as health-care antiseptics. Consequently, these drugs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have not been classified as health-care antiseptics. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the agency has reviewed submitted data on two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combinations containing mercurial ingredients and proposes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category II classification for these combinations. (See section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I.M., comments 24 and 25.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the previous tentative final monograph, the agency concluded that cloflucarban and triclocarban are not generally
recognized as safe and effective for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation, surgical hand scrub, and health-care
personnel handwash. The Panel reviewed safety and effectiveness data on these ingredients formulated as a bar soap
and classified them in Category III as a health-care personnel handwash when formulated as a bar soap (39 FR 33103 at
33124 and 33126). No safety and effectiveness data for the use of clofucarban in the other health-care antiseptic
drug product classes were submitted to the OTC drug review; no data were reviewed by the Panel; and no data were received
by the agency. Cloflucarban is therefore considered to be outside this monograph except as a health-care personnel
handwash (formulated as a bar soap). Accordingly, cloflucarban remains Category II as a health-care antiseptic
for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation and surgical scrub and Category III as an antiseptic handwash or
health-care personnel handwash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional safety data and information were submitted to the agency on triclocarban formulated as a soap. As discussed
in the segment of this rulemaking covering first aid antiseptics (56 FR 33644 at 33664), the agency has reviewed a chronic
toxicity study and other information and determined that triclocarban can be recognized as safe for OTC daily topical
use in a concentration of 1.5 percent. However, no effectiveness data were submitted for any health-care antiseptic
uses of this ingredient and the agency is classifying triclocarban in Category III as an antiseptic handwash or health-care
personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub. In the previous tentative
final monograph, the agency placed the combination of cloflucarban and triclocarban in Category III (43 FR 1210 at
1230) to be ``used in antimicrobial soap *&blank;*&blank;*''. No additional data were submitted on this combination.
Therefore, the combination of cloflucarban and triclocarban remains in Category III for antiseptic handwash or
health-care personnel handwash uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the Panel's recommendations on phenol, in the previous tentative final monograph, the agency classified
phenol less than 1.5 percent as Category III and phenol greater than 1.5 percent as Category II for use as a health-care
personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub (43 FR 1227 and 1229). Hexylresorcinol
was also classified in Category III for these uses in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1229). No additional
data were submitted on health-care antiseptic uses of phenol and hexylresorcinol and their classifications are
unchanged in this amended tentative final monograph. In the previous tentative final monograph, the agency classified
triple dye (a combination of gentian violet, brilliant green, and proflavine hemisulfate) in Category II as a health-care
personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub based on a lack of safety data
(43 FR 1239). No additional data have been submitted and the ingredient remains in Category II for health-care antiseptic
uses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comment 85 of the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1223), the agency deferred classification of several
ingredients to the Miscellaneous External Panel. All of the ingredients have been classified with the exception
of methyl alcohol and gentian violet 1 and 2 percent solutions. The Miscellaneous External Panel at its 38th meeting
placed methyl alcohol in Category II as an OTC topical antimicrobial ingredient for both safety and effectiveness
(Ref. 1). However, this classification was not included in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC alcohol
drug products. The agency agrees with this classification. Further, the agency is not aware of any use of methyl alcohol
in OTC drug products, except as a denaturant. Gentian violet was reviewed by the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Oral Cavity
Drug Products and placed in Category III based on the lack of effectiveness data for use as a topical antimicrobial
on the mucous membranes of the mouth. The agency is not aware of any data on the use of gentian violet as a health-care
antiseptic and places this ingredient in Category III for this use.

Fluorosalan was not classified as an OTC topical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial ingredient in the previous tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph because the agency stated that final regulatory action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had been taken against ``*&blank;*&blank;* the halogenated salicylanilides, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly *&blank;*&blank;* fluorosalan (21 CFR 310.508) *&blank;*&blank;*'' (43 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1210 at 1227). Although no comments were received, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notes that fluorosalan was not addressed in the final rule for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
halogenated salicylanilides (21 CFR 310.508), published in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 30, 1975 (40 FR 5027). In reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Antimicrobial I Panel's recommendations, the agency has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the Panel did not intend to include fluorosalan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the group of halogenated salicylanilides which it recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be handled more expeditiously by the agency in a separate

 notice. (See the notice of proposed rulemaking for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain halogenated salicylanilides as active or inactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients in drug and cosmetic products (September 13, 1974, 39 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical antimicrobial drug products (September 13, 1974, 39 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33103 at 33120).) The agency affirms the recommendation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Antimicrobial I Panel (39 FR 33121) that fluorosalan be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified as Category II for use in antiseptic handwash,

health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, and surgical hand scrub drug products.

2. Testing of Category II and Category III Conditions 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Required testing procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of the complete formulation of a health-care antiseptic
drug product are included in proposed &sect;333.470. These effectiveness testing procedures can also be used to
demonstrate the effectiveness of active ingredients not in a final formulation. Suggested safety testing is described
in the previous tentative final monograph. (See 43 FR 1210 at 1240 to 1242.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may communicate with the agency about the submission of data and information to demonstrate the
safety or effectiveness of any health-care antiseptic ingredient or condition included in the review by following
the procedures outlined in the agency's policy statement published in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47740) and clarified April 1, 1983 (48 FR 14050). That policy statement includes procedures
for the submission and review of proposed protocols, agency meetings with industry or other interested persons,
and agency communications on submitted test data and other information.

In addition, a number of format changes have been made that are consistent with the format used in recently published
tentative final and final monographs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
2. The agency is proposing the term ``antiseptic'' as the general statement of identity for the product categories
of patient preoperative skin preparation, surgical hand scrub, and health-care personnel handwash drug products.
The agency is also providing manufacturers the option to provide alternative statements of identity describing
only the specific intended use of the product, e.g., surgical hand scrub. When the term ``antiseptic'' is used as the
only statement of identity on a single-use or a multiple-use product, the intended use(s) is to be included as part
of the indications. For multiple use products the agency proposes that a statement of the intended use(s) should also
precede the specific directions for each use. (See section I.B., comment 3.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The agency is proposing that the statement of identity ``antiseptic handwash'' may also be used for a health-care
personnel handwash. The agency is proposing to expand the indications proposed for health-care personnel handwash
drug products in the previous tentative final monograph to read, ``Handwash to help reduce bacteria that potentially
can cause disease'' or ``For handwashing to decrease bacteria on the skin'' (which may be followed by one or more of
the following: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after assisting ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under
medical care or treatment.'') The agency is also proposing ``recommended for repeated use'' as another allowable
indication for this product class. (See section I.B., comment 5.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The agency has replaced the previously proposed definition of an antimicrobial (active) ingredient with a definition
of an ``antiseptic'' drug that is consistent with the definition of an antiseptic in section 201(o) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(o)). The agency is also including a definition for a health-care antiseptic
as follows: ``An antiseptic containing drug product applied topically to the skin to help prevent infection or to
help prevent cross contamination.'' The agency has also proposed revised definitions for patient preoperative
skin preparations and surgical hand scrubs that reflect the agency's proposed effectiveness criteria for these
products. (See section I.N., comment 28.) In addition, the agency has made minor revisions in the definitions of a
health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub to reflect the
revised terminology being used in this amended tentative final monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The agency is adding to this amended tentative final monograph a definition of broad spectrum activity as follows:
A properly formulated drug product, containing an ingredient included in the monograph, that possesses in vitro
activity against the micro-organisms listed in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii), as demonstrated by in vitro minimum inhibitory
concentration determinations conducted according to methodology established in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii). The
agency is proposing to include ``broad spectrum'' in the definitions of the three product classes included in this
tentative final monograph. (See section I.C, comment 6.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
6. The agency has reviewed the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other Allowable Statements 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
proposed in the previous tentative final monograph in &sect;333.85 for health-care personnel handwash, in &sect;333.87
for patient preoperative skin preparation, and in &sect;333.97 for surgical hand scrub and determined that statements
such as ``contains antibacterial ingredient(s),'' ``contains antimicrobial ingredient(s),'' and ``non-irritating,''
are not related in a significant way to the safe and effective use of these products and are not necessary on products
intended primarily for health-care professionals. Therefore, the agency is not including these statements in this
amended tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph. The statement ``recommended for repeated use,'' proposed for a health-care personnel handwash, has
been included as an ``other allowable indication'' in proposed &sect;333.455. The terms ``broad spectrum'' and
``fast acting'' are included in the definitions of all three product classes and the agency does not see the need to
include this information in the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling. (See section I.D., comment 7.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The agency is proposing revised indications for patient preoperative skin preparations in order to more precisely
describe the intended uses of these products. The previous indications ``kills micro-organisms,'' ``antibacterial,''
and ``antimicrobial'' are not being included. Likewise, the indications ``kills micro-organisms,'' ``bacteriostatic,''
and ``bactericidal'' previously proposed for surgical hand scrubs are not being included in this amended tentative
final monograph. The agency believes that these terms are product attributes and not indications for use and should
not be included as indications in the labeling of these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Based on the recommendations of the Miscellaneous External Panel in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking
for OTC alcohol drug products (47 FR 22324 at 22332), the agency is proposing ``for preparation of the skin prior to
an injection'' as an indication for OTC alcohol and isopropyl alcohol drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The agency is proposing in &sect;333.450(c) of this amended tentative final monograph the following general warning
statements for all health-care antiseptic drug products: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ``For external use only.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ``Do not use in the eyes.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) ``Discontinue use if irritation and redness develops. If condition persists for more than 72 hours consult a doctor.''
The agency is further proposing that the second sentence of the proposed warning in (3) above may be deleted for products
labeled ``For Hospital and Professional Use Only.'' (See section I.D., comment 8.) In addition to the general warnings
proposed for OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care antiseptic drug products, the agency is proposing the following warning for patient preoperative skin
preparations containing isopropyl alcohol identified in &sect;333.412(d): ``Do not use this product with electrocautery
procedures.'' The proposed warning is based on reports of burns associated with the use of isopropyl alcohol containing
patient preoperative skin preparations with electrocautery procedures. (See section II.A., paragraph 1_Summary
of Ingredient Categories.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Based on its review of the published literature (Refs. 1, 2, and 3), the agency has determined that the way in which
health-care antiseptic drug products are used, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 method of application, duration of scrub or wash, or use in conjunction with a device (such as a scrub brush), contributes
to the effectiveness of these drug products. Therefore, instead of proposing directions for use of these products
that include fixed scrub or wash durations or methods of application, the agency is proposing in &sect;&sect;333.455(c),
333.460(d), and 333.465(c) directions for use that reflect the conditions used when the antiseptic product was tested
according to &sect;333.470(b). In addition, based on data indicating that the largest bioburden of the hands lies
in the subungual region (Ref. 4), the agency is proposing that the directions for use of surgical hand scrub drug products
include the following instructions for the trimming and cleansing of the nails: ``Clean under nails with a nail pick.
Nails should be maintained with a 1 millimeter free edge.''

11. The agency is aware that some manufacturers provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical information relating to the antimicrobial activity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their health-care antiseptic drug products in the form of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical information bulletins. The agency considers such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bulletins to be labeling under the provisions of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 201(m) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(m)) defines the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``labeling'' as ``all labels and other written, printed, or graphic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter (1) upon any article or any of the containers or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article.'' As labeling, technical information bulletins are subject to the OTC
drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has no objection to the inclusion of technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information relating to the antimicrobial activity of these OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug products in the labeling of products intended for health-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care professionals only. Therefore, in this amended tentative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final monograph the agency is proposing that manufacturers have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the option of including data derived from the in vitro and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clinical effectiveness tests included in &sect;333.470 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed monograph as additional labeling for products labeled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and marketed ``For Hospital and Professional Use Only.'' In order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that such additional information provide a standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparison of the effectiveness of these OTC drug products, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is further proposing that only data on the antimicrobial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity of these OTC drug products derived from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness tests included in &sect;333.470 of this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph be included in the labeling of these OTC drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the present time, claims of product effectiveness against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organisms other than those included in &sect;333.470(a)(1)(ii) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require an NDA containing information supporting the deviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the monograph in accord with &sect;330.11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Based on the wound healing data from studies of test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wounds in laboratory animals that were discussed in the first aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic segment of this amended tentative final monograph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(comment 37, 56 FR 33644 at 33662), the agency has reevaluated the labeling for iodine tincture as a patient preoperative
skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation and is not including the warning ``Do not apply this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product with a tight bandage, as a burn may result.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The agency has determined that data and reports have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not provided specific evidence that repeated use of health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptics has brought about overgrowth of gram-negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteria, particularly 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pseudomonas.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, the previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed caution in &sect;333.99(a) concerning this overgrowth is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being included in this amended tentative final monograph. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section I.D, comment 9.) The warnings proposed in &sect;333.99 (b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (c) of the previous tentative final monograph are not being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in this amendment because these warnings apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quaternary ammonium compounds which currently are not Category I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for health-care antiseptic uses. (See section I.J., comment 20.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The agency is not including the warning proposed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Miscellaneous External Panel in &sect;333.98(c)(2) for products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing isopropyl alcohol, ``Use only in a well-ventilated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area; fumes may be toxic.'' As discussed in section II.B., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph 32 of the segment of this rulemaking covering first aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptics (56 FR 33644 at 33556), the agency invites comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the need for such a warning, including any reports of adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactions due to inhalation that have not yet been brought to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's attention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. In an effort to simplify OTC drug labeling, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in a number of tentative final monographs to substitute the word ``doctor'' for ``physician'' in OTC drug
monographs on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis that the word ``doctor'' is more commonly used and better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understood by consumers. Based on comments to these proposals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency has determined that final monographs and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable OTC drug regulations will give manufacturers the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option of using the word ``physician'' or the word ``doctor.'' This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended tentative final monograph proposes that option in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;333.450(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Based on the withdrawal of the majority of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on chlorhexidine gluconate as a health-care antiseptic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient data upon which to make a safety and effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination are no longer present in the rulemaking. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section I.F., comment 11.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. The agency has reviewed the data submitted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloroxylenol and is classifying chloroxylenol 0.24 percent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.75 percent as Category I for safety and Category III for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness for short-term use (patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation) and Category III for both safety and effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for long-term uses (antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwash and surgical hand scrub). (See section I.G., comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

18. In &sect;333.30(a) of the previous tentative final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monograph, the agency included United States Pharmacopeia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(U.S.P.) specifications for iodine tincture and topical solution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this amended tentative final monograph, the agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying these Category I patient preoperative products as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iodine tincture U.S.P. and iodine topical solution U.S.P. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
19. The agency has reviewed the submitted data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hexachlorophene and concludes that the data do not address the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety concerns expressed by the Antimicrobial I Panel on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredient. Therefore, the agency is proposing that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hexachlorophene remain available by prescription only. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section I.H., comment 13.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. The agency has evaluated a ``mixed iodophor'' consisting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of iodine complexed by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sorbitan monolaurate and found it to be safe for use as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgical hand scrub and health-care personnel handwash, but there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are insufficient data available to determine its effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these uses. Therefore, it is being classified in Category 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. (See section I.I., comment 15.) The other iodine-surfactant complexes classified by the Antimicrobial I Panel

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain in Category III for health-care uses due to a lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. The agency is including povidone-iodine 5 to 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent as a Category I health-care antiseptic ingredient for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin preparation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash. (See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section I.I., comment 17.) As discussed in section I.I., comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16, the agency is not including the warning about the interaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of iodophors and starch-containing compounds proposed in comment 66 of the previous tentative final monograph (43
FR 1221). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is also not including professional labeling to limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molecular weight of povidone-iodine or special warnings related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the molecular weight of povidone-iodine. (See section I.I., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment 18.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. The agency has evaluated the data submitted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzalkonium chloride and determined that the data are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to establish the efficacy of this ingredient as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient preoperative skin preparation. (See section I.J., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment 20.) No data were received on other health-care uses of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this ingredient or health-care uses of the two other quaternary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ammonium compounds (benzethonium chloride and methylbenzethonium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloride) classified by the Antimicrobial I Panel. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quaternary ammonium compounds remain in Category III as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care antiseptics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. The agency has reviewed data submitted on sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxychlorosene, an ingredient not previously classified for OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topical antiseptic use, and is placing this ingredient in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category III for both safety and effectiveness. (See section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I.K., comment 22.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. The agency has reclassified triclosan up to 1 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from Category II to Category III as a health-care antiseptic for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use as a patient preoperative skin preparation, antiseptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handwash or health-care personnel handwash, and surgical hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scrub. While submitted data indicate that triclosan_when properly formulated_may be effective, data that meet
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria described in section I.N., comment 28 are needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish effectiveness. In addition, based upon submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety data and other information, the agency has reclassified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ingredient from Category III to Category I for safety for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-term use as a patient preoperative skin preparation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Triclosan remains classified in Category III for long-term use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgical hand scrub). (See section I.L., comment 23.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. The agency is proposing a number of Category I health-care antiseptic ingredients in this document. All of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients included in this proposal as Category I health-care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antiseptic ingredients are standardized and characterized for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality and purity and are included as articles in the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States Pharmacopeia or National Formulary (U.S.P./N.F.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 1). However, a number of other ingredients being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered in this rulemaking, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 triclosan and triclocarban 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not listed in the U.S.P./N.F. For an active ingredient to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in an OTC drug final monograph, in addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information demonstrating safety and effectiveness, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to have publicly available sufficient chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information that can be used by all manufacturers to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the ingredient is appropriate for use in their products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that it would be appropriate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties interested in upgrading nonmonograph ingredients to monograph status to develop with the United States
Pharmacopeial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Convention appropriate standards for the quality and purity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care antiseptic ingredients that are not already included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in official compendia. However, should interested parties fail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide necessary information so that appropriate standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be established, ingredients otherwise eligible for monograph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status will not be included in the final monograph.

26. The agency is proposing testing requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient preoperative skin preparation, antiseptic handwash or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health-care personnel handwash, and surgical hand scrub drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products in &sect;333.470 of this tentative final monograph. As part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the effectiveness criteria for a patient preoperative skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, the agency is proposing new testing requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products labeled with the proposed indication ``for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation of the skin prior to an injection.'' (See section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
27. The agency acknowledges that deodorancy is considered a cosmetic claim. However, some deodorant soap products
also bear antimicrobial claims. The agency stated in comment 10 of the tentative final monograph for OTC first aid
antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644 at 33648) that deodorant soap products making antimicrobial claims are considered
to be drugs and that the testing guidelines for antimicrobial claims would be addressed in this rulemaking. Any deodorant
soap product containing a monograph ingredient may be labeled with antimicrobial claims provided the product meets
the testing requirements for health-care antiseptic drug products or surgical hand scrubs as described under proposed
&sect;333.470. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency stated in the previous tentative final monograph for topical antimicrobial drug products (43 FR 1210 at
1244) that actual claims of deodorancy should correlate the microbial reduction achieved in a modified Cade handwashing
test to an ``adequately designed and executed deodorancy test, such as controlled sniff test.'' Several comments
to that proposal objected to such a correlation of deodorancy and microbial reduction. However, none of the comments
provided satisfactory data to enable the agency to include any test in a monograph as a standard for deodorancy due
to antimicrobial activity. Specific testing for antimicrobial claims for deodorancy has not yet been developed.
The agency intends to review any comments or methods submitted for such a purpose in response to this publication and
invites comments and data on this topic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. The Panel's evaluation of OTC topical antimicrobial drug products did not include an evaluation of the use of these
products by the food industry as hand sanitizers or dips. Historically, hand sanitizers and dips have been marketed
as hand cleansers for use by food handlers in federally inspected meat and poultry processing plants and in food handling
establishments. Regulation of these products has been under the jurisdiction of the U. S. Department of Agriculture.
However, it has come to the agency's attention that many of these products include label claims that the agency considers
drug claims, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ``antibacterial handwash,'' ``kills germs and bacteria on contact,'' or ``effectively reduces bacterial flora
of the skin''. (See comment 10 of the tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644
at 33648).) Examination of the labeling of these products (Ref. 1) has led the agency to conclude that the intended
use of these products, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the reduction of micro-organisms on human skin for the purpose of the prevention of disease caused by contaminated
food, makes them drugs under the provisions of the act. Section 201(g)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)) defines
a ``drug'' as an article ``intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease
in man *&blank;*&blank;*.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety and effectiveness of active ingredients in these products for drug use needs to be demonstrated. Therefore,
the agency is including evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of topical antimicrobial active ingredients
indicated for use as hand sanitizers or dips in the rulemaking for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products. Accordingly,
the agency invites the submission of data, published or unpublished, and any other information pertinent to the use
of topical antimicrobial ingredients in hand sanitizers or dips. The agency also invites comment on applicable effectiveness
standards for these products. These data and information will facilitate the agency's review and aid in its determination
as to whether these OTC drug products for human use are safe, effective, and not misbranded under their recommended
conditions of use. This evaluation will provide all interested parties an opportunity to present for consideration
the best data and information available to support the stated claims for these products. The agency suggests that
all submissions be in the format described in 21 CFR 330.10(a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to be eligible for review under the OTC drug review procedures, the ingredient must have been marketed in a
hand sanitizer or dip to a material extent and for a material time (21 U.S.C. 321(p)(2)). The submission of data should
include information that demonstrates that the ingredient(s) has been marketed as a hand sanitizer or dip to a material
extent and for a material time. Products with ingredients under consideration in the OTC drug review may be marketed
(at the same dosage strength and in the same dosage form) under the manufacturer's good faith belief that the product
is generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded and in accord with FDA's enforcement policies related
to the OTC drug review. (See FDA's Compliance Policy Guides 7132b.15 and 7132b.16.) Such products are marketed at
the risk that the agency may adopt a position requiring relabeling, recall, or other regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that antimicrobial hand sanitizers/dips marketed for use in food handling/processing are typically
labeled for a variety of other antimicrobial uses that may include various animal ``drug'' uses and the disinfection
of inanimate objects. These other uses of hand sanitizer or dips will not be included in the agency's evaluation as
part of this rulemaking.

29. The agency is proposing to remove a portion of &sect;369.21 applicable to OTC health-care antiseptic drug products
when the final monograph eventually becomes effective because a portion of the regulations will be superseded by
the final monograph. The item proposed for removal is the entry for ``ALCOHOL RUBBING COMPOUND'' in &sect;369.21.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Analysis of Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of this proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act
(Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined
by the Executive Order and, thus, is not subject to review under the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. This proposed rule increases the number of ingredients tentatively classified
as generally recognized as safe and effective for use in OTC health-care antiseptic drug products from the previous
proposal and, if finalized as proposed, would reduce the need for further safety and effectiveness testing for a number
of health-care antiseptic drug products. The detailed testing procedures included in the proposed rule should assist
manufacturers of products containing ingredients not included in the proposed monograph, due to a lack of demonstrated
effectiveness, in performing the tests that would demonstrate effectiveness so the ingredients can be included
in the final rule. The testing procedures will also provide manufacturers guidance on testing requirements for regulatory
compliance. Products that contain ingredients for which safety and effectiveness are not established will require
reformulation. The proposed monograph includes ingredients that may be used if reformulation becomes necessary.
All products will need some relabeling. One year will be provided from the date of publication of the final rule for
any necessary relabeling or reformulation. Accordingly, the agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, no further analysis is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency invites public comment regarding any substantial or significant economic impact that this rulemaking
would have on OTC health-care antiseptic drug products. Types of impact may include, but are not limited to, costs
associated with product testing, relabeling, repackaging, or reformulation. Comments regarding the impact of
this rulemaking on OTC health-care antiseptic drug products should be accompanied by appropriate documentation.
Because the agency has not previously invited specific comment on the economic impact of the OTC drug review on health-care
antiseptic drug products, a period of 180 days from the date of publication of this proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will be provided for comments on this subject to be developed and submitted. The agency will evaluate any comments
and supporting data that are received and will reassess the economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the
final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before December 14, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch, written comments,
objections, or requests for oral hearing before the Commissioner on the proposed regulation. A request for an oral
hearing must specify points to be covered and time requested. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination
may be submitted on or before December 14, 1994. Three copies of all comments, objections, and requests are to be submitted,
except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments, objections, and requests are to be identified with the docket
number found in brackets in the heading of this document and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief.
Comments, objections, and requests may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Any scheduled oral hearing will be announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons, on or before June 19, 1995, may also submit in writing new data demonstrating the safety and effectiveness
of those conditions not classified in Category I. Written comments on the new data may be submitted on or before August
17, 1995. These dates are consistent with the time periods specified in the agency's final rule revising the procedural
regulations for reviewing and classifying OTC drugs, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47730). Three copies of all data and comments on the data are to be submitted, except that
individuals may submit one copy, and all data and comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets
in the heading of this document. Data and comments should be addressed to the Dockets Management Branch. Received
data and comments may also be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In establishing a final monograph, the agency will ordinarily consider only data submitted prior to the closing of
the administrative record on August 17, 1995. Data submitted after the closing of the administrative record will
be reviewed by the agency only after a final monograph is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, unless the Commissioner finds good cause has been shown that warrants earlier consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agency is proposing to amend 21 CFR part 333 by adding new subpart E, consisting of &sect;&sect;333.401
through 333.470, and to amend 21 CFR part 369 by amending &sect;369.21 in order to establish conditions under which
OTC health-care antiseptic drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded.

(iii) Determine the possible development of resistance to the chemical. Two approaches to determining the emergence
of resistance to a particular antimicrobial are to be used. The first approach involves a determination of the evolution
of a point mutation by the sequential passage of an organism through increasing concentrations of the antimicrobial
included in the culture medium. The second approach is a thorough survey of the published literature to determine
whether resistance has been reported for the antimicrobial ingredient. The survey is to include information on the
microbial contamination of marketed products containing the antimicrobial ingredient in question irrespective
of drug concentration. The survey is to cover all countries in which products containing the active ingredient are
marketed. Any information submitted in a foreign language should include a translation. Alternate approaches to
determining the development of resistance can be submitted as a petition in accord with &sect;10.30 of this chapter.
The petition is to contain sufficient data to show that the alternate approach provides a reliable indication of the
development of resistance to a particular antimicrobial ingredient.

Time-kill studies. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) The assessment of the in vitro spectrum of the antimicrobial provides information on the types of genera and species
that may be considered susceptible under the conditions of the test procedure described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)
of this section. However, information is also required that allows an assessment of how rapidly the antimicrobial
product produces its effect. Such information may be derived from in vitro time-kill curve studies using a selected
battery of organisms and a specified drug concentration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) The satisfactory performance of the test product as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed by the results of the MIC studies, the time-kill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies, and the simulated in vivo clinical trials of organisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representing the resident microbial flora can then be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assess the effectiveness of the test product for the transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbial flora most commonly encountered in the clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
setting. This procedure is required because methods, other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the health-care personnel hand test, do not exist for assessing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the in vivo effectiveness of test products versus the transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbial flora. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) It is recognized that a generally accepted or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardized method that may be used in conducting in vitro time-kill studies is not available, but the agency encourages
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission of proposed methods that may be considered applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this test. Many variables that should be considered in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of a method have been addressed for antibiotics and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are also applicable to these products. Such variables are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described by Schoenknecht, F. D., L. D. Sabath, and C.

``Manual of Clinical Microbiology'' cited in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a)(1)(iv)(C) of this section with the following modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the time frames of greatest interest for antiseptic drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products intended for health-care personnel handwash, surgical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand scrub, and patient preoperative skin preparation use are 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 30 minutes, the time-kill studies are to focus on these time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frames and are to include enumerations at times 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15, 20, and 30 minutes. Enumerate the bacteria in the sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solution by a standard plate count procedure such as that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in ``Standard Methods for the Evaluation of Dairy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Products'' (available from American Public Health Association, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inc., 1015 15th St. NW., Washington, DC 20005), but using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soybean-casein digest agar and a suitable inactivator for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
antimicrobial where necessary. The suitability of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inactivator is to be demonstrated using a procedure such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in E 1054, ``Test Methods for Evaluating Inactivators of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. The

battery of organisms selected is to represent the resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbial flora most commonly encountered under actual use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions of the test product and the transient microbial flora 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most likely to be encountered by health-care professionals in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clinical settings. Therefore, the micro-organisms to be used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these time-kill studies are to be the standard ATCC strains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. The drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration to be tested should be a tenfold dilution of the

) A definitive recommendation regarding the inclusion

of an inactivator prior to the final wash cannot be made. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions of whether residual neutralizer on the skin will reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effectiveness of the test formulation in subsequent washes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and result in higher than expected bacterial counts and whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or not samples can be processed rapidly enough to avoid a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decreased bacterial count due to the continued action of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation should be considered when the decision concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of a neutralizer in sampling solutions used for bacterial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection prior to the final wash is made. Whatever the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision, to facilitate the comparison of results across studies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the investigator is to indicate whether or not a neutralizer has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been included.

wash with baseline control soap. Subjects are not to have washed

D is the clinical difference of significance to be ruled

out; say 20 percent of the active control's mean reduction from

baseline at a specific time. For example, data from a number of glove juice studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted over the past few years to the agency as part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications under part 314 of this chapter were reviewed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain information relative to the variance of the difference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from baseline for count reduction data. For 128 standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviations extracted, it was noted that 50 percent of the values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are between .90 and 1.12; 25 percent are less than .90; and 25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent are greater than 1.12. The range is from .49 to 1.73, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 25th percentile standard deviation is 0.86, the median 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard deviation is 1.01, and the 75th percentile standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation is 1.20. The larger the standard deviation, the larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sample size required to rule out a difference of clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance. Assuming that the active control surgical hand scrub 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produces a mean log reduction of 2.5 at hour 3 and the test hand

scrub is to be within 20 percent of this,

design is to be used to test the products. Due to the nature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their constituents, some test surgical hand scrubs will require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not only the use of an active control arm but also use of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle control arm and perhaps a placebo control arm to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate efficacy. The schematic layout of sampling

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No sooner than 12 hours, nor longer than 4 days after completion of their baseline determination, subjects perform
the initial scrub with the test formulations. Determine the bacterial population on the randomly designated hand
of all subjects assigned to hour 1/60 in Table 2 of paragraph (b)(iii)(G) of this section immediately (within 1 minute)
after scrub with the appropriate scrub formulation. Determine the bacterial counts on the designated hands at 3 and
6 hours after scrub. Determine bacterial population by sampling hands and enumerating the bacteria in the sampling
solution as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii)(K) and (b)(1)(iii)(L) of this section. Repeat this scrubbing and
sampling procedure the next day (day 2). On day 5, repeat the sampling procedure after scrubbing with the formulations
two additional times on day 2 and three times per day on day 3 and day 4, with at least a 1-hour interval between scrubs.
Perform one scrub on day 5, prior to sampling. In summary, the subjects scrub a total of 11 times with each formulation,
once on days 1 and 5 and 3 times per day on days 2, 3, and 4. Collect bacterial samples following the single scrubs of days
1 and 5 and following the first scrub on day 2. This procedure mimics typical usage and permits determination of both
immediate and longer-term reductions.

) Treat data as a binomial response. That is, if a subject achieves the target reduction, it is judged a success; if not,
it is a failure. A potential problem to this approach is that information may be lost. For example, if at the 1 minute
time frame, a large number of subjects using one skin scrub achieve a 2-log reduction and those on the other scrub attain
only a 1-log reduction, the binomial procedure will indicate both scrubs achieve the same degree of reduction. If
it is believed that the binomial approach causes loss of information by not including numerical response data, then
the alternate statistical analysis described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(0)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of this section is applicable. If the success rate is in the 90 percent range, then the variance is relatively small,
sample size requirements are relatively small, and confidence intervals are reasonable. However, if the success
rates drop to the 70 percent range, then relatively large sample sizes are required to obtain the same power as one gets
for 90 percent success rates.

) Another option is to treat the log counts as numerical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data and evaluate using the Student's t-test or similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure. The large variance that usually occurs with this type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

homogeneous and the large variance problem is alleviated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the variances are large, the sample size must be increased

considerably to retain the same level of the test, same power,

Wash and rinse procedure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The wash and rinse procedure described as follows is for all washes with the test formulation. A specified volume of
the test formulation is dispensed onto the hands and rubbed over all surfaces, taking caution not to lose or dilute
the substance. After the material is spread, a small amount of water is added from the tap and the hands are completely
lathered for a specified time period. The lower third of the forearm is also washed. After completion of the wash, hands
and forearms are rinsed under tap water at 40

&cir;C for 30 seconds. A total of 10 washes with the test formulation is involved. Bacterial samples are taken following
the 1st, 3rd, 7th, and 10th washes.

Bacterial sampling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the 1st, 3rd, 7th, and 10th washes, place rubber gloves or polyethylene bags used for sampling on the right and
left hand. Sampling should occur within 5 minutes after each of these washes. Add 50 to 100 milliliters of sampling
solution to each glove and secure gloves above the wrist. After adding sampling solution, uniformly massage all surfaces
of the hand for 1 minute, paying particular attention to the area under the nails. After massaging aseptically, sample
the fluid of the glove. Transfer immediately a measured volume of the sampling fluid to a test tube containing a suitable
antimicrobial inactivator.

(

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Because contamination, product use, and enumeration are conducted sequentially within a time period of less than
a day, an inactivator included in the sampling solution prior to the final wash may affect the test results. Therefore,
no inactivator for the antimicrobial in the handwash formulation is to be included in the sampling solution prior
to the final wash. The 50 to 100 milliliters of sampling fluid may be sufficient to dilute out the activity of the antimicrobial;
however, this should be demonstrated using a procedure such as the one described in E 1054, ``Test Methods for Evaluation
Inactivators of Antimicrobial Agents Used in Disinfectants, Sanitizer, and Antiseptic Products,'' in ``Annual
Book of ASTM Standards,'' vol. 11.04, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR

) In order to validate the testing procedure, equipment, and facilities, it is required that the test formulation
be compared with an active control formulation. This will require an equivalent number of panelists to be assigned
to the control formulation on a random basis. All test parameters will be equivalent for both formulations, although
the handwash procedure for the established formulation may be different from that of the test formulation. Both test
and control formulations are to be run concurrently. The identity of the formulations used by panelists is to be blinded
from those individuals counting plates and analyzing data.

Because the hands are inoculated prior to sampling it is possible to generate counts of 1.5x105 to 106 organisms. Therefore,
reductions are less variable and evaluation of the log counts using the Student's t- test or similar procedure is recommended.

Subjects admitted to

portion or abdomen portion of the study, or both. Once a subject

to one contralateral groin site, for subjects identified as

 (

1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Two ways to statistically evaluate effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a preoperative scrub product are presented. The first depends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon calculating the average log
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction from baseline. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is accomplished by obtaining the difference in log counts for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each paired sample for each subject in the appropriate sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time frame. This will facilitate subsequent statistical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of resulting data. It is usually fairly easy to enroll 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjects with counts 1&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or greater when working with the groin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas. It is anticipated this method will primarily be used to evaluate data collected from the groin areas. The sample
size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimation equation given earlier may be used to estimate sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sizes required for this case. Standard deviations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preoperative scrub products are relatively homogeneous when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion criterion require counts of 1&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or greater. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard deviations extracted from files range from 0.82 to 1.72; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the median standard deviation was 0.98. When counts in the range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1&times;10

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 were used, the standard deviation ranged from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.78 to 1.22, with a median value of 0.99. Using the sample size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimation equation given in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(F) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section and assuming the active control preoperative scrub 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produces an immediate mean log reduction of 2.0 and test scrub is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be within 20 percent of this, i.e., D=0.4, and S
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
=0.98, gives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
n=97 subjects per arm of the study. Because blocks of 6 are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended, the sample size per treatment arm is 96 subjects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The second method for evaluating the data depends upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing an entry target bacterial population of greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250 colony forming units per square centimeter and a target 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction criterion that a successful scrub reduces bacterial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counts to below 25 colony forming units per square centimeter. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful scrub product is to provide this degree of reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in at least 90 percent of the subjects tested. Using the normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
binomial confidence interval approach, it can be shown that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standard preoperative scrub product achieves a 90 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
success rate and it is desired to rule out success rates less than 85 percent for the new product with power of 80 percent
then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
340 subjects per arm are required. If it is desired to rule out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
success rates less than 80 percent, then the sample size is only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 per arm. Again, since blocks of 6 or some multiple thereof, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are recommended, the sample size is 102 subjects per study arm.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, all raw data should be converted to common (base 10) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logarithms. Reduction should be calculated from the average of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the logarithms. This will also facilitate statistical analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of data.

) In order to validate the testing procedure, equipment, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, it is required that the test material be compared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an active control material. The number of test subjects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will depend upon the number of control posttreatment sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervals chosen and the level of statistical significance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desired for the test results. The identity of the formulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used by panelists should be blinded from those individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counting plates and analyzing data.

(2) To validate the assay, compare, at each sampling

Effects on microbial flora.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The agency notes that, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is some reasonable scientific indication that the activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an ingredient will affect the microbial flora, and thereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause a shift in the composition of this flora, e.g., an increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the fungus or virus level that might result in greater harm, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then further safety and effectiveness testing will be required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The formulation or mode of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of certain products may require modifications of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the testing procedures in this section. In addition, alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assay methods (including automated procedures) employing the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basic chemistry and microbiology as the methods included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section may be used. Any proposed modification or alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assay method shall be submitted as a petition under the rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established in &sect;10.30 of this chapter. The petition should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain data to support the modification or data demonstrating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an alternative assay method provides results of equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy. All information submitted will be subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure rules in part 20 of this chapter.
