SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are proposing to amend the Mexican fruit fly regulations by adding a high-temperature forced air treatment for
grapefruit. This proposed action would provide an alternative treatment for grapefruit that require treatment
to be moved interstate from regulated areas in Texas and California. Adding this treatment would facilitate the interstate
movement of grapefruit grown in regulated areas.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Mexican fruit fly, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Anastrepha ludens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Loew), is a destructive pest of citrus and other types of fruit. The short life cycle of the Mexican fruit fly allows
rapid development of serious outbreaks that can cause severe economic losses in commercial citrus-producing areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to prevent the artificial spread of the Mexican fruit fly to noninfested areas, the regulations in 7 CFR 301.64
(referred to below as the regulations) restrict the interstate movement of regulated articles from regulated areas
in quarantined States. Quarantined States are listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;301.64(a), regulated articles are listed in &sect;301.64&hyph;2, and regulated areas are listed in &sect;301.64&hyph;3(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A regulated article may be moved interstate from a regulated area in a quarantined State into or through American Samoa,
Arizona, California, Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Louisiana, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, Texas, or the
U.S. Virgin Islands only if the movement is in accordance with the conditions prescribed in the regulations. Under
&sect;301.64&hyph;4 of the regulations, a regulated article may be moved interstate from a regulated area in a quarantined
State into or through those areas only if it is accompanied by a certificate or limited permit issued in accordance
with &sect;301.64&hyph;5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations in &sect;301.64&hyph;5 state, in part, that a certificate may be issued for the interstate movement
of a regulated article if an inspector determines that the regulated article is free from the Mexican fruit fly, or
that the premises of origin is free from the Mexican fruit fly and the regulated article has not been exposed to the pest.
Regulated articles are most often certified for interstate movement in one of these ways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, there are cases where a regulated article or its premises of origin cannot be determined to be free from the
Mexican fruit fly. In such cases, a certificate will be issued if the regulated article is treated in accordance with
&sect;301.64&hyph;10, or a limited permit may be obtained to move the regulated article interstate to receive one
of the treatments specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;301.64&hyph;10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the regulations provide cold treatment and methyl bromide fumigation as treatments for grapefruit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Citrus paradisi)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, one of the regulated articles listed in &sect;301.64&hyph;2. We are proposing to add a high-temperature forced
air treatment to &sect;301.64&hyph;10 as an optional treatment for grapefruit. This high-temperature forced air
treatment was developed by the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture as an effective
alternative treatment against the Mexican fruit fly in grapefruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The treatment is administered in a sealed, insulated chamber on grapefruit that are at least 3.5 inches (9 centimeters)
in diameter, weigh at least 9.25 ounces (262 grams), and have an initial pulp temperature of at least 77 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (25 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C). The air in the chamber is then heated as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To 104 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 120 minutes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To 122 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 90 minutes; then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To 126 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (52 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), where the temperature is maintained until the grapefruit center reaches 118 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (48 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The air may be heated in the chamber, or hot air may be introduced into the chamber. The treatment schedule includes
a warning that grapefruit larger than 3.7 inches (9.5 centimeters) in diameter and 14.2 ounces (402 grams) in weight
may suffer cosmetic damage as a result of this treatment because of the longer times needed to reach the required temperatures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adding this treatment would facilitate the interstate movement of grapefruit grown in regulated areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget
has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule, if adopted, would amend the regulations by adding a high-temperature forced air treatment to
the list of approved treatments for Mexican fruit fly in grapefruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 1,500 citrus grove owners and 50 shippers who would benefit by having an additional treatment
option for grapefruit to be moved interstate from a regulated area. It appears unlikely that adding another treatment
would increase the amount of grapefruit moved from regulated areas in Texas and California because most citrus and
other regulated articles moved interstate by owners and shippers qualify for movement without requiring treatment.
Treatment becomes necessary only when the regulated articles or their premises of origin cannot be certified as being
free from Mexican fruit fly.

Cold treatment and methyl bromide fumigation are the two treatments currently available for grapefruit. The availability
of the high-temperature forced air treatment would simply provide another treatment option when treatment is required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by order of the FCA Board (Board), reproposes a rule amending its regulations
governing the referral of known or suspected criminal violations. The proposed regulation was originally published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 13, 1992 (57 FR 46819). The objective of this reproposed regulation is, in part, to promote efficiencies
and timeliness in reporting, investigating, and prosecuting known or suspected criminal activities within Farm
Credit System (FCS or System) institutions. Therefore, this reproposed regulation would require System institutions
to notify law enforcement agencies of known or suspected criminal violations that meet the threshold reporting limits.
Generally, a criminal violation must be reported under this part if the borrower/shareholder or insider has an intent
to ``defraud'' a System institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reproposed regulation would also mandate the continued use of the existing criminal Referral Form. System institutions
should expect this form to be replaced with a new FCA Criminal Referral Form in the future. The existing criminal Referral
Form or any replacement form is referred to hereinafter as Referral Form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA believes that the regulation should be reproposed due to the lapse of time since the proposed rule was originally
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (October 13, 1992). Although the reproposed rule incorporates many of the comments received in response to the proposed
rule, the FCA Board also believes that the public should be given another opportunity to comment due to the number of
changes proposed and the level of interest in the issues. To the extent that commenters wish to comment on the dollar
thresholds for reporting known or suspected criminal activities or an institution's cost of complying with the regulation,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulation was published (57 FR 46819) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 13, 1992. The comment period for the proposed regulation amending part 617 closed on November 12, 1992.
The FCA received two letters on the proposed regulation. The Farm Credit Council (Council), on behalf of its membership,
provided comments and suggestions on the wording and requirements of the proposed regulation. The FCA also received
a letter from the Farm Credit Bank of Baltimore adopting the Council's comments. Many of the commenters' suggestions
were incorporated to improve clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council requested, among other things, that the FCA Board republish the proposed regulation. The FCA Board agrees
that the proposed regulation should be republished to afford the public another opportunity to comment. All comments
submitted to date have been considered and responded to concerning the proposed regulation. Responses to these comments
are detailed below, and corresponding changes were made to the proposed regulation in many instances. The commenters
also addressed whether the dollar thresholds for reporting known or suspected criminal activities should be increased.
One of the stated reasons to raise the thresholds was to limit the perceived reporting burden that would result from
implementation of the proposed thresholds. It was believed that if the reporting thresholds were increased, the
reporting burden would decrease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those commenters who wish to comment again on the dollar thresholds are requested to provide any pertinent empirical
information that would indicate that the thresholds should be increased. Commenters who address the cost of complying
with the proposed regulation, e.g., time and cost of investigating and completing the Referral Form under existing
thresholds in part 617 and the proposed thresholds, should also provide pertinent empirical information in support
of their comments.

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended, the FCA regulates and examines FCS institutions for safety and
soundness and for compliance with Federal laws and regulations. Violations of Federal laws and regulations may affect
the safety and soundness of FCS institutions and could undermine public confidence in the FCS. System institutions
have the responsibility to establish and maintain safeguards to detect, deter, and report criminal activity involving
the assets, operations, or affairs of the institution. Law enforcement agencies need to receive timely and specific
information from FCS institutions on known or suspected criminal violations to determine whether investigations
and prosecutions are warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Interagency Bank Fraud Working Group (Working Group), a task force consisting of the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
the Office of Thrift Supervision, the National Credit Union Administration, the Farm Credit Administration, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Secret Service, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Department of the
Treasury, was formed to facilitate the reporting of criminal activity by financial institutions and to enhance the
law enforcement agencies' ability to investigate and prosecute the matters reported. To accomplish these objectives,
the Working Group developed uniform reporting standards and processes for filing criminal referrals and is in the
process of developing a uniform criminal referral form.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the proposed regulation and consistent with the Working Group's recommendations, FCS institutions
would be required to make a criminal referral and file a Referral Form when a criminal violation of the United States
Code involving the institution's assets, operations, or affairs appears to have occurred and one of the circumstances
listed in &sect;617.2(a) exists. However, the proposed regulation should not be construed as reducing in any way
an institution's responsibility to otherwise report criminal activities when these circumstances do not exist.
The referrals would be made to the appropriate investigatory and/or prosecuting authorities, whether Federal,
State, or local. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Originally, the FCA proposed the use of a uniform criminal Referral Form which was designed by the Working Group. A
uniform criminal Referral Form was expected to aid law enforcement agencies in determining whether investigations
and/or prosecutions are warranted by standardizing requests for information and documentation. The FCA planned
to incorporate this form's standards and procedures in its own criminal Referral Form. When first published, the
proposed regulation indicated that the Referral Form, with instructions explaining how to complete, file, and distribute
the form to the appropriate investigatory agency, would be obtained from the FCA's Office of General Counsel (OGC)
or from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FCA Examination Manual
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Due to unforeseen circumstances affecting all the Federal financial regulatory agencies, the Working Group has
not yet promulgated a uniform criminal referral form. Consequently, the new Referral Form has not been developed.
As now contemplated under the proposed rule, System institutions would continue to use the existing criminal Referral
Forms found in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FCA Examination Manual
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, System institutions should expect the distribution of the new Referral Form after the Working Group completes
the standardized uniform criminal referral form.

III. Analysis of Changes and Comments by Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Section 617.1_Purpose and Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council noted that the proposed regulations did not include a sample of the Referral Form and, as a result, it could
not determine whether System banks would maintain any role in the criminal referral process. As previously stated,
the FCA did not publish the Referral Form with the proposed regulation because the uniform criminal referral form,
which the FCA intends to incorporate, had not, and has not yet, been promulgated by the Working Group. The existing
Referral Form, which may be obtained from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FCA Examination Manual
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, does not create any substantive requirements, nor will the new Referral Form. The Referral Form merely serves as
a vehicle for ensuring that System institutions report the information necessary to make a criminal referral. The
new Referral Form is not expected to require System institutions to submit any more information than they previously
have been required to submit using the existing Referral Form. For these reasons, the FCA believes even if the new Referral
Form were available at this time, its publication would not be necessary. If the uniform criminal referral form ultimately
promulgated by the Working Group creates new and previously-unanticipated requirements, the FCA will reconsider
whether to incorporate it in its entirety into the System's Referral Form.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council questioned whether or not the proposed regulation adequately addressed ``borrower transgressions.''
The FCA believes that the proposed regulation provides for the referral of all known or suspected violations of Federal
criminal laws, including both insider and borrower transgressions. In &sect;617.2(a) (2) and (3), the proposed
regulation specifically addresses borrower transgressions and would require a criminal referral when known or
suspected criminal activity occurs if certain circumstances are met. Section 617.2(a)(2) applies when the suspect
is not an employee, officer, director, agent, or other person participating in the affairs of an institution, i.e.,
a borrower. Section 617.2(a)(3) applies when there is no substantial basis for identifying a suspect, which may include
a borrower. Therefore, no amendment is believed to be necessary. For instance, a referral would be required when known
or suspected criminal activity involving actual or potential losses of $1,000 or more occurs and the institution
has a substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects as a borrower(s). A referral would
also be required when known or suspected criminal activity involving actual or potential losses of $5,000 or more
occurs and the institution has no substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects. In this
latter instance, the possible suspect or group of suspects could be a borrower(s). Also, &sect;617.2(a)(1) addresses
insider transgressions and would require a criminal referral, regardless of the amount of an actual or potential
loss, where an institution employee, officer, director, agent, or other person participating in the affairs of the
institution is suspected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council was concerned that the dollar thresholds for reporting known or suspected criminal activities as described
in &sect;617.2(a)(2) and (3) were too low. It also stated that the respective $1,000 and $5,000 thresholds would result
in reporting known or suspected criminal activities that law enforcement agencies would not prosecute, and that
the thresholds were a radical departure from prior practice. The Council also commented that some district banks
have been advised by U.S. Attorneys that criminal activities involving collateral conversion or misrepresentation
of financial information are not prosecuted when the diversion or misrepresentation is less than $25,000 to $50,000
or if the institution does not incur an actual loss. As a result, the Council believes that the thresholds should be
increased to higher levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group, which included the FCA, established the same thresholds for all Federal financial regulatory
agencies. The Working Group believes that uniform thresholds will enhance the ability of the Federal financial regulatory
agencies and the law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate, and prosecute known or suspected criminal activities.
The Working Group also believes that the lower thresholds are necessary to ensure the reporting of potential multiple
criminal violations by one individual at several different institutions. The Department of Justice, as a member
of the Working Group and oversight agency for the Offices of the U.S. Attorneys, assisted in the establishment of the
thresholds. Therefore, as a participant in the Working Group and in concurrence with the Department of Justice's
judgment on this matter, the FCA continues to support the Working Group and proposes the regulation with these thresholds.
The FCA will reconsider this issue should the Working Group modify the threshold levels in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note, however, that only a known or suspected criminal violation (meeting the dollar threshold
requirements of &sect;617.2(a)) must be reported. Generally, a criminal violation that must be reported under this
part involves a determination that a borrower or insider intended to ``defraud'' an institution in violation of a
Federal criminal statute. Institutions, therefore, must make an initial determination of whether a misrepresentation
of assets or a collateral conversion, for example, was done inadvertently or with the intent to defraud the institution.
Accordingly, in ascertaining whether a criminal referral is appropriate, an institution should consider all facts
and circumstances, including evidence of intent, to determine whether there is a known or suspected criminal violation.
If the institution is persuaded that there is no evidence of intent and, hence, no criminal violation, then it need
not make a criminal referral. Thus, System institutions are vested with considerable discretion. Should they feel
the need for guidance in exercising this responsibility, they may consult legal counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to expressed concerns about the referral threshold, the FCA reviewed the Systemwide criminal referrals for calendar
years 1992 and 1993. In 1992, there were 47 criminal referrals, of which 30 reported no dollar loss or an unknown dollar
loss. In 1993, there were 53 criminal referrals of which 30 reported no dollar loss or an unknown dollar loss. In addition,
the FCA received 7 criminal referrals in 1992 and 17 criminal referrals in 1993 reporting dollar losses over $50,000.
Of the criminal referrals received, there was a total of four insider transgressions in 1992 and 1993. It appears from
these statistics that System institutions may already be reporting criminal referrals consistent with the proposed
thresholds and that the thresholds are not a radical departure from current practices. Accordingly, the FCA proposed
regulation contains the same thresholds as originally contemplated. Commenters who continue to have concerns that
the thresholds are too low are requested to provide empirical data indicating to what extent the thresholds would
result in a departure from their current reporting practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council remarked that the proposed regulation did not adequately define ``potential'' loss. In further explanation
of the proposed regulation, it should be noted that the regulation (and Federal law) does not require that an institution
sustain an actual loss; the potential for a loss satisfies the regulation (and Federal criminal law). Furthermore,
the proposed regulation specifically states that the loss or potential loss is to be determined before reimbursement
or recovery. In other words, whether or not the loan is adequately collateralized has no bearing on the determination
of whether there is a loss or potential loss. For example, if a borrower with a loan that appears to be adequately collateralized
converts $10,000 of secured property or makes a false statement by omitting a $10,000 liability from a financial statement,
the institution would be required to report this known or suspected criminal violation to the appropriate authorities.
This is necessary because the institution has a potential loss of $10,000 before it receives actual payment on the
loan or recovers on the secured property. Although the loan may appear to be adequately collateralized notwithstanding
the conversion of $10,000, the institution nonetheless has a potential loss before reimbursement or recovery. The
loss need not actually have occurred for a reportable violation to exist. The FCA believes the foregoing explanation
should adequately address the potential loss concept. It is further noted that, in attempting to clarify this section,
the language of &sect;617.2(a)(2) and (3) has been amended to clarify that a situation involving a potential loss
could arise through the use of a false statement or other fraudulent means. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council further commented that the proposed regulation did not adequately address criminal acts that do not specifically
require a monetary loss, e.g., false statements under 18 U.S.C. 1014. As discussed above, such a criminal act has a
potential for monetary loss and should be reported in all situations where the threshold is met and it is reasonable
to believe that a criminal act occurred. The proposed regulation has been amended to clarify that a referral would
be required when there is a false statement that meets the threshold amounts.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council expressed concern that the standard for reporting noninsider transgressions was vague and difficult
to apply. The Council noted that determining when a substantial basis exists for identifying a suspect can be complex
and raises questions as to whether criminal intent can be inferred. The Council suggested that this determination
should be vested in System general counsels or their attorney designees. The FCA expects that, in reporting noninsider
transgressions, an institution will often be able to use its own judgment in determining whether it appears that a
criminal violation has occurred. In complex cases, however, institutions should continue to feel free to obtain
advice, legal or otherwise, as necessary. A System association may always consult with its affiliated district bank
during consideration of all the facts and circumstances to determine whether it is more probable than not that a criminal
activity occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council also commented that an institution should have discretion on whether to report known or suspected criminal
activities of State criminal laws to State law enforcement authorities. In response to this comment, the proposed
regulation was amended to provide that nothing in this part shall be construed as reducing, in any way, an institution's
general responsibility to report criminal activities to the appropriate investigatory and/or law enforcement
agencies, whether Federal, State or local. Therefore, institutions would have to be cognizant of, and take the necessary
steps to comply with, State reporting requirements. The appropriate law enforcement agency would then decide whether
or not such acts constitute a violation of a criminal statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council was concerned that the proposed regulation did not identify whether a Farm Credit Bank (FCB) or a Federal
land bank association (FLBA) would report known or suspected criminal activities when the FLBA services the loans
of the FCB. Due to this concern, the FCA amended &sect;617.2(a) to clarify that an FCB would have the responsibility
to refer known or suspected criminal activities identified by the servicing FLBA to the appropriate law enforcement
agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council commented that the proposed criminal referral regulation appears to make the criminal referral process
burdensome because the institution lacks the discretion not to refer known or suspected criminal violations above
the threshold amounts. At this time, it appears that any additional burden would be slight and offset by the regulation's
benefits, such as the promotion of efficiency and timeliness in reporting, investigating, and prosecuting known
or suspected criminal activities. Also, the regulation would standardize the reporting process and ensure that
all individuals, including borrowers, employees, officers and directors, are treated equally. It is believed that
the proposed regulation, which conforms to those proposed and final regulations of other financial regulatory agencies,
would improve the law enforcement agencies' response to System institutions' reports of criminal activities. However,
commenters may want to provide empirical information on the cost of compliance, as requested above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council questioned the institution's role or ability to make a recommendation concerning prosecution. The Council
suggested that reporting ``minor'' violations could hamper System relationships with the U.S. Attorney as well
as with its customers. While the regulation establishes threshold referral levels, an institution is free, nonetheless,
to express its view on whether prosecution does or does not appear to be warranted to the Federal authorities, including
a U.S. Attorney or other investigatory agency. A well-reasoned recommendation against prosecution in appropriate
cases should go far toward addressing the Council's concern without undermining the uniformity that the referral
requirements seek to promote. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council commented that the 14-day period to report criminal activity was insufficient to investigate, document,
review, and submit referral information. On further reflection, the FCA agrees. To ensure thorough documentation
and reporting by System institutions, the FCA has amended the proposed regulation, increasing the reporting period
to 30 calendar days from the date of discovery of the known or suspected criminal violation. Nonetheless, System institutions
would be encouraged to submit a criminal referral report as soon as possible following the discovery of a reportable
known or suspected criminal activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council commented that it was uncertain as to when the period for reporting a criminal referral begins. Upon further
consideration, the proposed regulation was amended to address this concern. The reporting period would begin when
management has discovered that there is a known or suspected criminal activity. In the alternative, the reporting
period would begin when management should have discovered that there was a known or suspected criminal activity.
This amendment is believed to be appropriate because management must ensure the institution's safety and soundness
and should be diligent in the exercise of their attendant duties, e.g., the timely identification and reporting of
known or suspected criminal activity, and in the adequate investigation and documentation of such criminal activity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council commented that &sect;617.2(c) (now &sect;617.2(b)) should define ``management'' as senior management
of the institution or the institution's criminal conduct officer/coordinator. The proposed regulation would require
that management make the criminal referral. The board of directors of a System institution, which is responsible
for the safe and sound operations of that institution, should establish appropriate policies and internal controls
for management to comply with these regulations. However, the board would have the discretion to implement the regulation
in a manner suited to its institution and could require senior management or the criminal conduct officer/coordinator
to make the criminal referral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council suggested eliminating &sect;617.2(d), which requires prompt notification, by telephone or other expeditious
means, to the appropriate law enforcement agency of situations requiring immediate attention or of ongoing reportable
violations. In coordination with other Federal financial regulatory agencies, the FCA included this section to
provide for circumstances in which direct telephone or other expeditious communications with the appropriate law
enforcement agency would be necessary or appropriate, even though an institution would have begun the referral process
required by &sect;617.2(a). While a 30-day notification period may be adequate in many situations, immediate notification
would be considered essential when the safety and soundness of an institution may be threatened by potential fraud,
losses, or an ongoing criminal activity, when there is a likelihood a suspect will flee, or when key institution personnel
are involved. For the foregoing reasons, it does not appear that this section would impose any unnecessary burden
on System institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Section 617.3_Notification of Board of Directors and Bonding Company 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council commented that the regulatory reporting requirement concerning criminal referrals should be left to
the discretion of each board of directors, rather than requiring a report to the board of directors by their next scheduled
meeting. The intent of this section is to keep the board of directors informed when a known or suspected crime has been
committed against the institution. In response to the Council's comment, this section has been amended to require
that the board of directors be notified promptly of the filing of any Referral Form by the institution's management.
Reporting ``promptly'' to the board of directors means reporting the criminal referral at a regularly scheduled
meeting, or earlier if the estimated loss is of such magnitude that it would have a significant impact on the safety
and soundness of the institution. Alternatively, reports involving insignificant losses may be summarized and
reported periodically at a regularly scheduled meeting of the board. Because violations of Federal criminal statutes
may affect the safety and soundness of FCS institutions and/or undermine public confidence in the FCS, a board of directors
should be promptly notified of all known or suspected criminal activities. Furthermore, boards of directors should
treat this information with the same degree of care and confidentiality as other similar types of information are
treated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed regulation was amended to provide some discretion in the event a member of the board of
directors is the subject of a criminal referral. In this instance, it may be appropriate to seek guidance from legal
counsel or other appropriate sources.

2002(a)) including, but not limited to, associations, banks, service corporations chartered under section 4.25
of the Act, the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation,
the Farm Credit Leasing Services Corporation, and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (hereinafter,
institutions). The purposes of this part are to ensure the reporting of known or suspected criminal activity, the
safety and soundness of the institution, and public confidence in the Farm Credit System, thereby reducing potential
losses to institutions. This part requires that institutions use the Farm Credit Administration Criminal Referral
Form to notify the appropriate Federal authorities when any known or suspected Federal criminal violations of the
type described in &sect;617.2 are discovered by an institution.

(b) The specific referral requirements of this part are limited to known or suspected criminal violations of the United
States Code involving the assets, operations, or affairs of an institution. This part prescribes procedures for
referring those violations to the proper Federal authorities and the Farm Credit Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Nothing in this part should be construed as reducing in any way an institution's responsibility to report known
or suspected criminal activities to the appropriate investigatory or prosecuting authorities, whether State or
Federal, even if circumstances required for a report under &sect;617.2 are not present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each referral required by &sect;617.2(a) shall be made on the Referral Form in accordance with the Referral Form
Instructions relating to its filing and distribution and the requirements of &sect;617.2 (b) and (c).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Each institution and its board of directors shall exercise due diligence to ensure the discovery, investigation,
and reporting of criminal activity. Within 30 calendar days of determining that there is a known or suspected criminal
activity, the institution shall refer such criminal violation of the United States Code involving or affecting its
assets, operations, or affairs to the appropriate regional offices of the United States Attorney and either or both
the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the United States Secret Service, using the Referral Form. In the event that
a Farm Credit Bank makes a loan through a Federal land bank association which services the loan, the Farm Credit Bank
has the responsibility to refer known or suspected criminal violations under this section. A report is required in
circumstances where there is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any known or suspected criminal activity (e.g., theft, embezzlement), mysterious disappearance, unexplained
shortage, misapplication, or other defalcation of property and/or funds, regardless of amount, where an institution
employee, officer, director, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such an institution
is suspected; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving an actual or potential loss (before reimbursement or recovery)
of $1,000 or more, through false statements or other fraudulent means, where the institution has a substantial basis
for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects and the suspect(s) is not an employee, officer, director,
agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such an institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving an actual or potential loss (before reimbursement or recovery)
of $5,000 or more, through false statements or other fraudulent means, where the institution has no substantial basis
for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving a financial transaction in which the institution was used
as a conduit for such criminal activity (such as money laundering/structuring schemes). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A copy of the completed Referral Form, accompanied by any relevant documentation, shall be provided to the Farm
Credit Administration's Office of General Counsel no later than 30 calendar days after the institution's management,
has discovered (or should have discovered) a known or suspected criminal violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In circumstances where there is also a known or suspected violation of State or local criminal law, the institution
shall also notify the appropriate State law enforcement authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the institution shall immediately notify by
telephone the offices specified on the Referral Form upon discovery of cases involving known or suspected criminal
violations requiring urgent attention or where a referable violation is ongoing. Such cases include, but are not
limited to, those where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) There is a likelihood that the suspect(s) will flee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The magnitude or the continuation of the known or suspected criminal violation may imperil the institution's
continued operation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Key institution personnel are involved.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Coast Guard is considering a proposal to establish a special local regulation for the Marine Event, Thunder on
the Water. This event will be held on the Niagara River, Tonawanda Channel, Tonawanda, NY from 10 a.m. (EDST) until
6 p.m. (EDST) on August 27, 1994 and from 11 a.m. (EDST) until 6 p.m. and August 28, 1994. This event will have an estimated
70 inboard hydroplanes and runabouts, racing a closed course race on the Niagara River, Tonawanda Channel which could
pose hazards to navigation in the area. A special local regulation which would restrict vessel traffic in the area
is necessary to ensure the safety of life, limb and property on portions of the Niagara River, Tonawanda Channel during
this event.

Discussion of proposed regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Thunder on the Water will be conducted on the Niagara River, Tonawanda Channel, between the South Grand Island
Bridge and Tonawanda Island, on August 27, and 28, 1994. This event will have an estimated 70 inboard hydroplanes and
runabouts racing in a closed race course, oval in shape, approximately 0.5 nautical miles long, 0.25 nautical miles
wide, running northeast/southwest in the Tonawanda Channel which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. In
order to provide for the safety of life, limb and property, the Coast Guard is considering a proposal to regulate vessel
traffic within this section of the Niagara River, Tonawada Channel. Commercial vessels desiring to transit the regulated
area shall provide prior notification to the Coast Guard Patrol Commander. Any vessels desiring to transit the regulated
area may do so only with prior approval of the Coast Guard Patrol Commander (Officer in Charge, U.S. Coast Guard Station
Buffalo, NY).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1233 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 100.

Federalism Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and
it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Environment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposed regulation and concluded that, under section
2.B.2.c of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are categorically excluded from further environmental
documentation.

Economic Assessment and Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does
not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted
from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies
and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the
regulatory policies and procedures of the DOT is unnecessary.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve Indiana's 1990 base year ozone precursor
inventories for certain ozone nonattainment areas as a revision to the Indiana ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP).
The emission inventories were submitted by the State of Indiana to satisfy a Federal requirement that States containing
ozone nonattainment areas submit inventories of actual ozone precursor emissions in accordance with USEPA guidance.
The ozone nonattainment areas covered by the emission inventories addressed in this rulemaking are Evansville (Vanderburgh
County); Indianapolis (Marion County); Louisville (Clark and Floyd Counties); and South Bend/Elkhart (Elkhart
and St. Joseph Counties). In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the USEPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views
this as a noncontroversial revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is
set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final
rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed
rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested in commenting on this
notice should do so at this time.

I. February 11, 1993 Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 11, 1993, EPA proposed a streamlined, reduced regulatory management structure for certain widespread
hazardous wastes currently subject to full RCRA Subtitle C regulation, in an effort to facilitate their collection
and proper management (58 FR 8102). The proposed reduced regulatory structure, known as a special collection system,
is designed to ensure that management of these hazardous wastes is conducted in a manner that is protective of human
health and the environment, given the diffuse and diverse population of generators of these wastes. Proposed regulatory
language was included for hazardous waste batteries, and suspended and/or cancelled hazardous waste pesticides
that are recalled. Several other wastes, including hazardous waste thermostats, were also discussed briefly in
the preamble as possible additions to the special collection system. The Agency also included a proposed petition
process to be used to add additional wastes to the special collection system in the future, and criteria to identify
wastes that would be appropriate for addition. See 58 FR 8102, February 11, 1993 for a detailed discussion of the proposal.

II. Description of Available Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the February 11, 1993 ``universal wastes'' proposal (58 FR 8126) the Agency committed to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Analyze the costs of the current regulatory requirements for generators and collection facilities and
of the requirements [proposed]''; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;``Analyze whether there are significant reduced environmental benefits from the modifications being proposed'';
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Notice the analysis for comment prior to promulgating a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The document made available for comment by this notice, ``Analysis of Potential Cost Savings and the Potential for
Reduced Environmental Benefits of the Proposed Universal Wastes Rule,'' U.S. EPA, April 1994, presents these analyses.
Part I of the document summarizes the proposed universal wastes regulations and introduces the analyses. Part II
discusses and compares estimated costs of the existing Subtitle C regulations and of the proposed changes to these
regulations. The conclusion of this analysis is that the proposed regulations will result in total annual savings
of approximately 93 million dollars. A sensitivity analysis is also included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part III of the document discusses whether the proposed regulatory changes will significantly reduce the environmental
benefits provided by the current Subtitle C regulations. The conclusion of this analysis is that the proposed reduced
regulations will not significantly diminish the environmental protection currently provided by the full Subtitle
C regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is requesting comment on the methodology used and the results of both the cost analysis and the analysis
of potential significantly reduced environmental benefits.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend our regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require States to provide, as a condition of Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility, for mandatory enrollment of certain Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibles in employer-based group health plans determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-effective by States under guidelines approved by HCFA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and require States to pay all premiums, and all deductibles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations under these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group health plans for items and services otherwise covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the approved Medicaid State plans. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule would provide for Medicaid payment of premiums 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for certain individuals who are entitled to elect COBRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation coverage (see Public Law 99&hyph;272 and section 601 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a group health plan provided by an employer with 75 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more employees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Medicaid is the Federally assisted State program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized under title XIX of the Social Security Act (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act) to provide medical care to persons of limited means. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among these persons are those individuals who receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial assistance under title IV&hyph;A (Aid to Families of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dependent Children (AFDC)), and title XVI (Supplemental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Income (SSI)) and mandatory State supplements (SSP) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in the territories title XVI (Old-Age Assistance (OAA), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aid to the Blind (AB), Aid to the Permanently and Totally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disabled (APTD), Aid to the Aged, Blind or Disabled (AABD)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State determines the scope of its program, within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitations and guidelines established by the law and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing regulations at 42 CFR part 430 et seq. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State submits a State plan that, when approved by HCFA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides the basis for granting Federal funds to cover part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the expenditures incurred by the State for medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance and the administration of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(a) of the Act specifies the eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that individuals must meet in order to receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid. Other sections of the Act describe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility groups in detail and specify limitations on what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be paid for as ``medical assistance.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Statutory Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1905(a) of the Act, States may pay health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance premiums on behalf of eligible recipients. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such cases, the insurer is liable to pay for benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered under its plan but Medicaid continues to pay for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services covered under the Medicaid plan (but not covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the insurer's plan). In addition, State payment of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health insurance premium must not have the effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limiting a recipient's rights under Medicaid (for example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
freedom of choice among providers). Section 4402(a)(2) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 101&hyph;508, enacted on November 5, 1990, added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1906 to title XIX of the Act to require States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide, as a condition of Medicaid eligibility, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory enrollment of certain Medicaid eligibles in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer-based group health plans determined to be cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective under guidelines established by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision applies to the 50 States and the District of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia and includes any State providing Medicaid to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients under an experimental, pilot, or demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project under the waiver authority of section 1115 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. A group health plan is defined under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1906(e)(1) as having the same meaning given the term in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 5000(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the provision of COBRA continuation coverage by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a plan under title XXII of the Public Health Service Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VI of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ERISA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to adding section 1906 to the Act, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4402 of OBRA '90 made the following conforming amendments: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Added a new section 1902(a)(25)(G) to specify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State plans must meet the new requirements of section 1906 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for enrollment of individuals under group health plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Section 4402(a)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Added a new section 1902(e)(11)(A) to allow States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to continue Medicaid payments of premiums, deductibles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations on behalf of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Medicaid recipient required to enroll in a group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan for a State-defined period of up to 6 months after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of the recipient's enrollment, even if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollee ceases to be eligible for Medicaid during that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period, but only for services covered under the group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Added a new subparagraph (XI) in the matter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following section 1902(a)(10)(F) to allow Medicaid coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the cost of premiums, deductibles, coinsurances, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other cost-sharing obligations for individuals in cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective group health plans without requiring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of comparable services of the same amount, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duration and scope to any other individuals (Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4402(d)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Revised section 1903(u)(1)(D)(iv) to specify that in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the amount of erroneous excess payments for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of Federal financial participation (FFP), HCFA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not include any error with respect to Medicaid payments made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in violation of section 1906 of the Act (Section 4402(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Revised section 1905(a) by adding language to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate that ``medical assistance'' may include expenditures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Medicare cost-sharing and premiums under Part B for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals who are eligible for medical assistance and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AFDC, SSI, OAA, AB, APTD, or AABD recipients or SSP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries and are eligible for medical assistance made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to individuals described in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(10)(A); and, except in the case of individuals 65 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years of age or older and disabled individuals entitled to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare who are not enrolled under Medicare Part B, other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance premiums for medical or any other type of remedial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care or cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Revised section 1903(a)(1) to delete the reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Medicaid expenditures for Medicare cost-sharing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premiums under Part B. This language was added to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1905 of the Act in the definition of medical assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4402 of OBRA '90 has also undermined the legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pottgeiser v. Sullivan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 906 F.2d 1319 (9th Cir. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990). In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pottgeiser
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the United States Court of Appeals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a lower court's ruling that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the definition of ``medical assistance'' under section 1905(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act did not include the payment of medical insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premiums. We note that the Ninth Circuit issued its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pottgeiser 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decision on June 25, 1990. However, section 4402 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of OBRA '90 subsequently amended section 1905(a) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to include the payment of medical insurance premiums 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressly within the definition of ``medical assistance.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we regard section 4402 of OBRA '90 as superseding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation, which effectively nullifies any legal effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pottgeiser
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Identification of Cost-Effective Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1906(a)(1) requires States to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines that are established by the Secretary to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases in which enrollment of a Medicaid eligible individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a group health plan (in which the individual is otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible to be enrolled) is cost-effective. In section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1906(e)(2) of the Act, the term ``cost-effective'' means the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of paying the premiums and cost-sharing obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a group health plan is likely to be less than the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of providing services covered under the State plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine cost-effectiveness, we would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States to use the cost-effectiveness methodology included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their approved State plan. States are required to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the methodology described in &sect;3910.11 of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid Manual (HCFA Pub. 45&hyph;3), or an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology that could be supported by documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished by a State. The State's alternative methodology, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at a minimum, must include factors accounting for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee's premiums, coinsurance, deductibles, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-sharing obligations under the group health plan. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must compare these factors to the State's average Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures for an equivalent set of services for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual with similar characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To comply with the section 1906 requirement that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary establish cost-effectiveness guidelines, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restating the information contained in the State Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manual as an example of an acceptable methodology that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State must include in its State plan.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our guidelines consist of the following steps:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 1_Policy Information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency obtains information on all group health plans available to the Medicaid recipient. The Medicaid recipient
is responsible for providing the State with all the necessary plan information and reporting changes with respect
to plan benefits. This information must include the effective date of the policy, any exclusions to enrollment, the
services covered under the policy, the employee's share of premiums paid to the health plan and other costs that may
be necessary for enrollment in the plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 2_Average Medicaid Costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), the agency obtains the average total annual Medicaid costs
of persons having characteristics similar to the applicant (age, sex, categorical group and geographic data).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 3_Medicaid Costs for Included Services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency determines the amount of the total yearly Medicaid expenditures for services covered by the specific group
health policy. Compute the percentage of expenditures for group health plan services to expenditures for Medicaid
services. Then adjust the average total annual Medicaid costs specified in step 2 by this percentage. This is the ``Medicaid
average covered expense amount.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 4_Group Health Plan Costs for Included Services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency adjusts the Medicaid average covered expense amount (amount calculated in step 3) for the higher prices
employer plans typically pay. The agency may use a single State-specific factor derived from experience with third
party liability (TPL) claims or use group health plan specific information. Alternatively, the agency may use a national
average factor which HCFA supplies and updates periodically. The Medicaid covered expense is multiplied by this
factor to produce an estimated covered expense as recognized by the employer health plan. This is the ``health plan
cost.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 5_Adjustment for Coinsurance and Deductible Amounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The health plan cost (amount from step 4) is multiplied by an average employer health insurance payment rate to obtain
the ``employer recognized covered expense'' amount. The agency derives the average employer health insurance payment
rate from State specific tables, if available, or group health plan specific information. Alternatively, for State
agency use, HCFA supplies and periodically updates national tables. This health insurance average payment rate
number will vary in relation to the amount of the average employer recognized covered expense.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 6_Administrative Costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency accounts for any additional Medicaid administrative costs incurred in processing the group health information
by determining the average increase in cost per recipient. These costs may include all up-front administrative costs
associated with the implementation of this provision. These costs must be amortized over a 5-year period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 7_Cost-Effectiveness Calculation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the costs under the group health plan to those costs under Medicaid. This comparison is as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Group Health Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Subtract the employer recognized covered expense (step 5) from the health plan cost (step 4) (the figure obtained
is the proxy for deductibles, coinsurance and limitations within group health plans);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add the employee's share of premiums paid (step 1); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add the additional administrative costs (step 6) (the figure obtained is the total State costs under the group
health plan).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Medicaid Expenditures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Subtract the total State costs, obtained above, from the Medicaid average covered expense amount (step 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Cost-effectiveness is achieved if costs calculated under the group health plan are lower than costs calculated
for the same services under Medicaid. (See example on determining cost-effectiveness.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When non-Medicaid eligible family members are enrolled in group health plans in order to enroll the Medicaid eligible
family member, do 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
include the deductible, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations for non-Medicaid eligible family members
in calculations.

Step 1_Policy Information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Obtain information on all group health plans available to the Medicaid recipient. This information must include
the effective date of the policy, exclusions to enrollment, the covered services under the policy and the employee's
share of premiums paid to the health plan.

of the Medicaid costs in the example State. On an average annual basis, the costs to Medicaid of providing the six services
offered under the group health plan are:

Adjust the Medicaid average covered expense amount (amount from step 3) for the higher prices employer plans typically
pay. Use either a single State specific factor derived from experience with TPL, group health plan specific information,
or a national factor supplied by HCFA. For the purpose of this example, 1.3 was used as a factor. The Medicaid covered
expense is multiplied by this factor to produce an estimated covered expense as recognized by the employer plan.

3. Condition of Eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1906(a)(2) of the Act, an otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid eligible individual who is also eligible to enroll 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an employer-based group health plan, which the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines under the Secretary's guidelines to be cost-effective, must enroll in the group health plan as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of his or her continued eligibility for Medicaid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We interpret this requirement to mean that if a Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient is currently enrolled in a non-employer-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plan and is also eligible to enroll in a cost- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective employer-based group health plan, the recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must enroll in the cost-effective group health plan to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain his or her Medicaid eligibility. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued enrollment in the non-employer-based plan is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory. This requirement must be met at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of initial eligibility or, for current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid recipients, at the time of an eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redetermination with certain exceptions as provided by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute. If more than one cost-effective group health plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is identified by the State, the individual has the option of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolling in the cost-effective plan of his or her choice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If an individual meets the plan enrollment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements and the request is denied by the plan, he or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she will have met the conditions of this provision. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1906(b)(1) of the Act, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(and, consequently, States) must take into account that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual may only be eligible to enroll in group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans at limited times (open season) and only if other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals (not necessarily eligible for nor entitled to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical assistance under the State plan) are also enrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the group health plan simultaneously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the availability for enrollment in the group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan and eligibility to Medicaid benefits do not coincide, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State should have a procedure in place for recontacting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals prior to the next enrollment period. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid recipient will be entitled to receive Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services pending that recipient's application to enroll in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the group health plan during the next open season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although enrollment in a cost-effective group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan is a condition of Medicaid eligibility, an individual's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disenrollment from a group health plan is permissible under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these circumstances: (1) The State reevaluates the cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of the group health plan during the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redetermination of the individual's eligibility, (2) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group health plan is no longer available, for example, due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the individual leaving employment or changing jobs, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the individual was enrolled through a spouse who is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer willing to enroll the individual.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1906(a)(2) requires every individual entitled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to receive Medicaid to apply for enrollment in a cost- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective group health plan as a condition of initial or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued eligibility for Medicaid. However, under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1906(b)(2), enrollment in the group health plan is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of initial or continued Medicaid eligibility for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child if a parent fails to enroll that child. We also note 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that where a Medicaid eligible spouse (for example, a wife) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot apply for enrollment in her husband's group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan if her husband fails to enroll her, she will not lose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for Medicaid by virtue of his failure to enroll 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her. This is because the section 1906(a)(2) requirements do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply to a Medicaid eligible spouse who does not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the independent ability to apply for enrollment in a cost- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective group health plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Services Covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1906(c)(2) of the Act, an individual's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment in a group health plan does not change the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual's eligibility for benefits under the State plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, under section 1902(a)(25), Medicaid is a payer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last resort with respect to services covered under the group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plan. In other words, the group health plan's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment is considered primary to any Medicaid payments. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State must pay for services covered under the State plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are not otherwise included in the group health plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the terms and conditions applicable to all other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid recipients. States must establish their own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures to pay for Medicaid services that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included under the group health plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We recognize that some providers that participate in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group health plans may not be Medicaid-participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers. Of course, States should always encourage all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers to participate in Medicaid. However, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest of State flexibility, we are offering several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options that States may elect to resolve problems that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arise from non-Medicaid-participating providers furnishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services to Medicaid recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, States that deem providers to be Medicaid-participating providers merely through the submission of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bill for services to the State Medicaid agency (as is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently permitted for qualified Medicare beneficiaries) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may similarly do so for providers in cost-effective group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plans. In lieu of this voluntary provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangement, States could require that all providers in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-effective group health plan bill States directly for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residual charges on services provided to Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients. In other words, States may deem all providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in cost-effective group health plans to be Medicaid- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating providers by billing the State directly for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any care or services provided under the group health plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are otherwise covered under the State Medicaid plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but which are not fully paid by the group health plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, States may ascertain what percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers in a group health plan participate in Medicaid, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and incorporate that percentage into the determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a group health plan is cost-effective. If the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that fewer than a certain percentage (specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the State) of all providers in a group health plan are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not Medicaid-participating providers, the group health plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be cost-effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If either of these options is not feasible for a State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we will allow a State to reimburse recipients directly in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the event a recipient is billed directly for any care or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services provided under the group health plan, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise covered under the State Medicaid plan, but which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not fully paid by the group health plan. We will allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States to pay recipients directly where a State demonstrates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that failure to do so would render section 1906 of the Act a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nullity. A situation in which the provisions of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1906 could not be effectuated but for direct payment to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients presents extraordinary circumstances sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to justify direct payment to recipients. Under any of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenarios, a State would have to pay for all cost-sharing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations, even if such costs are above the State's usual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid rate for services provided to Medicaid recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the State agency must pay for an eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollee's premiums for a group health plan determined cost- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective, and for all deductibles, coinsurance, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-sharing obligations under the group health plan for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
items and services otherwise covered under the State plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 1906(a)(3). Further, when a non-Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible family member must first be enrolled in a group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plan in order for the Medicaid eligible member to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive coverage, section 1906(c)(1)(B) provides that where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is determined to be cost-effective (taking into account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment of all such additional premiums), Medicaid payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is available for the premiums (but no other forms of cost-sharing) of the non-Medicaid eligible member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5. Payment Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the State must treat payment for services covered under the group health plan as a third party liability
under section 1902(a)(25) of the Act. Where Medicaid must participate in cost-sharing for deductibles and coinsurance,
the State is required to reimburse all cost-sharing at the employer-based group health plan payment rate. The State
is not required to pay for the nominal cost-sharing amounts otherwise permitted under section 1916 of the Act which
are the recipient's responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(e)(11) of the Act provides States with the option to continue payments to the group health plan on behalf
of a Medicaid recipient after the recipient ceases to be eligible for Medicaid for a maximum period of 6 months from
the effective date of the recipient's required enrollment in the group health plan under section 1906(a). A State
electing this option must include this provision in its State plan, and should specify the length of the applicable
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Federal Financial Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1906(c)(1) specifies that, for purposes of section 1903(a) of the Act, FFP is available as ``medical assistance''
for all premiums, deductibles, coinsurance and other cost-sharing obligations under the group health plan for services
covered under the State plan. However, if the State imposes nominal cost sharing under section 1916 of the Act, payment
of such amounts are the recipient's responsibility and are not paid for under section 1906. Therefore, FFP is not available
for the nominal cost-sharing amounts otherwise permitted under section 1916 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a non-Medicaid eligible family member must be enrolled in the group health plan in order to obtain coverage for the
Medicaid eligible, FFP is available for premiums only (but not for any other cost-sharing expenses) for the non-Medicaid
eligible family member(s) as payment for medical assistance for the eligible individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a Medicaid recipient's group health plan offers a wider array of services than those services covered under the
State plan, no FFP is available for the deductibles, coinsurance and other cost-sharing obligations for non-covered
services. For States that elect to cover individuals during the optional period allowed under section 1902(e)(11),
FFP would be restricted to the individual's premiums and appropriate deductibles and coinsurance for services provided
to the individual under the group health plan, and would not be available for payment for any other items and services
covered by the State plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a Medicaid recipient is currently enrolled in a non-employer-based health plan and is also eligible to enroll in
a cost-effective group health plan, the recipient must enroll in the cost-effective group health plan to maintain
his or her Medicaid eligibility. If enrollment in both health plans remains cost-effective, FFP is available for
the premiums of the non-employer-based plans specified in section 1905(a) of the Act. However, continued enrollment
in the non-employer-based plan is not mandatory.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Many cost-effective prepaid type group health plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(for example, health maintenance organizations (HMOs)), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose strict requirements on care and services that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursed under the plan. These requirements may include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of certain providers exclusively and/or prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization for the need for care or services. If an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollee receives services which are not in compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan requirements, and the group health plan consequently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refuses reimbursement for services usually covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan, under section 1902(a)(17)(B) of the Act, FFP would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be permitted for any service that is generally available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recipient without cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Determination and Redetermination of Eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our rules concerning determination and redetermination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of eligibility for the 50 States and the District of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia are found in 42 CFR part 435, subpart J. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules are not affected by this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Changes in the Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose to amend part 435 (Eligibility in States, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
America Samoa) as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Eligibility Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;We would revise &sect;435.3, Basis, to add new bases for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 435 resulting from amendments to title XIX of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by section 4402 of OBRA '90. Section 1902(e)(11) concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 6-month maximum optional enrollment period in a cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective group health plan. Section 1903(u)(1) concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of erroneous payments made in violation of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1906 of the Act. Section 1905(a) concerns expenditures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare cost-sharing and premiums under Part B. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1906 concerns the requirement that Medicaid eligibles enroll 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in group health plans determined to be cost-effective under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines established by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 435.10, State plan requirements, would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised to specify that State plans must require that, as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of eligibility, individuals must enroll in group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plans where the State agency determines it is cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective to pay for that individual's premiums, deductibles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other cost-sharing obligations, using guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the Secretary. The plan also must comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the requirements in a new &sect;435.186, Medicaid payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for recipients enrolled in cost-effective group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans. In that new section, we would require that the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay for all premiums, and deductibles, coinsurance and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-sharing obligations (other than nominal copayments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted under section 1916 of the Act) for Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients for items and services covered under the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan. We would require the State to pay premiums only for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-Medicaid recipient when that person must enroll in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group health plan in order for the Medicaid eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual to be enrolled, and only when the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines it to be cost-effective to do so. We would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the State to treat the group health plan as a third 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party resource in accordance with third party liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements specified in &sect;433.138, except that FFP would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be available in expenditures for services provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients who were eligible in the month in which services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were provided as provided under &sect;435.1002. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A new &sect;435.611, Limitation of payment for special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups of individuals, would be added to specify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptions and conditions of eligibility (of individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise eligible for Medicaid), for enrollment and payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and other cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sharing obligations for items and service in a group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Federal Financial Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 435.1002 would be revised to provide for FFP in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures for payment of premiums, deductibles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations on behalf of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a recipient enrolled in a cost-effective group health plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on behalf of individuals who are no longer eligible but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed eligible under the 6-month enrollment option and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premiums for individuals who must be enrolled.

B. COBRA Continuation Coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Statutory Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1985 (COBRA '85), Public Law 99&hyph;272, requires an employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with 20 or more employees that offers a group health plan to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offer employees the opportunity to elect continuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage under that plan after certain qualifying events 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(explained more fully below), that ordinarily result in loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of such coverage. This provision is popularly known as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
COBRA continuation coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4713 of OBRA '90 amended title XIX of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Social Security Act by adding a new section 1902(a)(10)(F) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a new section 1902(u) to specify an additional group of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals who may be eligible for a limited Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit payment of COBRA premiums for insurance coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions allow a State Medicaid agency the option to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay the group health insurance premiums for certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals who are entitled to elect COBRA continuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage. However, this provision, unlike the 20-employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in COBRA '85, only applies to group health plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by employers with 75 or more employees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``qualifying event'' with respect to any covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee, is defined by section 601 of ERISA, as amended by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to mean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any of the following events which, but for the continuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage, results in a loss of coverage of a qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiary: death of the covered employee; termination for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons other than an employee's misconduct, or reduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours, of the covered employee's employment; divorce or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal separation of the covered employee from the employee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spouse; entitlement of the employee under Medicare (title

Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended, 11 U.S.C. &sect;101 et seq. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(a)(10)(F), as added by section 4713 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA '90, provides States with the option of making medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance available for COBRA premiums, as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1902(u)(2), for qualified COBRA continuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiaries (CCBs), as defined in section 1902(u)(1) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act. Section 1902(u)(1) defines a CCB as an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who meets the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;He or she is entitled to elect COBRA continuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;He or she has income that does not exceed 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the official Federal poverty line applicable to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family of the size involved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;He or she has resources which do not exceed twice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the maximum amount of resources that an individual may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be eligible for benefits under the Supplemental Security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Income (SSI) program, as determined under section 1613 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Social Security Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The State has determined that the likely savings in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid expenditures resulting from enrollment in COBRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation coverage is expected to exceed the cost of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
COBRA premiums. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the cost-effectiveness determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for CCBs, States must determine that likely Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures on individuals would be higher (if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals were not enrolled in the COBRA plan) than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost the State would pay in COBRA continuation premiums. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other words, the State must determine that enrolling the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals in COBRA continuation coverage results in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings in likely Medicaid expenditures that exceed the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of paying the COBRA premiums. This requires the State to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make a reasonable decision that the individuals (or family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members that would be covered by the COBRA coverage) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to become eligible for Medicaid during the COBRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation period and that enrollment is expected to save 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
money for the Medicaid program. This decision would include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an assessment of whether the individuals would be likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become Medicaid eligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contemplating scenarios under which this cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness could be satisfied, we have identified a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of situations in which individuals would appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``likely'' ultimately to generate Medicaid expenditures in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of COBRA continuation coverage, even if they were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not currently Medicaid eligible. This would be true, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, of a COBRA-eligible individual who is HIV positive, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and accordingly is determined ``likely'' to become Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible based upon disability, and to incur Medicaid costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that exceed the cost of COBRA premiums. A COBRA eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual who is not eligible for Medicaid may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid-eligible family members who would be covered by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
COBRA continuation plan if COBRA premiums were paid by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State. In this case, savings in Medicaid expenditures would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be likely to result from the individual's enrollment even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
though he or she is not Medicaid eligible, nor expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become Medicaid eligible. Finally, a COBRA-eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual may be eligible for Medicaid as ``medically needy'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon the satisfaction of some modest ``spend-down'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. In such a case, it may well be reasonable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State to conclude that ``likely'' Medicaid expenditures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would exceed the cost of paying COBRA continuation premiums 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would have the effect of precluding the individual from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurring expenses sufficient to make him or her Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(u)(2) defines the term ``COBRA premiums'' as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicable premium imposed with respect to COBRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation coverage. Section 1902(u)(3) defines COBRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation coverage as coverage under a group health plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by an employer with 75 or more employees provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under title XXII of the Public Health Service Act, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or title VI of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Clause (XI) in the matter following section 1902(a)(10)(F), as amended by section 4713(a)(1)(D) of OBRA '90, requires
that medical assistance available to an individual defined in section 1902(u)(1) who is eligible for medical assistance
only because of section 1902(a)(10)(F) be limited to medical assistance for COBRA continuation premiums (as defined
in section 1902(u)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1905(a)(x), as added by section 4713(b) of OBRA '90 amends the definition of medical assistance to include
the new group of individuals described in section 1902(u)(1) who may be eligible for Medicaid through payment of premiums
for COBRA continuation insurance coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1902(u)(4) specifies that, for individuals who may qualify for Medicaid payment for COBRA continuation
coverage and who are receiving an optional State supplementary payment, the State must apply an income standard (as
determined under section 1612 of the Act) of no more than 100 percent of the Federal poverty level applicable to a family
of the size involved. In determining income, except for costs described under section 1612(b)(4)(B)(ii) of the Act
for certain functionally disabled individuals, the State must exclude costs incurred for medical care and for any
other type of remedial care under this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because individuals identified in section 1902(u)(4) are by definition already eligible for Medicaid, we are unaware
of the relevance of this provision to individuals eligible under section 1902(a)(10)(F). Moreover, we are unaware
of anything in the legislative history of section 4713 which indicates what Congress intended to accomplish by this
provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Eligibility Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In interpreting the provisions of section 1902(u)(1), we propose to require that a CCB must also meet the existing
general non-financial requirements or conditions of eligibility for medical assistance contained in our regulations
in 42 CFR part 435. These general requirements include, for example, the filing of an application for Medicaid (&sect;435.907),
furnishing a social security number (&sect;435.910), providing citizenship and residency information (&sect;&sect;435.406
and 435.408), and assigning rights to third party payments to the State Medicaid agency (&sect;435.604). However,
these individuals do not have to meet the categorical requirements of either the SSI or AFDC programs. An individual
who is otherwise eligible for Medicaid under the State plan may also be eligible as a CCB. An individual who is eligible
for Medicaid as a CCB as well as under some other Medicaid eligibility group may choose, as specified in &sect;435.404,
to have eligibility determined only under one category. However, the individual is not required to make such a choice.
The individual is entitled to have eligibility determined under all categories for which he or she may qualify. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an individual does not specifically and voluntarily choose to have his or her eligibility determined under a specific
category, and if he or she is eligible both as a CCB and under another group in the State plan, the individual is designated
as being eligible both as a CCB and the other group for which he or she is eligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Determination of Financial Eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining the income and resource eligibility for CCBs under section 1902(u)(1)(B) and (C), we would require
the State to use the income and resources methodologies of the SSI program under sections 1612 and 1613 of the Act, respectively.
By methodologies, we mean the methods for determining the individual's countable income and resources, that is,
the amounts that may be considered to be available to the individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Determination and Redetermination of Eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rules for timely determination of eligibility and periodic redetermination of eligibility set forth in existing
&sect;&sect;435.911 and 435.916 would apply to determinations and redeterminations of CCB eligibility. Specifically,
&sect;435.911 requires the State to establish time standards for determining eligibility, and inform the applicant
of what they are. Section 435.916 requires the State agency to redetermine Medicaid eligibility, with respect to
circumstances that may change, at least every 12 months or when it has knowledge of changes that may affect eligibility,
and requires States to have procedures for recipients to report changes that may affect their eligibility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An individual's effective date for Medicaid payment of COBRA premiums under sections 1902(a)(10)(F) and 1902(u)
can be no earlier than January 1, 1991, the effective date of section 4713 of OBRA '90. The individual's effective date
of eligibility date is based on the date of application and the date on which all eligibility criteria, including election
of COBRA continuation coverage, are met. CCBs are subject to the existing policy of up to 3 months retroactive eligibility
as specified in &sect;435.914.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose to amend part 435 (Eligibility in States, the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 435.10 and 436.10 would be revised and new &sect;&sect;435.240 and 436.274 would be added to specify criteria

III. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulation would not have a significant
economic impact on substantial number of small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition
of small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any final
rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 50 beds located outside a Metropolitan Statistical area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although these regulations do not themselves have a significant impact on the general economy, the statutory provisions
on which they are based are expected to have an impact. In particular, we have determined that the part of the regulation
dealing with section 4402 of OBRA '90 has the following savings impact for the Medicaid program:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
We used the following methodology to estimate these savings. We used data from the Current Population Survey (CPS)
and the National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES) to estimate the fraction of Medicaid recipients having access
to employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) but not currently enrolled in it: about 3 percent for children and 1/2 percent
for adults (including the disabled). We assumed that about 75 percent of these individuals would be subject to the
group health enrollment requirements. In addition, we assumed that ESI premiums rates are based on utilization which
is 80 to 90 percent of that of Medicaid enrollees for adults and children and 30 to 40 percent of these premiums on average.
Employee cost-sharing was estimated at 20 percent, and the ratio of Medicaid to employer plan recognized charges
was assumed to be about two-thirds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, we do not have the data to estimate the impact of section 4713 of OBRA '90 regarding optional Medicaid payment
of group health plan premiums for COBRA continuation beneficiaries. Although this legislation creates a new eligibility
group, we do not believe a significant number of individuals would become eligible. Further, this provision is optional
for the States. To the extent these individuals become eligible for Medicaid, we believe this provision would reduce
expected future Medicaid costs through continued coverage by employer group health plans in lieu of Medicaid coverage
for a period of up to 29 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities and will not have a significant impact on the operation of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.
We have, therefore, not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basic requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency must_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Identify cases in which enrollment of a Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient in an employer-based group health plan is cost-effective and require, as a condition of eligibility, that
individuals (or in the case of a child, the child's parent) apply for enrollment in such plans, except as provided in
paragraph (c) of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Specify a methodology for determining the cost-effectiveness of an individual's enrollment in a group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plan that is acceptable to HCFA. The agency may_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Use the methodology established by the Secretary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Use an alternative methodology, which, at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum, must include factors accounting for the employee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premiums, coinsurance, deductibles, and other cost-sharing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations under the group health plan. It also must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compare these factors to the State's average Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditures for an equivalent set of services for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual in similar circumstances, and may include factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not specified in this paragraph, for example, considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients' diagnosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Include in its Medicaid plan provisions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment of all enrollee premiums necessary for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment, and all deductibles, coinsurance, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-sharing obligations for services under the State plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Medicaid recipients enrolled in an employer-based group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plan that has been determined by the State to be cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Provide for payment for premiums for non-Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible family members only if the cost-effective employer-based group health plan requires enrollment of a non-Medicaid
eligible family member as a condition for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid eligible family member to enroll in the group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Treat the group health plan as a third party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource in accordance with third party liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements as specified in &sect;435.138, except FFP is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available as provided in &sect;435.1002; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Specify that the Medicaid recipient will receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid services pending the submission of the group health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan application during the group health plan's next open 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parent of that child fails to enroll the child in a group 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard proposes to amend its vessel documentation regulations. The proposed amendments would clarify the
vessel documentation regulations by restating the citizenship requirements for trusts to reflect the Coast Guard's
policy; by correcting an existing cross-reference error regarding mortgagee consent for exchange of Certificates
of Documentation; by implementing statutory requirements concerning the endorsements on Certificates of Documentation
for dredges and towing vessels; and by making other minor technical amendments.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 15, 1993, the Coast Guard published a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 60256) which revised 46 CFR Part 67 to implement a number of statutory initiatives to simplify and streamline
the documentation process, to implement user fees for vessel documentation services, and to clarify the regulations
and present them in a more orderly fashion. The final rule was the subject to two correction documents which appeared
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 13, 1993, at 58 FR 65130 and 58 FR 65243. The final rule became effective on January 1, 1994. This rulemaking,
among other things, corrects certain errors and omissions in the final rule. It also clarifies the citizenship requirements
for a trust arrangement as a vessel-owning entity, and states the endorsements required for dredges and towing vessels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 7, 1998 Congress amended 46 U.S.C. app. &sect;316 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;329) to require towing vessels to be documented
with a coastwise or Great Lakes endorsement, as appropriate. On November 4, 1992, Congress amended 46 U.S.C. app.
&sect;292 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;587) to require vessels of at least five net tons engaged in dredging in the navigable
waters of the United States to be documented with a coastwise endorsement. Neither of these statutory requirements
were included in the revision of Part 67. In order to state those requirements and to clarify the endorsement requirements
for vessels employed in towing or dredging, the regulations need to be amended. This rulemaking proposes that amendment.

Discussion of Proposed Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard proposes to revise paragraphs (a) and (b) of &sect;67.19, which respectively describe a coastwide
and Great Lakes endorsement, by adding the words ``, dredging, towing,'' in paragraph (a), and adding the words ``,
towing in the Great Lakes,'' in paragraph (b). The revision to paragraph (a) reflects the requirement expressed in
46 U.S.C. app. &sect;292 that vessels engaged in dredging in the navigable waters of the United States be documented
with a coastwise endorsement. The revision to paragraph (b) reflects the requirement expressed in 46 U.S.C. app.
&sect;316 that vessels engaged in towing, other than in circumstances of distress, in waters subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States be documented with an appropriate coastwide or Great Lakes endorsement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard proposes to revise several sections regarding citizenship requirements for vessel documentation.
These revisions would reorder and set out the citizenship requirements for a partnership in a separate section; describe
the citizenship requirements for a trust in detail to specify the requirements for each endorsement; set out the citizenship
requirements for an association or joint venture in a separate section; and reorder the citizenship requirements
for a corporation. None of the current citizenship requirements for these entities would be changed by the revisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to &sect;67.35 would set out the citizenship requirements for a partnership in a separate section
and in a more logical order. Currently, &sect;67.35 sets out the citizenship requirements for a partnership, association,
or joint venture together. The partnership is frequently used as a vessel-owning business entity for documentation
purposes and has citizenship requirements quite different from those of an association or joint venture. On the other
hand, the citizenship requirements for an association or joint venture as a vessel-owning business entity for documentation
purposes are the same. Setting forth the citizenship requirements for a partnership in a separate section would present
them in a more appropriate format. None of the current citizenship requirements for a partnership would be changed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 67.37, which sets forth the citizenship requirements for trust arrangements as vessel-owning entities,
would be redesignated as &sect;67.36. In addition, the citizenship requirements for trust arrangements would be
described in detail, like those for corporations and partnerships, to specify the requirements for the relevant
endorsements. Paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;67.36 would set forth the general requirements for a registry or recreational
endorsement that each trustee and each beneficiary with an enforceable interest in the trust be citizens. This paragraph
would simply restate the current regulatory requirements for trusts found in &sect;67.37. Paragraphs (b) and (c)
of proposed &sect;67.36 would set forth the citizenship requirements for a fishery endorsement and a coastwise or
Great Lakes endorsement, respectively. These requirements would reflect the statutory citizenship requirements
for these endorsements applicable to any business entity owning a documented vessel. The owner citizenship requirements
for a coastwise or Great Lakes endorsement may be found in &sect;2 of the Shipping act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. app. &sect;802)
and 46 U.S.C. 12107, respectively, and the owner citizenship requirements for a fishery endorsement may be found
in 46 U.S.C. 12108. The proposed regulatory requirements would reflect the Coast Guard's policy in enforcement of
the statutory requirements. None of the current citizenship requirements for trusts would be changed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed addition of a new &sect;67.37 would set out the citizenship requirements for associations and joint
ventures as vessel-owning entities for documentation purposes. The citizenship requirements for associations
and joint ventures are currently stated in &sect;67.35 with those for partnerships. However, there is no logical
reason to continue this grouping. Separating the requirements for associations and joint ventures, which are identical,
from those for partnerships would present the information in a more logical and orderly fashion. None of the current
citizenship requirements for associations or joint ventures would be changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of &sect;67.39 would clarify the current regulations by rearranging
the citizenship requirements for corporations in a more logical order. None of the current citizenship requirements
for corporations would be changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to paragraph (e) of &sect;67.119 would clarify the current regulations. Paragraph (e) of &sect;67.119
was intended to serve as a savings or ``grandfather'' provision with regard to hailing port requirements for vessels
issued a Certificate of Documentation prior to July 1, 1982. The language of the final rule implies that the provisions
of the entire section do not apply to the identified vessels, rather than only the provisions of paragraph (c). This
revision will remove the confusion that currently exists because of the omission from the final rule. The proposed
revision would clearly state that only the requirements of paragraph (c) of &sect;67.119, specifically that a hailing
port include a State, territory, or possession designation, do not apply to vessels issued a Certificate of Documentation
before July 1, 1982, until:

b. the owner elects to designate a new hailing port. Therefore, vessels to which &sect;67.119(c) do not apply can display
a hailing port consisting of the name of a city only until either of the conditions described are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment to &sect;67.145 would correct the cross-reference to appropriate paragraphs in &sect;67.167
where mortgagee consent is required to exchange a Certificate of Documentation. The current regulation cites, in
part, to paragraph (a) of &sect;67.167, which is incorrect since that paragraph contains only procedural information
and refers to the remaining paragraphs of that section. This cross-reference error has led to confusion, causing
some documentation officers to conclude that mortgagee consent is required for any cause of exchange listed in &sect;67.167.
The reasons requiring mortgagee consent contained in the paragraphs referenced in the amended language are those
for which consent has been traditionally required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to paragraph (d) of &sect;67.171 would clarify that the request for a certificate evidencing
deletion from documentation must be made to the vessel's port of record. Since the port of record is the custodian of
the vessel's file, only that port should issue a deletion certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to &sect;67.321 would clarify that when the address of the managing owner of a vessel changes,
the managing owner must report that change to the documentation officer at the vessel's port of record within 10 days
of its occurrence. This revision would conform &sect;67.321 to a similar requirement in &sect;67.113. Unreported
changes of address have proved to be a particularly bothersome problem. If changes of address for the managing owner
are not reported, the Coast Guard may send the renewal notice to the wrong address which can lead to late renewal or a
failure to renew with civil penalty action. The proposed revision would clarify the responsibility of the managing
owner to provide proper notice of changes of address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revision to &sect;67.539, adding the words ``or document'', would clarify that the fee is charged for
a copy of any instrument or document for which a specific fee is not listed. Also, the revision would clarify that the
cross-reference to 49 CFR 7.95 is solely for the purpose of calculating the fee in the same manner as described in that
section. It does not mean that a request for a copy of any instrument or document not specifically identified in Subpart
Y of Part 67 is to be processed as a request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. Therefore, once the fee for the
copy has been calculated in the manner described in 49 CFR 7.95, it is incorrect to refer to any other section in 49 CFR
Part 7 for any purpose with regard to the fee.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under
paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. As discussed earlier in this preamble,
this proposal, if adopted, would clarify the citizenship requirements of a trust as a vessel-owning entity, correct
certain errors and omissions made in the final rule for 46 CFR part 67, clarify a cross-reference with regard to calculation
of fees for copies of instruments and documents, and address the statutorily required endorsements for vessels employed
in towing and dredging. These matters are administrative in nature and do not have any economic impacts on the regulated
public.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal because it would only clarify the structure of a trust
as a vessel-owning entity, correct certain errors and omissions made in the final rule for 46 CFR part 67, clarify a
cross-reference with regard to calculation of fees for copies of instruments and documents, and address the statutorily
required endorsements for vessels employed in towing or dredging. This proposal would bring the regulations into
conformity with current policy and practice. These matters are administrative in nature and do not have any economic
impacts on the regulated public. Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies
under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

proposal has been determined to be categorically excluded because the changes proposed are administrative in nature

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
By Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPR'' or ``Proposed Rule'') published in the Federal Register, 58 FR 68841&hyph;68843
(Dec. 29, 1993), the Commission proposed to amend Rule 113, 46 CFR 502.113 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and
Procedure to make the complainant in a private action responsible for service of its complaint when the Commission
has been unsuccessful, for any reason, in effectuating service by certified or registered mail.

The only comment in response to the NPR was filed by the Maritime Administrative Bar Association (``MABA''), which
opposes the Proposed Rule.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Rule 113, the Commission is presently charged with the responsibility for service of private complaints, amendments
to complaints, and complainant's memoranda filed in shortened procedure cases, while Rule 114, 46 CFR 502.114, requires
that parties serve all other pleadings.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In administering Rule 113, the Commission has experienced occasions where complaints and other pleadings were returned
by the United States Postal Service because the respondent refused delivery, an incorrect address was provided by
the complainant, or the respondent had moved leaving no forwarding address. In such circumstances, the Commission
has resorted to alternative methods of service such as utilizing a Commission investigator to personally find and
serve the respondent, or serving the secretary of state pursuant to state law. The NPR noted that the Proposed Rule
would conform the Commission's Rules regarding service more closely to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Section 502.114 provides that all pleadings, documents, and papers (except requests for subpoenas) in proceedings
before the Commission shall, when tendered to the Commission or the presiding officer for filing, show that service
has been made upon all parties to the proceeding, and upon any other persons required to be served.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In opposing the Proposed Rule, MABA argues that the Shipping Act, 1916, 46 U.S.C. app. 821, and the Shipping Act of 1984,
46 U.S.C. app. 1710(b) (``Shipping Acts''), prohibit the Commission from shifting the burden of ``personally serving
private complaints from the Commission to private parties.'' Comments at 1&hyph;2. MABA's position is that only
the Commission can serve the complaint, and that a ``rule is which service of the complaint is performed by someone
other than the Commission does not comply with the clear statutory command that the Commission `shall furnish' a copy
of the complaint.''

 at 2. Regarding the Commission's interest in bringing Rule 113 in conformity with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
MABA contends that the Federal Rules ``are not underlain by a similar statutory obligation that the district court
`furnish a copy of the complaint' to a defendant.''

MABA argues that the Shipping Acts' statutory provisions governing complaints mean what they say and that the Commission
is compelled to serve a respondent on behalf of a private complainant. It contends that because the Commission has
national jurisdiction, field offices, and an extensive regulated persons index, it is also in a better position to
personally serve the respondent. MABA believes that the Proposed Rule would place the burden of personal service
on small companies, thereby acting as a possible barrier to the prosecution of claims before the agency, and exacerbating
whatever service problems now exist.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon a reevaluation of the concerns that prompted this proposal, the Commission has decided not to proceed to a final
rule. Any actual service of process difficulties in a specific case will be addressed on an ad hoc basis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule publishes for public comment regulations that adopt the recommendations of the Government-Industry
Technical Data Advisory Committee established pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years
1992 and 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;190).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act required the Secretary of Defense to form a Government-Industry advisory committee to develop recommended
regulations to supersede the interim regulations which presently implement requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2320, Rights
in Technical Data. Committee meetings began in July 1992 and ended in December 1993. The committee concluded that
the existing regulations are a disincentive to companies that create new technology with their own funding to provide
that technology to the Defense Department. The committee believes this proposed regulation establishes a balance
between data developers' and data users' interests and will encourage creativity, encourage firms to offer DoD new
technology, and facilitate dual use development. The protection of privately developed data is crucial, particularly
for developers that have limited product lines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule revises and retitles Defense FAR Supplement Subpart 227.4, Rights in Technical Data; adds a new
Subpart 227.5, Rights in Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation; amends Subpart 211.70, Acquisition
and Distribution of Commercial Products; and, amends Part 252, Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses. Significant
differences from the exiting regulations are summarized below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
a. License Rights
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule identifies any government rights in technical data or computer software as specific, nonexclusive,
license rights the contractor has granted the Government. The standard license rights are defined in the proposed
clauses at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'' and 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights
in Noncommercial Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation.'' The rule provides that the contractor
retains all rights not granted to the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
b. Non-Standard License Rights
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule permits the negotiation of nonstandard license rights whenever the parties agree that the standard
rights are not appropriate for a particular procurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
c. Elimination of ``Required for Performance'' Criterion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Existing DFARS regulations permit DoD to obtain unlimited rights in technical data if development was ``required
for the performance of a government contract or subcontract.'' This proposed rule eliminates that criterion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
d. Clarification of Indirect Cost Treatment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
10 U.S.C. 2320 requires implementing regulations to define the treatment of indirect costs. The existing regulations
require indirect costs of development to be considered government funded if development was required for the performance
of a government contract. This proposed rule provides for all development accomplished with costs charged to indirect
cost pools to be considered development accomplished at private expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
e. Standard Government Purpose Rights
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The existing rule gives the government unlimited rights in technical data that pertain to items, components, or processes
developed with a mix of private and government funds unless the developer requests the exclusive right to commercialize
and a license can be negotiated. It does not permit negotiations when the government anticipates the data will be needed
for reprocurement. This proposed rule replaces those criteria with a standard license, applicable in all mixed funding
situations, which is intended to recognize mixed funded development. The license allows the government to use the
data for governmental purposes, including competition, but does not allow commercial use. Government purpose rights
will be effective for five years following award of the development contract or subcontract or such other period as
the parties negotiate. The Government has unlimited rights in the data upon expiration of the government purpose
rights period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
f. Segregation of Development Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule allows private expense determinations to be made at the lowest practicable level when determining
rights in technical data or computer software.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
g. Commercial Items (Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The clause at 252.211&hyph;7015, ``Technical Data and Computer Software_Commercial Items is removed. This proposed
regulation adds a clause at 252.227&hyph;7015, ``Technical Data_Commercial Items'' that generally requires DoD
to acquire only the technical data pertaining to commercial items or processes that are customarily provided to the
public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
h. Separate Treatment for Computer Software
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A new Subpart 227.5, ``Rights in Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation'' and a new clause, 252.227&hyph;7014,
``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Computer Software Documentation'' are proposed to separate Computer
software from technical data. This separation increases the volume of the regulations but provides greater flexibility
to deal with new statutory requirements or technological advancements that affect either technical data or computer
software only or affect both to varying degrees. The term computer software documentation is defined in these regulations
to mean owner's manuals, user's manuals, installation instructions, and similar items that explain the capabilities
of the software or provide instructions for use. Therefore, although computer software documentation is a form of
technical data (10 U.S.C. 2302(4), most applicable requirements are contained in the software Subpart and clause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
i. Software Related Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
(1) The definitions of ``computer program'', ``computer software'', and ``computer software documentation''
are revised. Definitions of ``developed'' are added for computer programs, software, and documentation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
(2) The definition of ``restricted rights'' is revised. The existing rule's right to use software with the computer
for which it was acquired is replaced by the right to use a program with one computer at one time. The Government's rights
to transfer programs, modify restricted rights software, and permit others to use or modify software for the Government
in specific situations, are clarified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
j. Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule provides that the Government shall have only the rights specified in the license under which the
commercial computer software or documentation is obtained. A contract clause is not prescribed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
k. Use and Nondisclosure Agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The standard nondisclosure agreement contained in the existing rule is amended. The proposed agreement covers third
party use and disclosure of all data or software in which the Government's rights are restricted. The proposed regulations
permit the use of class nondisclosure agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
l. Contracts Under the Small Business Innovative Research Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Alternate 1 to the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013 of the existing rule is replaced by a new clause, 252.227&hyph;7018,
``Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software_Small Business Innovative Research Programs.''
A single clause, rather than separate technical data and computer software clauses each with alternate provisions,
reduces contractual burdens on these small businesses. Data generated under these contracts is required to be protected
for five years instead of the four year statutory requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This proposed rule modifies the circumstances under which the Government may release or disclose technical data
or computer software to interested persons or permit those persons to use the technical data or computer software.
An initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA), that updates the IRFA submitted for DAR Case 87&hyph;303 on March
29, 1988, has been prepared and will be provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy for the Small Business Administration.
Comments are invited. Comments from small entities will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments
must be submitted separately and cite DAR Case 91&hyph;312 in correspondence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule implements information collection requirements under 10 U.S.C. 2321 and requires the submission
of other information to comply with requirements in 10 U.S.C. 2320 that are within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction
Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Required for repair or maintenance of commercial items or processes, or for the proper installation, operating,

solicitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To encourage offerors and contractors to offer or use commercial products to satisfy military requirements,
offerors and contractors shall not be required to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except for the technical data described in 227.402&hyph;1(a), furnish technical information related to commercial

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7015, ``Rights in Technical Data_Commercial Items'' provides the Government specific
license rights in technical data pertaining to commercial items or processes. Generally, DoD may use, modify, duplicate,
release, or disclose such data only within the Government. The data may not be used to manufacture additional quantities
of the commercial items and, except for emergency repair or overhaul, may not be released or disclosed to, or used by,
third parties without the contractor's express permission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If additional rights are needed, contracting activities must negotiate with the contractor to determine if there
are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. The specific additional rights granted to the Government shall
be enumerated in the contract license agreement or an addendum thereto.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Offerors shall not be required, either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for
award, to sell or otherwise relinquish to the Government any rights in technical data related to items, components
or processes developed at private expense except for the data identified at 227.403&hyph;5(a) (2) and (a)(4) through
(9).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

disclose technical data pertaining to those items may be restricted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) As provided in 10 U.S.C. 2305, solicitations for major systems development contracts shall not require offerors
to submit proposals that would permit the Government to acquire competitively items identical to items developed
at private expense unless a determination is made at a level above the contracting officer that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The offeror will not be able to satisfy program schedule or delivery requirements; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The offeror's proposal to meet mobilization requirements does not satisfy mobilization needs.

Acquisition of technical data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Procedures for acquiring technical data are contained in DoD 5010.12, DoD Data Management Program. Contracting
officers shall work closely with data managers and requirements personnel to assure that data requirements included
in solicitations are consistent with the policy expressed in 227.403&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) Data managers or other requirements personnel are responsible for identifying the Government's minimum
needs for technical data. Data needs must be established giving consideration to the contractor's economic interests
in data pertaining to items, components, or processes that have been developed at private expense; the Government's
costs to acquire, maintain, store, retrieve, and protect the data; reprocurement needs; repair, maintenance and
overhaul philosophies; spare and repair part considerations; and, whether procurement of the items, components,
or processes can be accomplished on a form, fit, or function basis. Reprocurement needs may not be a sufficient reason
to acquire detailed manufacturing or process data when replacement items or spare parts can be acquired using performance
specifications, form, fit and function data, or when there are a sufficient number of alternate sources which can
reasonably be expected to provide such items on a performance specification or form, fit, or function basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or other request for data, data managers must balance
the original assessment of the Government's data needs with data prices contained in the offer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Contracting officers are responsible for assuring that, to the maximum extent practicable, solicitations and
contracts_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Identify the type and quantity of the technical data to be delivered under the contract and the format and media
in which the data will be delivered;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As required by 10 U.S.C. 2320, establish each deliverable data item as a separate contract line item (this requirement
may be satisfied by listing each deliverable data item on an Exhibit to the contract);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Identify the prices established for each separately priced deliverable data item under a fixed price type contract;

Grant of license
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Government obtains rights in technical data, including a copyright license, under an irrevocable license granted
or obtained for the Government by the contractor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the data not granted
to the Government. For technical data that pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is
generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the item, component, or process. When the technical data
do not pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is determined by the source of funds used
to create the data.

. Contractors or licensors may, with some exceptions (see 227.403&hyph;5(a)(2) and (a) (4) through (9)), restrict
the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes
developed exclusively at private expense (limited rights). They may not restrict the Government's rights in items,
components, or processes developed exclusively at Government expense (unlimited rights) without the Government's
approval. When an item, component, or process is developed with mixed funding, the Government may use, release, or
disclose the data pertaining to such items, components, or processes within the Government without restriction
but may release or disclose the data outside the Government only for Government purposes (government purpose rights).

. Technical data may be created during the performance of a contract for a conceptual design or similar effort that
does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components or processes.
The Government generally obtains unlimited rights in such data when the data were created exclusively with Government
funds, government purpose rights when the data were created with mixed funding, and limited rights when the data was
created exclusively at private expense.

should be made at any practical sub-item or sub-component level or for any segregable portion of a process. Contractors
may assert limited rights in a segregable sub-item, sub-component, or portion of a process which otherwise qualifies
for limited rights under the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data.''

The standard license rights that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights,
or limited rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013. In unusual situations, the standard
rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in data in return
for other consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated
to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than
the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The situations under which a particular grant of license applies
are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Government purpose rights
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) The Government obtains government purpose rights in technical data_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed with mixed funding except when the Government is entitled
to unlimited rights as provided in 227.403&hyph;5 (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9); or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Created with mixed funding in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture,
construction, or production of items, components, or processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable. The clause at 252.227&hyph;7013
provides a nominal five year period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the government purpose
rights period may be made at any time prior to delivery of the technical data without consideration from either party.
Longer periods should be negotiated when a five year period does not provide sufficient time to apply the data for commercial
purposes or when necessary to recognize subcontractors' interests in the data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract
(or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required the development.
Upon expiration of the Government rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the data including the right
to authorize others to use the data for commercial purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, or authorize other persons to use, technical
data marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The Government shall not release or
disclose data in which it has government purpose rights to any person, or authorize others to do so, unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.403&hyph;7;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the data for performance of a Government
contract that contains the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, ``Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished
Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) When technical data marked with government purpose rights legends will be released or disclosed to a Government
contractor performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, the contract may be modified,
prior to release or disclosure, to include that clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and non-disclosure
agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that technical data marked with government purpose
rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a government solicitation,
only to persons subject to the use and non-disclosure restrictions. Public announcements in the Commerce Business
Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure requirements. Class use and non-disclosure
agreements (e.g., agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a reasonable period)
are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights data.
Documents transmitting government purpose rights data to persons under class agreements shall identify the technical
data subject to government purpose rights and the class agreement under which such data are provided.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Data in which the Government has limited rights may not be used, released, or disclosed outside the Government
without the permission of the contractor asserting the restriction except for a use, release or disclosure that is_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) To a foreign government, other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use, release, or disclosure
is in the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The person asserting limited rights must be notified of the Government's intent to release, disclose, or authorize
others to use such data prior to release or disclosure of the data except notification of an intended release, disclosure,
or use for emergency repair or overhaul which shall be made as soon as practicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Specifically negotiated license rights.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the Government
or when the Government wants to obtain rights in data in which it does not have rights. When negotiating to obtain, relinquish,
or increase the Government's rights in technical data, consider the acquisition strategy for the item, component,
or process, including logistics support and other factors which may have relevance for a particular procurement.
The Government may accept lesser rights when it has unlimited or government purpose rights in data but may not accept
less than limited rights in such data. The negotiated license rights must stipulate what rights the Government has
to release or disclose the data to other persons or to authorize others to use the data. Identify all negotiated rights
in a license agreement made part of the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the Government needs additional rights in data acquired with government purpose or limited rights, the contracting
officer must negotiate with the contractor to determine whether there are acceptable terms for transferring such
rights. Generally, such negotiations should be conducted only when there is a need to disclose the data outside the
Government or if the additional rights are required for competitive reprocurement and the anticipated savings expected
to be obtained through competition are estimated to exceed the acquisition cost of the additional rights. Prior to
negotiating for additional rights in limited rights data, consider alternatives such as_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Using performance specifications and form, fit, and function data to acquire or develop functionally equivalent
items, components, or processes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Obtaining a contractor's contractual commitment to qualify additional sources and maintain adequate competition
among the sources;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Reverse engineering, or providing items from Government inventories to contractors who request the items
to facilitate the development of equivalent items through reverse engineering.

(1) In the interest of the Government; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the
work for sale on behalf of the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7016, ``Rights in Bid or Proposal Data'', in solicitations and contracts when
the Government anticipates a need to use, subsequent to contract award, technical data included in a bid or proposal
that are not required to be delivered under the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, ``Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished Information
Marked with Restrictive Legends'', in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the Government will
provide the contractors, for performance of its contract, technical data marked with another contractor's government
restrictive legends.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Use the provision at 252.227&hyph;7028, ``Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government'',
in solicitations when the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver technical data. The provision
requires offerors to identify any technical data specified in the solicitation as deliverable data items that are
the same or substantially the same as data items the offeror has delivered or is obligated to deliver, either as a contractor
or subcontractor, under any other federal agency contract.

Deferred delivery.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7026, ``Deferred Delivery of Technical Data and Computer Software'', when it is in
the Government's interests to defer the delivery of technical data. The clause permits the contracting officer to
require the delivery of data identified as ``deferred delivery'' data at any time until two years after acceptance
by the Government of all items (other than technical data items) under the contract or contract termination, whichever
is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such technical data expires two years after the
date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor or supplier for use in the performance of the
contract. The contract must specify which technical data is subject to deferred delivery. The contracting officer
shall notify the contractor sufficiently in advance of the desired delivery date for such data to permit timely delivery
of the data.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7027, ``Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software'', when a firm requirement
technical data has not been established prior to contract award but there is a potential need for the data. Under this
clause, the contracting officer may order any technical data that has been generated in the performance of the contract
or any subcontract thereunder at any time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical data)
under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver such
technical data expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract. When
the data are ordered, the delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for converting the
technical data into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and delivery costs.

(1) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'', requires a contractor
to grant, or obtain for the government license rights which permit the government to reproduce data, distribute copies
of the data, publicly perform or display the data or, through the right to modify data, prepare derivative works. The
extent to which the government, and others acting on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard
data rights licenses obtained under the clause. When non-standard license rights in technical data will be negotiated,
negotiate the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not negotiate
a copyright license that provides fewer rights than the standard limited rights license in technical data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7013 does not permit a contractor to incorporate a third party's copyrighted data
into a deliverable data item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, when
applicable, others acting on the Government's behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer's written approval
to do so. Grant approval to use third party copyrighted data in which the government will not receive a copyright license
only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party material or when the use of the
third party material will result in cost savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright license.

Identification requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The solicitation provision at 252.227&hyph;7017, ``Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure
Restrictions'', requires offerors to identify to the contracting officer, prior to contract award, any technical
data that the offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction,
release or disclosure. This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright. The notification
and identification must be submitted as an attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the Attachment or
fails to complete the Attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision, such failure
shall constitute a minor informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality in accordance
with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.607. An offeror's failure to correct the informality within the time prescribed
by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted
restrictions or an offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the justification for an
asserted restriction or asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.403&hyph;13.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with
the procedures at 227.403&hyph;13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified. The contract
Attachment shall provide the same information regarding identification of the technical data, the asserted rights
category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph
(d) of the solicitation provision. Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical
Data_Noncommercial Items'' permits the contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The
additional assertions must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor nor the fact that certain assertions are identified
in the Attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As provided at 227.403&hyph;13,
the Government has the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision may be used in the source selection
process to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government's ability
to use or disclose technical data. However, offerors shall not be prohibited from offering products for which the
offeror is entitled to provide the Government limited rights in the technical data pertaining to such products and
offerors shall not be required, either as a condition or being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award,
to sell or otherwise relinquish any greater rights in technical data when the offeror to entitled to provide the technical
data with limited rights.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A contractor who desires to restrict the Government's rights in technical data to place restrictive markings
on the data, provides instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and authorizes the use of certain
restrictive markings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide to the Government any technical data in which the Government
has previously obtained rights with the Government's pre-existing rights in that data unless the parties have agreed
otherwise or restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose the data have
expired. When restrictions are still applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the data with the appropriate
restrictive legend for which the data qualified.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unmarked technical data.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Technical data delivered or otherwise provided under a contract without restrictive markings shall be presumed
to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be released or disclosed without restriction. To the extent practicable,
if a contractor has requested permission (see 227.403&hyph;10(c)(2)) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings,
do not release or disclose the technical data pending evaluation of the request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends placed on unmarked technical data at its expense.
The request must be received by the contracting officer within 6 months following the furnishing or delivery of such
data, or any extension of that time approved by the contracting officer. The person making the request must:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Identify the technical data that should have been marked; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the proposed marking is justified and conforms
with the requirements for the marking of technical data contained in the ``Rights in Technical Data_Non-commercial
Items'' clause at 252.227&hyph;7013; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability with respect to any disclosure, reproduction,
or use of the technical data made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the omission of the marking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Contracting officers should grant permission to mark only if the technical data were not distributed outside
the Government or were distributed outside the Government with restrictions on further use or disclosure.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'', requires a contractor,
and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data with other than unlimited rights, to establish
and follow written procedures to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain records
to justify the validity of asserted restrictions on delivered data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions'', requires contractors and their
subcontractors at any tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of restrictive markings on technical
data delivered or to be delivered under a Government contract.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonconforming markings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Authorized markings are identified in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data.'' All other
markings are nonconforming markings. An authorized marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from
the marking requirements in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013 is also a nonconforming marking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The correction of nonconforming markings on technical data is not subject to 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation
of Asserted Restrictions''. To the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return technical data bearing
nonconforming markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on such data to provide that person
an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming marking at that person's expense. If the person who has placed
the nonconforming marking on the technical data fails to correct the nonconformity and return the corrected data
within 60 days following the person's receipt of the data, the contracting officer may correct or strike the nonconformity
at that person's expense. When it is impracticable to return technical data for correction, contracting officers
may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government expense. Prior to correction of the nonconformity,
the data may be used in accordance with the proper restrictive marking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unjustified markings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) An unjustified marking is an authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions applicable to the
Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the marked technical
data. For example, a limited rights legend placed on technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes
that were developed under a Government contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations
under which the Government obtains unlimited or government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the validity of unjustified markings. However, at
any time during performance of a contract and notwithstanding the existence of a challenge, the contracting officer
and the person who has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon
such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, either_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's expense; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Return the technical data to the person asserting the restriction for correction at that person's expense. If
the data are returned and that person fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected
data to the contracting officer within sixty (60) days following receipt of the data, the unjustified marking shall
be corrected or stricken at that person's expense.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An offeror's assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose
technical data do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the Government's rights in the technical data. Under
10 U.S.C. 2321, the Government has the right to challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds
to question the validity of the assertion and continued adherence to the assertion would make it impractical to later
procure competitively the item to which the data pertain.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The challenge procedures required by 10 U.S.C. 2321 could significantly delay awards under competitive procurements.
Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award unless resolution of
the assertion is essential for successful completion of the procurement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Contracting officers must have reasonable grounds to challenge the current validity of an asserted restriction.
Before issuing a challenge to an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining
to the assertion. All challenges must be made in accordance with the provisions of the clause at 252.227&hyph;7037,
``Validation of Asserted Restrictions''.

 (i) After consideration of the situations described in 227.403&hyph;13(c)(3), contracting officers may request
the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation for
the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to determine the validity of the assertion.
Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by the person making the assertion
does not, in the contracting officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the person asserting the restriction fails to respond to the contracting officer's request for information
or additional supporting documentation or if the information submitted does not justify the asserted restriction,
a challenge should be considered.

 The clause at 252.227&hyph;7037 obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact matters under
the clause directly with a subcontractor, at any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting
officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge and validation matters directly with the
Government when_

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its technical data would be compromised if the data were

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond in a timely manner to a challenge and a failure to
respond would jeopardize a subcontractor's or supplier's right to assert restrictions; or,

Challenge notices must be in writing and issued to the contractor or, after consideration of the situations described
in 227.403&hyph;13(c)(3), the person asserting the restriction. The challenge notice must include the information

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a challenge notice,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Contracting officers must issue a final decision for each challenged assertion, whether or not the assertion has
been justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A contracting officer's final decision that an assertion is not justified must be issued as soon as practicable
following the failure of the person asserting the restriction to respond to the contracting officer's challenge
within sixty (60) days, or any extension to that time granted by the contracting officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A contracting officer who, following a challenge and response by the person asserting the restriction, determines
that an asserted restriction is justified, shall issue a final decision sustaining the validity of the asserted restriction.
If the asserted restriction was made subsequent to submission of the contractor's offer, add the asserted restriction
to the contract Attachment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A contracting officer who determines that the validity of an asserted restriction has not been justified shall
issue a contracting officer's final decision within the time frames prescribed in 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation
of Asserted Restrictions.'' As provided in paragraph (f) of that clause, the Government is obligated to continue
to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the Agency Head notifies the
person asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue
to respect the asserted restriction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the contracting officer who made the
earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall
consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify that all challenges apply to the same asserted
restriction and, after consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the restriction,
issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable opportunity to respond to each challenge.

Conformity, acceptance, and warranty of technical data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Statutory requirements. 10 U.S.C. 2320_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Requires contractors to furnish written assurance at the time technical data are delivered or are made available
to the Government that the technical data are complete, accurate, and satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning
such data; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provides for the establishment of remedies applicable to technical data found to be incomplete, inadequate,
or not to satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning such data; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Authorizes agency heads to withhold payments (or exercise such other remedies and agency head considers appropriate)
during any period if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract pertaining to the delivery of technical
data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Conformity and acceptance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Solicitations and contracts requiring the delivery of technical data shall specify the requirements the data
must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting officers, or their authorized representatives, are responsible for
determining whether technical data tendered for acceptance conform to the contractual requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7030, ``Technical Data_Withholding of Payment'' provides for withholding up to
ten percent of the contract price pending correction or replacement of the nonconforming technical data or negotiation
of an equitable reduction in contract price. The amount subject to withholding may be expressed as a fixed dollar amount
or as a percentage of the contract price. In either case, the amount shall be determined giving consideration to the
relative value and importance of the data. for example_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When the sole purpose of a contract is to produce the data, the relative value of that data may considerably higher
than the value of data produced under a contract where the production of the data is a secondary objective; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When the Government will maintain or repair items, repair and maintenance data may have a considerably higher
relative value than data that merely describe the item or provide performance characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Do not accept technical data that do not conform to the contractual requirements in all respects. Except for nonconforming
restrictive markings (see 227.403&hyph;14(b)(4)), correction or replacement of nonconforming data, or an equitable
reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of the nonconforming data is not practicable or is not
in the Government's interests, shall be accomplished in accordance with_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and acceptance of deliverables and remedies for
nonconforming deliverables; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract does not contain an inspection clause providing
remedies for nonconforming deliverables. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Follow the procedures at 227.403&hyph;12(a)(2) if nonconforming markings are the sole reason technical data
fail to conform to contractual requirements. The clause at 252.227&hyph;7030 may be used to withhold an amount from
payment, consistent with the terms of the clause, pending correction of the nonconforming markings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Warranty. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The intended use of the technical data and the cost, if any, to obtain the warranty should be considered before deciding
to obtain a data warranty (see FAR 46.703). The fact that a particular item, component, or process is or is not warranted
is not a consideration in determining whether or not to obtain a warranty for the technical data that pertain to the
item, component, or process. For example, a data warranty should be considered if the Government intends to repair
or maintain an item and defective repair or maintenance data would impair the Government's effective use of the item
or result in increased costs to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As prescribed in 246.710, use the clause at 252.246&hyph;7001, ``Warranty of Data'', and its alternates, or a
substantially similar clause when the Government needs a specific warranty of technical data.

Subcontractor rights in technical data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 10 U.S.C. 2320 provides subcontractors at all tiers the same protection for their rights in data as is provided
to prime contractors. The clauses at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'', and
252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions'', implement the statutory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 10 U.S.C. 2321 permits a subcontractor to transact directly with the Government matters relating to the validation
of its asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use or disclose technical data. The clause at 252.227&hyph;7037,
``Validation of Asserted Restrictions'' obtains a contractor's agreement that the direct transaction of validation
or challenge matters with subcontractors at any tier does not establish or imply privity of contract. When a subcontractor
or supplier exercises its right to transact validation matters directly with the Government, contracting officers
shall deal directly with such persons, as provided at 227.403&hyph;13(c)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Require prime contractors whose contracts include the following clauses to include those clauses, without modification
except for appropriate identification of the parties, in contracts with subcontractors or suppliers, at all tiers,
who will be furnishing technical data in response to a government requirement.

in lieu of the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'' when the Government
requires the unrestricted right to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose any technical data to be delivered
under the contract. Do not use the clause in contracts for Existing or Special Works.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7032 may be modified to accommodate the needs of a specific overseas procurement situation,

completion of the project under which the data were generated. Upon expiration of the 5 year restrictive license,
the Government has unlimited rights in the SBIR data. During the license period, the Government may not release or
disclose SBIR data to any person other than_

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

in any medium; sound recordings in any medium; musical, dramatic, and literary works; pantomimes and choreographic
works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; and, works of a similar nature. Usually, these or similar works
were not first created, developed, generated, originated, prepared, or produced under a Government contract. Therefore,
the Government must obtain a license in the work if it intends to reproduce the work, distribute copies of the work,
prepare derivative works, or perform or display the work publicly. When the Government is not responsible for the
content of an existing work, it should require the copyright owner to indemnify the Government for liabilities that
may arise out of the content, performance, use, or disclosure of such data.

has a specific need to control the distribution of works first produced, created, or generated in the performance
of a contract and required to be delivered under that contract, including controlling distribution by obtaining
an assignment of copyright, or a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the content,
performance, use, or disclosure of such works. Use the clause_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In lieu of the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'', when the Government
must own or control copyright in all works first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered under
a contract.

under a contract. The specific portion in which the Government must own or control copyright must be identified in
a special contract requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and unlimited rights in a special work under the clause
at 252.227&hyph;7020, the contractor retains use and disclosure rights in that work. If the Government needs to restrict
a contractor's rights to use or disclose a special work, it must also negotiate a special license which specifically
restricts the contractor's use or disclosure rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7020 does not permit a contractor to incorporate into a special work any works copyrighted

a non-exclusive, paid up, world-wide license to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works,
to perform or display publicly any portion of the work, and to permit others to do so for government purposes. Grant
permission only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party work is included in
the deliverable work.

. The Government obtains rights in computer software or computer software documentation, including a copyright
license, under an irrevocable license granted or obtained by the contractor which developed the software or documentation
or the licensor of the software or documentation if the development contractor is not the licensor. The contractor
or licensor retains all rights in the software or documentation not granted to the Government. The scope of a computer
software license is generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the software. Contractors or licensors
may, with some exceptions, restrict the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose computer software developed
exclusively or partially at private expense (see 227.503&hyph;5 (b) and (c)). They may not, without the Government's
agreement (see 227.503&hyph;5(d)) restrict the Government's rights in computer software developed exclusively
with Government funds or in computer software documentation required to be delivered under a contract.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The determination of the source of funds used to develop computer software should be made at the lowest practicable
segregable portion of the software or documentation (eg., a software sub-routine that performs a specific function).
Contractors may assert restricted rights in a segregable portion of computer software which otherwise qualifies
for restricted rights under the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial
Computer Software Documentation.''

The standard license rights in computer software that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government
purpose rights, or restricted rights. The standard license in computer software documentation conveys unlimited
rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014. In unusual situations, the standard rights
may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in return for other
consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide
the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights
provided in the standard grant of license. The situations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated
in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.

 The Government obtains an unlimited rights license in_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Computer software developed exclusively with government funds;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

by the government;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Computer software or computer software documentation that is otherwise publicly available or has been released
or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure other
than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to
another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Computer software or computer software documentation obtained with unlimited rights under another government
contract or as a result of negotiations; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Computer software or computer software documentation furnished to the government, under a government contract
or subcontract with_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Restricted rights in computer software, limited rights in technical data, or government purpose license rights
and the restrictive conditions have expired; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right to use such software or documentation for commercial
purposes has expired.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Government purpose rights.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Except as provided at 227.503&hyph;5(a), the Government obtains government purpose rights in computer software
developed with mixed funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable. The clause at 252.227&hyph;7014
provides a nominal five year period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the government purpose
rights period may be made at any time prior to delivery of the software without consideration from either party. Longer
periods should be negotiated when a five year period does not provide sufficient time to commercialize the software
form for software developed by subcontractors, when necessary to recognize the subcontractors' interests in the
software.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract
(or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required development of the
computer software. Upon expiration of the government purpose rights period, the Government has unlimited rights
in the software including the right to permit or authorize others to use the data for commercial purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, or authorize other persons to use, computer
software marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The Government shall not release
or disclose, or authorize others to release or disclose, computer software in which it has government purpose rights
to any person unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) The intended recipient is a government contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a Government
contract that contains the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, ``Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished
Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) When computer software marked with government purpose rights legends will be released or disclosed to a government
contractor performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, the contract may be modified,
prior to release or disclosure, to include such clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and non-disclosure
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that computer software or computer software documentation
marked with government purpose rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through
a government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and non-disclosure restrictions. Public announcements
in the Commerce Business Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure requirements.
Class use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g., agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company
within a reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government
purpose rights software or documentation. Documents transmitting government purpose rights software or documentation
to persons under class agreements shall identify the specific software or documentation subject to government purpose
rights and the class agreement under which such software or documentation are provided.

Restricted rights.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The Government obtains restricted rights in noncommercial computer software required to be delivered or otherwise
provided to the government under this contract that were developed exclusively at private expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Contractors are not required to provide the Government additional rights in computer software delivered or otherwise
provided to the Government with restricted rights. When the Government has a need for additional rights, the Government
must negotiate with the contractor to determine if there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. List
or describe all software in which the contractor has granted the Government additional rights in a license agreement
made part of the contract (see 227.503&hyph;5(d)). The license shall enumerate the specific additional rights granted
to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Specifically negotiated license rights.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the Government
or when the Government wants to obtain rights in computer software in which it does not have rights. When negotiating
to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in computer software, consider the planned software
maintenance philosophy, anticipated time or user sharing requirements, and other factors which may have relevance
for a particular procurement. If negotiating to relinquish rights in computer software documentation, consider
the administrative burden associated with protecting documentation subject to restrictions from unauthorized
release or disclosure. The negotiated license rights must stipulate the rights granted the Government to use, modify,
reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the software or documentation and the extent to which the Government
may authorize others to do so. Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract.

 The clause at 252.227&hyph;7014 protects the Government's rights in computer software, computer software documentation,
or portions thereof that the contractor subsequently uses to prepare derivative software or subsequently embeds
or includes in other software or documentation. The Government retains the rights it obtained under the development
contract in the unmodified portions of the derivative software or documentation.

(a)(1) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer
Software Documentation'' in solicitations and contracts when the successful offeror(s) will be required to deliver
computer software or computer software documentation. Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are technical
data (other than computer software documentation), commercial computer software of commercial computer software
documentation, commercial items (see 227.402&hyph;3), special works (see 277.505), contracts under the Small
Business Innovative Research Program (see 227.404), or in Architect-Engineer and construction contracts (see
227.407). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the work for sale on behalf of the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7019, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions_Computer Software'' in solicitations
and contracts that include the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014. The clause provides procedures for the validation of
asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose computer software. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions'', in solicitations and contracts
that include the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014 when the contractor will be required to deliver noncommercial computer
software documentation (technical data). The clause implements statutory requirements under 10 U.S.C. 2321. Paragraph
(d) of the clause contains information that must be included in a formal challenge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7016, ``Rights in Bid or Proposal Data'', in solicitations and contracts when
the Government anticipates a need to use, subsequent to contract award, computer software or computer software documentation
included in a bid or proposal that are not required to be delivered under the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7025, ``Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished Information
Marked with Restrictive Legends'', in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the Government will
provide the contractor, for performance of its contract, computer software or computer software documentation
marked with another contractor's restrictive legend(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Use the provision at 252.227&hyph;7028, ``Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government'',
in solicitations when the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver computer software or computer
software documentation. The provision requires offerors to identify any software or documentation specified in
the solicitation as deliverable items that are the same or substantially the same as software or documentation which
the offeror has delivered or is obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, under any other federal
agency contract.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7026, ``Deferred Delivery of Technical Data and Computer Software'', when it is in
the Government's interests to defer the delivery of computer software or computer software documentation. The clause
permits the contracting officer to require the delivery of data identified as ``deferred delivery'' data or computer
software at any time until two years after acceptance by the Government of all items (other than technical data or computer
software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers
to deliver such data expires two years after the date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor
or supplier for use in the performance of the contract. The contract must specify the computer software or computer
software documentation that is subject to deferred delivery. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor
sufficiently in advance of the desired delivery date for such software or documentation to permit timely delivery.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7027, ``Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software'', when a firm requirement
for software or documentation has not been established prior to contract award but there is a potential need for computer
software or computer software documentation. Under this clause, the contracting officer may order any computer
software or computer software documentation generated in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder
at any time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under
the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver such technical
data or computer software expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract.
When the software or documentation are ordered, the delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated
only for converting the software or documentation into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and delivery costs.

(1) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software
Documentation'', requires a contractor to grant, or obtain for the government license rights which permit the government
to reproduce the software or documentation, distribute copies, perform or display the software or documentation
and, through the right to modify data, prepare derivative works. The extent to which the government, and others acting
on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard data rights licenses obtained under the clause.
When non-standard license rights in computer software or computer software documentation will be negotiated, negotiate
the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not negotiate copyright
licenses for computer software that provide less rights than the standard restricted rights in computer software
license. For computer software documentation, do not negotiate a copyright license that provides less rights than
the standard limited rights in technical data license.

(2) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7013 does not permit a contractor to incorporate a third party's copyrighted software
into a deliverable software item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and,
when applicable, others acting on the Government's behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer's written approval
to do so. Grant approval to use third party copyrighted software in which the Government will not receive a copyright
license only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party material or when the
use of the third party material will result in cost savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright
license.

Identification requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The solicitation provision at 252.227&hyph;7017, ``Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure
Restrictions'', requires offerors to identify prior to contract award, any computer software or computer software
documentation that an offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification,
reproduction, release or disclosure. This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright.
The notification and identification must be submitted as an attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit
the Attachment or fails to complete the Attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision,
such failure shall constitute a minor informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality
in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.607. An offeror's failure to correct an informality within the
time prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted
restrictions or an offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the justification for an
asserted restriction or asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.503&hyph;13.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with
the procedures at 227.503&hyph;13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified. The contract
Attachment shall provide the same information regarding identification of the computer software or computer software
documentation, the asserted rights category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the
restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the solicitation provision. Subsequent to the contract award, the clause
at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation'',
permits a contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The additional assertions must be
made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor nor the fact that certain assertions are identified
in the Attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As provided at 227.503&hyph;13,
the Government has the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision may be used in the source selection
process to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government's ability
to use computer software or computer software documentation.

(1) A contractor who desires to restrict the Government's rights in computer software or computer software documentation
to place restrictive markings on the software or documentation, provides instructions for the placement of the restrictive
markings, and authorizes the use of certain restrictive markings. When it is anticipated that the software will or
may be used in combat or situations which simulate combat conditions, do not permit contractors to insert instructions
into computer programs that interfere with or delay operation of the software to display a restrictive rights legend
or other license notice.

(2) The contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide to the Government any computer software or computer
software documentation in which the Government has previously obtained rights with the Government's preexisting
rights in that software or documentation unless the parties have agreed otherwise or restrictions on the Government's
rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose the software or documentation have expired. When restrictions
are still applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the software or documentation with the appropriate restrictive

(1) Computer software or computer software documentation delivered or otherwise provided under a contract without
restrictive markings shall be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be released or disclosed
without restriction. To the extent practicable, if a contractor has requested permission (see 227.503&hyph;10(c)(2))
to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, do not release or disclose the software or documentation pending

officer. The person making the request must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Identify the software or documentation that should have been marked; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the proposed marking is justified and conforms
with the requirements for the marking of computer software or computer software documentation contained in the ``Rights

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software
Documentation'' requires a contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver computer software
or computer software documentation with other than unlimited rights, to establish and follow written procedures
to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain records to justify the validity
of restrictive markings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7019, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions_Computer Software'', requires contractors
and their subcontractors or suppliers at any tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of markings
that assert restrictions on the use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure
of computer software. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
227.503&hyph;12 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Government right to establish conformity of markings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nonconforming markings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Authorized markings are identified in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer
Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation.'' All other markings are nonconforming markings.
An authorized marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the clause
at 252.227&hyph;7014 is also a nonconforming marking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The correction of nonconforming markings on computer software is not subject to 252.227&hyph;7019, ``Validation
of Asserted Restrictions_Computer Software'' and the correction of non-conforming markings on computer software
documentation (technical data) is not subject to 252.227&hyph;7037, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions''.
To the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return computer software or computer software documentation
bearing nonconforming markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on the software or documentation
to provide that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming markings at that person's expense. If
that person fails to correct the nonconformity and return the corrected software or documentation within 60 days
following the person's receipt of the software or documentation, the contracting officer may correct or strike the
nonconformity at that person's expense. When it is impracticable to return computer software or computer software
documentation for correction, contracting officers may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government
expense. Prior to correction, the software or documentation may be used in accordance with the proper restrictive
marking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unjustified markings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) An unjustified marking is an authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions applicable to the
Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, or disclosure of the marked computer software or computer
software documentation. For example, a restricted rights legend placed on computer software developed under a Government
contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations under which the Government
obtains unlimited or government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the validity of unjustified markings. However, at
any time during performance of a contract and notwithstanding the existence of a formal challenge, the contracting
officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified.
Upon such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, either_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's expense; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Return the computer software or computer software documentation to the person asserting the restriction for
correction at that person's expense. If the software or documentation are returned and that person fails to correct
or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected software or documentation to the contracting officer
within sixty (60) days following receipt of the software or documentation, the unjustified marking shall be corrected
or stricken at that person's expense.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An offeror's or contractor's assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce,
release, or disclose computer software or computer software documentation do not, by themselves, determine the
extent of the Government's rights in such software or documentation. The Government may require an offeror or contractor
to submit sufficient information to permit an evaluation of a particular asserted restriction and may challenge
asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to believe that an assertion is not valid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requests for information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Contracting officers should have a reason to suspect that an asserted restriction might not be correct prior to requesting
information. When requesting information, provide the offeror or contractor the reason(s) for suspecting that
an asserted restriction might not be correct. A need for additional license rights is not, by itself, a sufficient
basis for requesting information concerning an asserted restriction. Follow the procedures at 227.503&hyph;5(d)
when additional license rights are needed but there is no basis to suspect that an asserted restriction right not be
valid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transacting matters directly with subcontractors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The clause at 252.227&hyph;7019 obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact matters under
the clause directly with a subcontractor or supplier at any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract.
Contracting officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge and validation matters directly
with the Government when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its technical data would be compromised if the data were
disclosed to a higher tier contractor; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely
response would jeopardize a subcontractor's or supplier's right to assert restrictions; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pre-award considerations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The challenge procedures in the clause at 252.227&hyph;7019, ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions_Computer
Software'' could significantly delay competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions
prior to a competitive contract award unless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful completion
of the procurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Computer software documentation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Computer software documentation is technical data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Challenges to asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display,
or disclose computer software documentation must be made in accordance with the ``Validation of Asserted Restrictions''
clause, 252.227&hyph;7037, and the guidance at 227.403&hyph;13. The procedures in that clause implement requirements
contained in 10 U.S.C. 2321. Resolution of questions regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process
described at 227.403&hyph;12(b)(2) is strongly encouraged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Computer software.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Asserted restrictions should be reviewed before acceptance of the computer software deliverable under a contract.
The Government's right to challenge an assertion expires 3 years after final payment under the contract or three years
after delivery of the software, whichever is later. Those limitations on the Government's challenge rights do not
apply to software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been
otherwise made available without restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Contracting officers must have reasonable grounds to challenge the current validity of an asserted restriction.
Before challenging an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining to the asserted
restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resolution of questions regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process described at 227.503&hyph;12(b)(2)
is strongly encouraged. After consideration of the situations described in 227.503&hyph;13(c), contracting officers
may request the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation
for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to determine the validity of the assertion.
Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by that person does not, in the
contracting officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Extension of response time.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a challenge, as appropriate,
if the contractor submits a timely written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Validating or denying asserted restrictions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Contracting officers must promptly issue a final decision denying or sustaining the validity of each challenged
assertion unless the parties have agreed on the disposition of the assertion. When a final decision denying the validity
of an asserted restriction is made following a timely response to a challenge, the Government is obligated to continue
to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the Agency Head notifies the
person asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue
to respect the asserted restriction. See 252.227&hyph;7019(g) for restrictions applicable following a determination
of urgent and compelling circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Only a contracting officer's final decision, or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent
jurisdiction, that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the contracting officer who made the
earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall
consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify that all challenges apply to the same asserted
restriction and, after consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the restriction,
issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable opportunity to respond to each challenge.

 Solicitations and contracts requiring the delivery of computer software shall specify the requirements the software

determining whether computer software tendered for acceptance conforms to the contractual requirements. Except
for nonconforming restrictive markings (follow the procedures at 227.503&hyph;12(a) if nonconforming markings
are the sole reason computer software tendered for acceptance fails to conform to contractual requirements), do
not accept software that does not conform in all respects to applicable contractual requirements. Correction or
replacement of nonconforming software, or an equitable reduction in contract price when correction or replacement
of the nonconforming data is not practicable or is not in the Government's interests, shall be accomplished in accordance
with_

The specific software or documentation in which the Government must own or control copyright must be identified in
a special contract requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and unlimited rights in the computer software or computer
software documentation delivered as a special work under the clause at 252.227&hyph;7020, the contractor retains
use and disclosure rights in that software or documentation. If the Government needs to restrict a contractor's rights
to use or disclose the information contained in a special work, it must also negotiate a special license which specifically
restricts the contractor's use or disclosure rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7020 does not permit a contractor to incorporate into a special work any work copyrighted

a non-exclusive, paid up, world-wide license to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works,
to perform or display any portion of that work, and to permit others to do so for government purposes. Grant permission
only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party work is included in the deliverable
work.

(d) Examples of other works which may be procured under this clause include, but are not limited to, audiovisual works,
scripts, soundtracks, musical compositions, and adaptations; histories of departments, agencies, services or
units thereof; surveys of Government establishments; instructional works or guidance to Government officers and
employees on the discharge of their official duties; reports, books, studies, surveys or similar documents; collections
of data containing information pertaining to individuals that, if disclosed, would violate the right of privacy
or publicity of the individuals to whom the information relates; or, investigative reports.

that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability
depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered ``developed'',
the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market,
nor must the item, component or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United
States Code.

Limitation on charges for rights in technical data.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including, but not limited to, license fees, royalties,
or similar changes, for rights in technical data to be delivered under this contract when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the data; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1)_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the contractor to acquire
rights in subcontractor or supplier technical data, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights
under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which
the technical data will be delivered.

 (1) The contractor shall ensure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10
U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes of paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized
and protected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whenever any technical data is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under
this contract, the contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and
require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. No other clause
shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's
rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next
higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract
for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor
or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such data directly to the Government, rather than through a
higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers will not use their power to award contracts as economic
leverage to obtain rights in technical data from their subcontractors or suppliers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In no event shall the contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights
in technical data as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend
to all technical data and computer software that qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed
on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed material containing
technical data or computer software for which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of a page of printed material
are subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note,
or other appropriate identifier. Instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in
order to display a restrictive legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer software
shall not be inserted in the software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, unless the contracting officer's
written permission to deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproduction of technical data,
computer software, or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.

rights in subcontractor or supplier technical data or computer software, if the subcontractor or supplier has been
paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government;

No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's
or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data or computer software.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next
higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract
for technical data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said
subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical data directly to the Government,
rather than through a higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic
leverage to obtain rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) In no event shall the contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights
in technical data or computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.

 The Contractor shall maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any markings that assert restrictions
on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose computer software
delivered or required to be delivered under this contract and shall be prepared to furnish to the contracting officer
a written justification for such restrictive markings in response to a request for information under paragraph (d)
or a challenge under paragraph (f) of this clause.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Contractor agrees that the contracting officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors
or suppliers at any tier who assert restrictions on the Government's right to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform,
display, or disclose computer software. Neither this clause, nor any action taken by the Government under this clause,
creates or implies privity of contract between the Government and the Contractor's subcontractors or suppliers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The contracting officer may request the Contractor to provide sufficient information to enable the contracting
officer to evaluate the Contractor's asserted restrictions. Such information shall be based upon the records required
by this clause or other information reasonably available to the Contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Based upon the information provided, if the_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Contractor agrees that an asserted restriction is not valid, the contracting officer may_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at the Contractor's expense; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Return the computer software to the Contractor for correction at the Contractor's expense. If the Contractor
fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected software to the contracting officer
within sixty (60) days following receipt of the software the contracting officer may correct or strike the markings
at that Contractor's expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Contracting officer concludes that the asserted restriction is appropriate for this contract, he or she shall
so notify the Contractor in writing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Contractor's failure to provide a timely response to a contracting officer's request for information or failure
to provide sufficient information to enable the contracting officer to evaluate an asserted restriction shall constitute
reasonable grounds for questioning the validity of an asserted restriction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Government right to challenge and validate asserted restrictions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The Government, when there are reasonable grounds to do so, has the right to review and challenge the validity of
any restrictions asserted by the Contractor on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform,
display, or disclose computer software delivered, to be delivered under this contract, or otherwise provided to
the Government in the performance of this contract. Except for software that is publicly available, has been furnished
to the Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available without restrictions, the Government
may exercise this right only within three years after the date(s) the software is delivered or otherwise furnished
to the Government, or three years following final payment under this contract, whichever is later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The absence of a challenge to an asserted restriction shall not constitute validation under this clause. Only
a contracting officer's final decision or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction
that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction.

(iii) Require the Contractor to provide justification for the assertion based upon records kept in accordance with
paragraph (b) of this clause and such other documentation that are reasonably available to the Contractor, in sufficient
detail to enable the contracting officer to determine the validity of the asserted restrictions; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) State that a contracting officer's final decision, during the three year period preceding this challenge, or
action of a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals that sustained the validity of an identical
assertion made by the Contractor (or a licensee) shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The contracting officer shall extend the time for response if the Contractor submits a written request showing
the need for additional time to prepare a response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The contracting officer may request additional supporting documentation if, in his or her opinion, the Contractor's
explanation does not provide sufficient evidence to justify the validity of the asserted restrictions. The Contractor
agrees to promptly respond to the contracting officer's request for additional supporting documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Notwithstanding challenge by the contracting officer, the parties may agree on the disposition of an asserted
restriction at any time prior to a contracting officer's final decision or, if the Contractor has appealed that decision,
filed suit, or provided notice of an intent to file suit, at any time prior to a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction
or Board of Contract Appeals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If the Contractor fails to respond to the contracting officer's request for information or additional information
under subparagraph (f)(1) of this clause, the contracting officer shall issue a final decision, in accordance with
the ``Disputes'' clause of this contract, pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If the contracting officer, after reviewing the written explanation furnished pursuant to subparagraph (f)(1)
of this clause, or any other available information pertaining to the validity of an asserted restriction, determines
that the asserted restriction has_

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Not been justified, the contracting officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the ``Disputes''
clause of this contract, denying the validity of the asserted restriction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Been justified, the contracting officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the ``Disputes''
clause of this contract, validating the asserted restriction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) A contractor receiving challenges to the same asserted restriction(s) from more than one contracting officer
shall notify each contracting officer of the other challenges. The notice shall also state which contracting officer
initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The contracting officer who initiated the first in time unanswered
challenge, after consultation with the other contracting officers who have challenged the restrictions and the
contractor, shall formulate and distribute a schedule that provides the contractor a reasonable opportunity for
responding to each challenge.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Government agrees that, notwithstanding a contracting officer's final decision denying the validity of
an asserted restriction and except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this clause, it will honor the asserted restriction_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the contracting officer's final decision to allow the Contractor

(ii) For a period of one year from the date of the contracting officer's final decision if, within the first ninety (90)
days following the contracting officer's final decision, the Contractor has provided notice of an intent to file
suit in an appropriate court; or,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Until final disposition by the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or court of competent jurisdiction, if
the Contractor has: (A) appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals or filed suit in an appropriate court within ninety

suite within one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Contractor agrees that the Government may strike, correct, or ignore the restrictive markings if the Contractor
fails to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(iii) File suit within one year after the date of the contracting officer's final decision if the Contractor had provided
notice of intent to file suit within ninety (90) days following the date of the contracting officer's final decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The agency head, on a non-delegable basis, may determine that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit
awaiting the filing of suit in an appropriate court, or the rendering of a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction
or Board of Contract Appeals. In that event, the agency head shall notify the Contractor of the urgent or compelling
circumstances. Notwithstanding subparagraph (g)(1) of this clause, the Contractor agrees that the agency may use,
modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software marked with (i) government purpose
legends for any purpose, and authorize others to do so; or, (ii) restricted or special license rights for government
purposes only. The Government agrees not to release or disclose such software unless prior to release or disclosure,
the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.403&hyph;7; or, is a government
contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at
252.227&hyph;7025, ``Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive
Legends.'' The agency head's determination may be made at any time after the date of the contracting officer's final
decision and shall not affect the Contractor's right to damages against the United States, or other relief provided
by law, if its asserted restrictions are ultimately upheld.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of draft modifications
to the Recovery Implementation Program Recovery Action Plan (RIPRAP) dated October 15, 1993. The RIPRAP identifies
specific actions and timeframes currently believed to be necessary to recover the endangered fish in the most expeditious
manner possible in the Upper Colorado River Basin (Upper Basin). The Upper Basin is defined as the Colorado River drainage
upstream of Lake Powell, with the exception of the San Juan River drainage. The RIPRAP will serve as a measure of accomplishment
so the Recovery Program can continue to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative to avoid the likelihood of
jeopardy to the continued existence of the endangered fish for projects undergoing section 7 consultations. Critical
habitat for the endangered fish was formally designated on April 20, 1994. The Recovery Program is also intended to
serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative to avoid the likely destruction or adverse modification of critical
habitat. Therefore, modifications to the RIPRAP are being proposed so the Recovery Program can serve as the reasonable
and prudent alternative to avoid adverse modification to critical habitat as well as to avoid the likelihood of jeopardy
resulting from depletion impacts of new projects and all existing or past impacts related to historic water projects
with the exception of the discharge by historic projects of pollutants such as trace elements, heavy metals, and pesticides.
The proposed modifications were developed by FWS in coordination with the Recovery Program's Management Committee.
The Service solicits review and comment from the public on the draft changes to the RIPRAP.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Four native fish species that inhabit the Colorado River Basin are federally listed as endangered: the Colorado sqawfish
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ptychocheilus lucius
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), humpback chub (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Gila cypha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), bonytail (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Gila elegans
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and razorback sucker (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Xyrauchen texanus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Each of these four species was once abundant in the Upper Basin; however, they have declined in numbers and are now
threatened with extinction from their natural habitat. Factors accounting for the current status of these species
include direct loss of habitat, changes in water flow and temperature regimes, blockage of migration routes, and
interactions with introduced (nonnative) fish species. The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has maintained
since 1978 that a jeopardy situation exists in the upper Colorado River basin and that actions must be taken to reverse
the decline of endangered fish populations and habitat. The Service has described this conclusion through section
7 of the Endangered Species Act (Act) in over 224 biological opinions on project impacts on the endangered fish in the
Upper Basin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1988, the Governors of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Administrator of the
Western Area Power Administration entered into a cooperative agreement to implement the Recovery Implementation
Program for Endangered Fish Species in the Upper Colorado River Basin (Recovery Program). The purpose of the Recovery
Program is to recover the four endangered fish in the Upper Colorado River Basin while providing for future water development
to proceed in compliance with the Endangered Species Act, Interstate Compacts, and State law. Participants in the
Recovery Program include the Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the States of Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado, the Western
Area Power Administration (Western), and representatives of the water development interests and conservation
groups. The Colorado River Energy Distributors Association is a nonvoting member of the Recovery Program. The ultimate
goal of the Recovery Program is to recover and delist the endangered fishes in the Upper Basin by restoring and establishing
self-sustaining populations and protecting sufficient habitat to support these populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Recovery Program also outlines procedures for section 7 consultations. the Service raised an issue with the Recovery
Program participants as to whether progress toward recovery of the fish has been sufficient to allow for the continued
issuance of favorable biological opinions. Discussions among the Recovery Program participants resulted in an
agreement, which was finalized on October 15, 1993, that clarified how section 7 consultations would be conducted
on depletion impacts related to new projects and impacts associated with historic projects (existing projects requiring
a new Federal action) in the Upper Basin. The Recovery Implementation Program Recovery Action Plan (RIPRAP) was developed
by the Recovery Program participants using the best information available and the recovery goals established for
the four endangered fish species. It identifies specific actions and timeframes currently believed to be required
to recover the endangered fish in the most expeditious manner possible in the Upper Basin. The RIPRAP also serves as
a measure of accomplishment so the Recovery Program can continue to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative
to avoid the likelihood of jeopardy to the continued existence of the endangered fishes for projects undergoing section
7 consultations. The Service also intends that the Recovery Program will serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative
which avoids the likely destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. The final rule determining critical
habitat for the endangered fishes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 21, 1994, and the final designation became effective on April 20, 1994. The proposed changes continued in
the modified RIPRAP are designed to fulfill such intent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as a direct or indirect alternation
that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species.
Section 7 consultation is initiated by a Federal Agency when its action may affect critical habitat by impacting any
of the primary constituent elements or reduce the potential of critical habitat to develop those elements. The Primary
constituent elements determined necessary for survival and recovery of the four Colorado River endangered fishes
include, but are not limited to, water, physical habitat, and biological environment as defined in the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the specific actions in the existing RIPRAP not only contribute to allowing the Recovery Program to continue
to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative to avoid the likelihood of jeopardy to the continued existence
of the endangered fishes, but also will avoid the likely destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat
for the endangered fishes. Therefore, the proposed additions and changes to the RIPRAP which the Service believes
are necessary for the Recovery Program to continue to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative for projects
undergoing section 7 consultations are not extensive. The proposed modifications are primarily intended to provide
further definition to already identified recovery actions in the RIPRAP and to provide increased certainty that
the Recovery Program can continue to serve as the reasonable and prudent alternative for projects subject to section
7 consultations.

A programmatic Environmental Assessment was completed on the Recovery Program in November 1987. The Environmental
Assessment provides an analysis and assessment of the impacts to the environment from Recovery Program implementation.
The October 1993 Agreement and RIPRAP, including the proposed changes, identify in more detail how the Recovery Program
will be carried out. Appropriate site specific NEPA compliance will be conducted on specific actions identified
in the RIPRAP.

 NMFS will hold four public hearings to receive comments from fishery participants and other members of the public
regarding proposed amendments to regulations governing the Atlantic tuna fisheries. The proposed amendments would
require: A Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document as a condition to import, export, or re-export fresh or frozen bluefin
tuna shipments into or from the United States by bluefin tuna dealers; a Federal permit for all dealers that purchase
or receive Pacific bluefin tuna for export; and a bi-weekly report and tagging requirement for Pacific bluefin tuna
dealers that export fish.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend the regulations of the Department of Justice (Department) implementing titles II
and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to incorporate, as the ADA Standards for Accessible Design, the
ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities as they are revised in the interim rule with request for
comments being published by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. In so doing, the proposed rule would establish new ADA standards for construction and alterations covered by the
Department's title II regulations. (The guidelines set forth in the Access Board's interim rule are effective only
as guidance for the Departments of Justice and Transportation; they have no effect on the public and should not be used
by the public until such time as the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation adopt them as standards.)
The proposed rule would also add new enforcement procedures to subpart F of the title II regulation.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 26, 1991, the Department published its final rules implementing titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities
Act, Pub. L. 101&hyph;336, 42 U.S.C. 12131&hyph;12134 and 12181&hyph;12189, which prohibits discrimination on
the basis of disability by public entities and in places of public accommodation and commercial facilities. 56 FR
35694, 35544. The Department's implementing regulations were codified at 28 CFR, parts 35 and 36. Subtitle A of title
II of the ADA protects qualified individuals with disabilities from discrimination on the basis of disability in
the services, programs, or activities of all state and local governments. It extends the prohibition of discrimination
in federally assisted programs established by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794, to all
activities of state and local governments, including those that do not receive federal financial assistance, and
incorporates specific prohibitions of discrimination on the basis of disability from titles I, III, and V of the ADA.
Title III of the ADA protects qualified individuals with disabilities from discrimination on the basis of disability
by public accommodations and in commercial facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This proposed rule would amend 28 CFR 35.151 and 36.406 to adopt the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and
Facilities (ADAAG), as revised by the Access Board in their interim rule that is published elsewhere in this issue
of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as the ADA Standards for Accessible Design (ADA Standards) for new construction and alterations covered by the Department's
title II regulation. The ADA Standards would apply to facilities designed, constructed, or altered after the effective
date of the amendment to &sect;35.151. The proposed rule would also remove the original ADA Standards for Accessible
Design, 28 CFR part 36, Appendix A; add the ADA Standards, as amended by the Access Board's interim rule, as Appendix
A to part 37; and amend parts 35 and 36 to correctly reference the redesignated ADA Standards. Finally, the proposed
rule would amend the Compliance Procedures in subpart F of part 35 to incorporate procedures used under agency regulations
implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for federally assisted programs and activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 504 of the ADA requires the Access Board to issue supplemental Minimum Guidelines and Requirements for Accessible
Design of buildings and facilities subject to the ADA, including titles II and III. Sections 204(c) and 306(c) of the
ADA provide that the Attorney General shall promulgate regulations implementing titles II and III that are consistent
with the Access Board's ADA guidelines. In issuing its final title II regulation, the Department explained that it
intended to amend the regulation to adopt the new accessibility standards for title II after the Access Board had amended
its ADA Accessibility Guidelines to include specific requirements applicable to buildings and facilities operated
by entities subject to title II. The Access Board is now publishing its interim guidelines for title II elsewhere in
this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and this proposed rule would adopt those guidelines. Rather than having the ADA Standards for Accessible Design
published twice, as an appendix to both parts 35 and 36, this proposed rule would adopt the revised ADA Standards as
Appendix A to part 37. Parts 35 and 36 are amended to reference those standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Access Board received public comments on its proposed guidelines, published on December 21, 1992, and is soliciting
comments on its interim rule, which is published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Department, as a member of the Access Board, will be actively involved in the review and analysis of the comments
that the Access Board receives on its interim guidelines and in making any revisions to the guidelines in response
to those comments. Therefore, the Department has proposed to adopt the guidelines, as revised by the Access Board
in its final rule, as the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. Comments submitted to the Access Board in response either
to its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking or its Interim Rule, therefore, will also be considered by the Department as comments
on this proposed rule, and need not be separately submitted to the Department. Comments previously received by the
Access Board concerning provision of unisex restrooms will be considered by the Department of Justice through future
rulemaking or other action.

28 CFR 35.151 would be replaced by &sect;&sect;35.151&hyph;35.155 of the proposed regulation. At present, &sect;35.151
provides that those buildings that are constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity shall
be designed, constructed, or altered to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Current
&sect;35.151(c) establishes two standards for accessible new construction and alteration. Under paragraph (c),
design, construction, or alteration of facilities in conformance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards
(UFAS) or with the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG)
is deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to those facilities (except that, if ADAAG is
chosen, the elevator exemption does not apply). ADAAG was initially developed by the Access Board as a guideline for
accessibility to buildings and facilities that are subject to title III. It was adopted by the Department as the standard
for places of public accommodation and commercial facilities under title III of the ADA and was published as Appendix
A to the Department's regulation implementing title III, 28 CFR part 36, and amended on January 18, 1994, 59 FR 2674.
This rule removes that appendix and adds the Access Board's revised guidelines as Appendix A to 28 CFR part 37. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would revise 28 CFR 35.151 and add four new sections, 28 CFR 35.152&hyph;35.155, which follow the
format of parallel provisions in the Department's title III regulation at 28 CFR part 36, subpart D.

Section 35.150&blank;Existing Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would amend &sect;35.150(a)(2), which provides that, in ensuring access to programs in existing
facilities, a public entity is not required to take any action that would threaten or destroy the historic significance
of an historic property. The proposed amendment to &sect;35.150(a)(2) would incorporate the procedures set out
in section 4.1.7 of the ADA Standards for determining whether a physical alteration would threaten or destroy the
historic significance of an historic property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also amend &sect;35.150(b)(1) to make clear that the path of travel requirements of &sect;35.153
do not apply to measures taken solely to comply with program accessibility requirements. This amendment is consistent
with &sect;36.304(d)(1) of the title III regulation, which states that ``[t]he path of travel requirements of &sect;36.403
shall not apply to measures taken solely to comply with the barrier removal requirements of this section.''

Section 35.151&blank;New Construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 35.151, as revised, would require that newly constructed facilities be readily accessible to and usable
by individuals with disabilities. Paragraph 35.151(b)(2) of the proposed rule incorporates the ADA's ``structural
impracticability'' exception for new construction. Under that exception, in new construction, full compliance
with the requirements of the ADA Standards is not required where a public entity can demonstrate that it is structurally
impracticable to meet the requirements. However, full compliance will be considered structurally impracticable
only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility
features. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute dictates that regulations promulgated under title II of the ADA ``shall be consistent with [the other
titles of] this Act'' as well as with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;336, &sect;204(b).
Furthermore, the legislative history of the ADA indicates that ``the forms of discrimination prohibited by [title
II are] identical to those set out in the applicable provisions of titles I and III.'' H.R. Rep. No. 485, 101st Cong.,
2d Sess., pt. 2, at 84 (1990). Thus the structural impracticability exception for public accommodations and commercial
facilities contained in the Department of Justice title III regulations at 28 CFR 36.401(c) has been incorporated
in &sect;35.151 and is included in the ADA Standards at &sect;4.1.1(5)(a). Other revisions to this rule and to the
ADA Standards that render this rule and the ADA Standards consistent with title III, which are discussed below, are
based on this same statutory mandate and legislative history.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the legislative history of the ADA, the Department's proposed rule states that the structural impracticability
exception will apply only in rare and unusual circumstances where unique characteristics of terrain make accessibility
unusually difficult. This exception is the same as the exception in the Department's title III regulation, 28 CFR

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36.401(c), and is narrower than the exception in the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Fair Housing Accessibility
Guidelines (56 FR 9472 (1991)), which generally would allow exceptions from accessibility requirements, or allow
compliance with less stringent requirements, on sites with slopes exceeding 10%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limited structural impracticability exception adopted by the proposed rule would allow deviations from accessibility
requirements only where unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features
or where providing accessibility would destroy the physical integrity of a facility. A situation in which a building
must be built on stilts because of its location in marshlands or over water is an example of one of the few situations
in which the exception for structural impracticability would apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, if full compliance with the accessibility standards would be structurally impracticable, compliance
is required to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. Any portion of the facility that can be made accessible
must be made accessible to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. In addition, if providing accessibility
to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable,
accessibility must nonetheless be ensured to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches
or who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in accordance with this section.

Section 35.152&blank;Alterations: General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New &sect;35.152 of the proposed rule establishes the requirements for alterations. It includes a definition of
``alteration'' based on the Department's title III regulation. The term ``resurfacing'' is added to this definition
to be consistent with the Access Board's proposed change to the definition of alteration in ADAAG &sect;3.5. It also
adds a definition of the phrase ``to the maximum extent feasible,'' as used in &sect;35.152(a), which requires that
alterations be done, to the maximum extent feasible, in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is accessible.
That proposed definition is taken from the Department's title III regulation, 28 CFR 36.402(c), and provides that
the phrase applies to the occasional case where the nature of an existing facility makes it virtually impossible to
comply fully with applicable accessibility standards through a planned alteration. In the occasional cases in which
full compliance is impossible, alterations shall provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible. Like the
structural impracticability exception for new construction, it requires that the facility be made accessible to
persons with other types of disabilities even if providing accessibility for individuals who use wheelchairs would
not be feasible.

Section 35.153&blank;Alterations: Path of Travel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;35.153, Alterations: Path of Travel, is also based on the title III regulation. UFAS and ADAAG both
contain requirements for provision of an accessible ``path of travel'' to the altered area when an existing facility
is altered, although the circumstances that trigger the requirements are somewhat different under each statute.
Under &sect;4.1.6(3) of UFAS, an accessible route to the altered area, an accessible entrance, and (where applicable)
accessible toilet facilities must be provided when a substantial alteration is made to an existing building. An alteration
is considered ``substantial'' if the total cost of all alterations within any twelve-month period amounts to 50%
or more of the full and fair cash value of the building. The proposed rule eliminates the UFAS ``substantial alteration''
basis for path of travel requirements because it eliminates UFAS as an option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The path of travel requirements of proposed &sect;35.153 are based on section 303(a)(2) of the ADA, which provides
that, when an entity undertakes an alteration to a place of public accommodation or commercial facility that affects
or could affect the usability of or access to an area that contains a primary function, the entity shall ensure that,
to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area, and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking
fountains serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including
individuals who use wheelchairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1) of proposed &sect;35.153 provides that areas such as mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage
rooms, employee lounges and locker rooms, janitorial closets, entrances, and corridors are not areas containing
a primary function. Nor are restrooms areas containing a primary function unless the provision of restrooms is the
major reason that the facility is maintained by a public entity, such as at a highway rest stop. In that situation, a
restroom would be considered to be an ``area containing a primary function'' of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement for an accessible path of travel does not apply, however, to the extent that the cost and scope of alterations
to the path of travel is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, as determined under criteria established
by the Attorney General. Sections 227 and 242 of the ADA adopt the same requirement for public transportation facilities
under title II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4.1.6(2) of the ADA Standards, which is not modified by the Access Board's proposed amendments, adopts the
statutory path of travel requirement, and &sect;36.403 of the Department's title III regulation establishes the
criteria for determining when the cost of alterations to the path of travel are ``disproportionate'' to the cost of
the overall alteration. The proposed rule would add a new &sect;35.153(d) to adopt the same disproportionality criteria
for facilities altered by public entities as are applied to private entities under title III. Alterations made to
provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area would be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration
when the cost exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As originally published, the ADA Standards consisted of nine main sections and a separate appendix. Sections 1 through
3 contain general provisions and definitions. Section 4 contains scoping provisions and technical specifications
applicable to all covered buildings and facilities. Sections 5 through 9 are special application sections and contain
additional requirements for restaurants and cafeterias, medical care facilities, business and mercantile facilities,
libraries, and transient lodging. Section 10, which established requirements for transportation facilities,
was added on January 18, 1994 (59 FR 2674). The appendix to the ADA Standards contains additional information to aid
in understanding the technical specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is now proposing to supplement the original ADA Standards by adding specific requirements applicable
to public entities. These requirements are set out in sections 11 through 14 of the Access Board's interim guidelines,
which are special application sections for facilities covered by title II. Section 11 would apply to Judicial, Legislative,
and Regulatory Facilities; section 12 to Detention and Correctional Facilities; section 13 to Accessible Residential
Housing subject to title II; and section 14 to Public Rights-of-Way. The Department's proposed rule would also amend
certain general requirements of the ADA Standards to clarify application to facilities covered by title II. (It would,
for example, clarify that the elevator exemption applies to places of public accommodation and commercial facilities,
but not to facilities covered by title II.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 35.151 of the current regulation applies to design, construction, and alteration of facilities if the construction
was commenced after the effective date of the regulation, January 26, 1992. Facilities under design for new construction
on that date were governed by that section if the date that bids were invited fell after the effective date. Alterations
were deemed to have commenced after January 26, 1992, if the physical alteration of the property began after that date.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;35.151, which provides that public entities could use either UFAS or ADAAG as the accessibility
standard, would be replaced by &sect;35.155, which adopts the ADA Standards (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Access Board's ADAAG as revised in the interim rule) as the applicable standard, as of the effective date of the
amendment. Consistent with federal practice under section 504, the new standard to be adopted by this proposed amendment
would not be applied retroactively. Facilities that were designed, constructed, or altered in conformance with
the requirements of &sect;35.151 prior to the effective date of this proposed amendment would not be required to be
retrofitted to conform to the new standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, newly constructed or altered facilities would continue to be covered by either UFAS or ADAAG if the construction
or alteration commenced between January 26, 1992, and the effective date of the proposed amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;35.155 could create a potential conflict between the revised regulation and the existing agency
regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for federally assisted programs. These section
504 regulations require that newly constructed or altered facilities be readily accessible to and usable by individuals
with disabilities and provide that facilities designed, constructed, or altered in conformance with UFAS shall
be deemed to comply with that requirement. Public entities that receive federal financial assistance, therefore,
would be required by this regulation to follow the ADA Standards, while, under section 504, they could also be required
to follow UFAS. This overlap between the requirements of title II of the ADA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
was one of the reasons that the current regulation allows public entities the option of using either UFAS or ADAAG.
Pursuant to its authority under Executive Order 12,250 for coordination of implementation and enforcement of section
504, therefore, the Department has advised the federal agencies that have regulations implementing section 504
for their federally assisted programs that facilities designed, constructed, or altered by a public entity in conformance
with the proposed ADAAG should be deemed to comply with the requirements for new construction and alterations of any
regulation implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act that applies to that public entity. Private entities
that receive federal financial assistance would continue to be governed by the standards in any applicable regulation
implementing section 504. It is expected that, when ADA Standards proposed in this rule are finalized, the agencies
with enforcement responsibilities under section 504 will amend their regulations to adopt the ADA Standards as the
standard for new construction and alterations. In the interim, the agencies that enforce section 504 should not require
public entities to conform to both UFAS and ADAAG.

Enforcement Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart F of the current regulation establishes administrative procedures for enforcement of title II of the ADA.
Section 203 of the ADA adopts the ``remedies, procedures, and rights'' provided in section 505 of the Rehabilitation
Act, 29 U.S.C. 794a, as the enforcement procedures for title II. Section 505, in turn, incorporates by reference the
remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d to 2000d&hyph;4a).
Section 204 of the ADA, which requires the Department to issue regulations to implement subtitle A of title II, requires
that the regulations be consistent with the section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs
and activities at 28 CFR Part 41. The House Committee on Education and Labor explained that it expected the Attorney
General to use the section 504 enforcement procedures as the model for title II enforcement. H.R. Rep. No. 485, 101st
Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, at 98 (1990).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by sections 203 and 204(b) of the ADA, the proposed enforcement procedures are the procedures for enforcement
of section 504, which, in turn, adopt the enforcement procedures for title VI. Title VI, which prohibits discrimination
on the basis of race, color, or national origin in federally assisted programs and activities, is enforced by the federal
agencies that provide the federal financial assistance to the covered programs and activities in question. If voluntary
compliance cannot be achieved, federal agencies enforce title VI either by the termination of federal funds to a program
or activity that is found to discriminate, following an administrative hearing, or by a referral to the Department
of Justice for judicial enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title II of the ADA extended the requirements of section 504 to all services, programs, and activities of state and
local governments, not only those that receive federal financial assistance. Subpart F of the Department's original
regulation establishes basic procedures to be followed by the agencies designated in subpart G for processing complaints
against state and local government entities when the designated agency does not have jurisdiction under section
504. As required by section 204(b) of the ADA, these procedures are consistent with the Department's coordination
regulation for section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 28 CFR 41.5(a)(1), which directs agencies to adopt the enforcement
procedures of their title VI regulations for enforcement of section 504. Although section 203 of the ADA mandates
that the title II procedures be the same as the section 504 procedures, the final rule did not detail procedures for
investigations other than those based on individual complaints. Nor did it include requirements for cooperation
by public entities in investigations, as required under title VI. This proposed rule would clarify &sect;&sect;35.172
and 35.174 of subpart F by specifically incorporating the language of the regulations implementing title VI and section
504 for federally assisted programs with respect to those provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 35.172 of the Department's current regulation requires designated agencies to investigate all complete
complaints for which they were responsible as determined under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;35.171. It requires the designated agency to issue a Letter of Findings at the conclusion of the investigation
if the complaint was not resolved informally, and to attempt to negotiate a voluntary compliance agreement if a violation
was found. It does not, however, include specific procedural requirements for investigations, and does not address
compliance reviews that are not based on individual complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;35.172, captioned Investigations and Compliance reviews, makes clear that the same procedures
that apply to complaint investigations also apply to compliance reviews that are not initiated by receipt of a complaint,
but rather are based on other information indicating that discrimination exists in a service, program, or activity
covered by this part. This provision is consistent with the Department's procedures for enforcing title VI at 28 CFR
42.107, as required by the section 504 coordination regulation at 28 CFR 41.5(a)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) of proposed &sect;35.172 explicitly spells out the agency's authority to require a public entity to
cooperate in the investigation by permitting access by the designated agency to its records and other sources of information
and to its facilities. It also makes clear that access by the designated agency may not be barred on the basis of considerations
of privacy or confidentiality and that confidential information obtained by the designated agency shall not be disclosed
except where necessary in formal enforcement proceedings or where otherwise required by law. These provisions of
the proposed rule are based on the enforcement procedures for title VI and section 504 in federally assisted programs,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 28 CFR 42.106 (Department of Justice title VI regulation, as incorporated in the Department of Justice section 504
regulation by 28 CFR 42.530); 45 CFR 80.6, 80.7 (Department of Health and Human Services). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 35.173 of the current regulation establishes requirements for voluntary compliance agreements and would
not be changed by the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 35.174 of the current regulation and &sect;35.174(a) of the proposed regulation provide for referral of
a matter to the Department of Justice when a public entity declines to enter into voluntary compliance negotiations
or when negotiations are unsuccessful. The proposed rule adds a new &sect;35.174(b), which provides that the designated
agency may refer the matter to the Department with a recommendation for appropriate action or use any other means authorized
by law to achieve compliance when there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part that cannot
be corrected by informal means. This provision is taken from language in existing title VI and section 504 regulations
for federally assisted programs.

ADA Standards for Accessible Design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would amend the regulations of the Department of Justice implementing titles II and III of the ADA
to incorporate, as the ADA Standards for Accessible Design, the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities,
currently Appendix A to 28 CFR Part 36, as they are revised in the Access Board's interim rule published elsewhere in
this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (The guidelines set forth in the Access Board's interim rule are effective only as guidance for the Departments of
Justice and Transportation; they have no effect on the public and should not be used by the public until such time as
the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation adopt them as standards.) The ADA Standards will be
set forth in full in the new part 37 of 28 CFR when this rule is printed in final.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ADA Standards set out in the Access Board's interim rule supplement the original ADA Standards by adding specific
requirements applicable to public entities. These requirements are set out in sections 11 through 14 of the Access
Board's interim guidelines, which are special application sections for facilities covered by title II. Section
11 would apply to Judicial, Legislative, and Regulatory Facilities; section 12 to Detention and Correctional Facilities;
section 13 to Accessible Residential Housing subject to title II; and section 14 to Public Rights-of-Way. For a section-by-section
analysis of these requirements, see the Access Board's preamble to its interim rule published in today's

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to purely editorial changes, the Access Board's interim rule contains several substantive changes that
needed to be made to &sect;&sect;3, 4, 7, and 10 of ADAAG, either as a result of the addition of new sections 11&hyph;14
or to make certain provisions of ADAAG specifically applicable to title II facilities. These changes are discussed
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;3.5, the definition of ``alteration'' is revised to explicitly cover pedestrian facilities in the public
right-of-way and to include resurfacing. This change is consistent with the decision in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
114 S. Ct. 1545 (1994), holding that resurfacing of a street constitutes an alteration under the ADA. Also in &sect;3.5,
definitions are being added for the following terms: continuous passage, public right-of-way, public sidewalk,
public sidewalk curb ramp, principal public entrance, site infeasibility, and technically infeasible; and the
term text telephone is being replaced with the term TTY. Finally, the definition of ``transient lodging'' is revised
to include residential facilities rather than facilities that contain one or more dwelling units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general exception in &sect;4.1.1(5)(b)(i) is expanded to include all raised areas used primarily for purposes
of security or life or fire safety; several more examples are added to the non-occupiable spaces listed in &sect;4.1.1(5)(b)(ii);
and &sect;4.1.1(5)(b)(iii) is added to exempt single-occupant structures accessed only by passageways below grade
or elevated above grade, such as certain toll booths.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exception 1 to &sect;4.1.3(5) is expanded to exempt the upper level of drawbridge towers, boat traffic towers, lock
and dam control stations, train dispatching towers, and similar structures less than three stories and not open to
the general public if the upper level houses no more than five persons and is less than 500 square feet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exception 4 to &sect;4.1.3(5) is expanded to allow platform lifts to provide access to raised judges' benches, clerks'
stations, speakers' rostrums, raised daises, jury boxes, and witness stands, and to connect levels within an individual
dwelling unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exception 5 is added to &sect;4.1.3(5) to exempt the cab level and, in some instances, the penultimate floor of air
traffic control towers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Language is added to &sect;4.1.3(8)(a)(i) to require that, in facilities subject to title II, all planned principal
public entrances shall be included within the 50% of public entrances required to be accessible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4.1.3(17)(c)(ii) is expanded to require that, in stadiums, arenas, and convention centers subject to title
II, at least one public TTY shall be provided on each floor level having a public pay telephone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 4.1.3(17)(c) (iv) and (v) are added to require that if an interior public pay telephone is provided in a public
use area of a facility covered by title II, at least one interior public TTY shall be provided in at least one public use
area, and if an interior public pay telephone is provided in the secured area of a detention or correctional facility
subject to section 12, then at least one public TTY shall also be provided in at least one secured area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An exception is added to &sect;4.1.3(17)(d) to exempt the secured areas of detention or correctional facilities
where shelves and outlets are prohibited for purposes of security or safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4.1.3(22) is added to require that permanently-installed swimming pools subject to title II shall be designed
so as to provide at least one means of access into the water, if such swimming pools are intended for recreational purposes
and not intended solely for diving or wading.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The previously-reserved exception to &sect;4.1.7(1)(a) is added to allow alternative methods of access if it is
determined that it is not feasible to provide physical access to a qualified historic building or facility in a manner
that will not threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7.2(3) is added to cover title II facilities, and requires that, where counters have cash registers and are
provided for the sale or distribution of goods or services to the public, at least one of each type shall comply with
7.2(1); at counters that may not have cash registers but at which goods or services are sold or distributed, a portion
of the main counter shall be accessible or an accessible auxiliary counter shall be provided in close proximity; and
at counter or teller windows with solid partitions or security glazing separating personnel from the public, at least
one of each type shall provide a method to facilitate voice communication that is accessible to both individuals who
use wheelchairs and individuals who have difficulty bending or stooping.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10.4.1(8), which was previously reserved, is added to require that, in airports covered by title II, at least
one accessible route shall be provided through fixed security barriers, and where security barriers incorporate
equipment, such as metal detectors, which cannot be made accessible, an accessible route shall be provided adjacent
to such security screening devices. An exception is also added to this section to exempt doors, doorways, and gates
designed to be operated only by security personnel from the requirements of 4.13.6, 4.13.9, 4.13.11, and 4.13.12.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, appendix notes are added for the following sections: 3.5 (definition of transient lodging); 4.1.3(8)(a)(i)
(public entrances); 4.1.3(8)(b) (path of travel to building entrances); 7.2(3)(iii) (counter or teller windows
with partitions); and 10.4.1(8) (security systems in transportation facilities).

Regulatory Process Matters
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice of proposed rulemaking has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order
12866. The Access Board has analyzed the impact of applying its proposed amendments to ADAAG to entities covered by
titles II and III of the ADA and has determined that they are a significant regulatory action for purposes of Executive
Order 12866. The Access Board has prepared a Regulatory Assessment, which includes a cost impact analysis for certain
accessibility elements and a discussion of the regulatory alternatives considered. Adoption of the revised ADA
Standards as the standards for title II is, therefore, also a significant regulatory action to which the Access Board's
Regulatory Assessment would apply. Comments submitted to the Access Board on its Regulatory Assessment will also
be considered by the Department as comments on this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Access Board has determined that this proposed rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities and, therefore, has included the flexibility analysis required by the Regulatory Flexibility
Act in its Regulatory Assessment. The Access Board has made every effort to lessen the economic impacts of its proposed
rule on small entities, but recognizes that such impacts are the necessary result of the mandate of the ADA itself.
The Access Board's analysis also applies to the Department's proposed adoption of the revised ADAAG. The Department's
proposed procedural amendments will not have a significant economic impact on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Access Board has made every effort to lessen the impact of its proposed guidelines on state and local governments,
but recognizes that the guidelines will have some federalism impacts. These impacts are discussed in the Access Board's
Regulatory Assessment, which also applies to the Department's proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12875 prohibits executive departments and agencies from promulgating any regulation that is not
required by statute and that creates a mandate upon a state, local, or tribal government unless certain conditions
are met. The Access Board is required by statute to issue minimum guidelines for the purposes of implementing titles
II and III of the ADA (42 USC 12204). The Department of Justice is required by statute to promulgate regulations that
implement title II of the ADA and that are consistent with the minimum guidelines and requirements issued by the Access
Board (42 USC 12134). Because the Department of Justice is required by statute to promulgate regulations that do not
go below the Access Board's minimum guidelines, and because this rule adopts guidelines issued by the Access Board
as also required by statute, this rule is required by statute. Therefore, the special conditions in Executive Order
12875 need not be met. However, the Department will provide any comments submitted that suggest ways to make compliance
less burdensome or that would improve the effectiveness of the title II regulation in achieving its objective.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g.,

 (1) Each facility or part of a facility altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity in a manner that affects
or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be altered
in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,
if the alteration was commenced after January 26, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alteration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For the purposes of this part, an alteration is a change to a facility that affects or could affect the usability of the
building or facility or any part thereof. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Alterations include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic
restoration, resurfacing, changes or rearrangement in structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement
in the plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions. Normal maintenance, reroofing, painting or wallpapering,
asbestos removal, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability
of the building or facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If existing elements, spaces, or common areas are altered, then each such altered element, space, or area shall
comply with the applicable provisions of appendix A to part 37 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
To the maximum extent feasible.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The phrase ``to the maximum extent feasible,'' as used in this section, applies to the occasional case where the nature
of an existing facility makes it virtually impossible to comply fully with applicable accessibility standards through
a planned alteration. In these circumstances, the alteration shall provide the maximum physical accessibility
feasible. Any altered features of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible. If providing
accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs)
would not be feasible, the facility shall be made accessible to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those
who use crutches, those who have impaired vision or hearing, or those who have other impairments).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area of a facility that contains a primary
function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area and
the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and usable
by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the cost and scope of such alterations
is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Primary function.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A ``primary function'' is a major activity for which the facility is intended. Areas that contain a primary function
include, but are not limited to, the meeting rooms in a conference center, as well as offices and other work areas in
which the activities of the public entity using the facility are carried out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, employee lounges or locker rooms, janitorial closets,
entrances, and corridors are not areas containing a primary function. Restrooms are not areas containing a primary
function, unless the provision of restrooms is the principal purpose of the area, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in highway rest stops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For the purposes of this section, alterations to windows, hardware, controls, electrical outlets, and signage
shall not be deemed to be alterations that affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Path of travel.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A ``path of travel'' includes a continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means of which the altered
area may be approached, entered, and exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior approach (including
sidewalks, streets, and parking areas), an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An accessible path of travel may consist of walks and sidewalks, curb ramps and other interior or exterior pedestrian
ramps; clear floor paths through lobbies, corridors, rooms, and other improved areas; parking access aisles; elevators
and lifts; or a combination of these elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For the purposes of this part, the term ``path of travel'' also includes the restrooms, telephones, and drinking
fountains serving the altered area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disproportionality.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area will be deemed disproportionate to
the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to provide an accessible path of travel may include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance and an accessible route to the altered area, for example,
the cost of widening doorways or installing ramps; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Costs associated with making restrooms accessible, such as installing grab bars, enlarging toilet stalls,
insulating pipes, or installing accessible faucet controls; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Costs associated with providing accessible telephones, such as relocating the telephone to an accessible
height, installing amplification devices, or installing a telecommunications device for deaf persons (TDD); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible drinking fountain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Duty to provide accessible features in the event of disproportionality.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) When the cost of alterations necessary to make the path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is disproportionate
to the cost of the overall alteration, the path of travel shall be made accessible to the extent that it can be made accessible
without incurring disproportionate costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In choosing which accessible elements to provide, priority should be given to those elements that will provide
the greatest access, in the following order: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An accessible entrance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An accessible route to the altered area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Accessible telephones; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Accessible drinking fountains; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) When possible, additional accessible elements such as parking, storage, and alarms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Series of smaller alterations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The obligation to provide an accessible path of travel may not be evaded by performing a series of small alterations
to the area served by a single path of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a single undertaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) (i) If an area containing a primary function has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to
that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area on the same path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of alterations
to the primary function areas on that path of travel during the preceding three-year period shall be considered in
determining whether the cost of making that path of travel accessible is disproportionate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Only alterations undertaken after the effective date of this amendment shall be considered in determining if
the cost of providing an accessible path of travel is disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is proposing to amend its rules implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by adopting
as its standards revised accessibility guidelines issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance
Board (Access Board). The Access Board has published these revised accessibility guidelines as interim final rules
elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The proposed rule would also make a conforming change to the Department's rule implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973, as amended. The rules would expand the Department's accessibility standards to cover public rights-of-way
and other subjects added by the Access Board to its guidelines.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 All timely comments received by the Access Board on its guidelines published December 21, 1992 (57 FR 60612), and on
its interim final rule published today, will be deemed by the Department to have been submitted in response to this
proposed rule and will be considered fully as the Department works toward a final rule based on this proposal. Therefore,
it is not necessary for any comments submitted to the Board on its proposed or interim rules to be resubmitted to the
Department.

, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB) is publishing amendments to its accessibility
guidelines for buildings and facilities, relating to state and local government facilities. The Department's September
6, 1991, final Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) rule (49 CFR Part 37) adopted the original version of these guidelines,
known as the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), as its accessibility standards
for facilities subject to Part 37. The standards are codified as Appendix A to 49 CFR Part 37.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would adopt the amended Access Board guidelines as a new Appendix A to Part 37, replacing the Department's
current Appendix A. The Access Board received public comments on its proposed guidelines, published on December
21, 1992, and will receive comments again on today's interim final rule. As a member of the Access Board, the Department
will be actively involved in the review and analysis of comments the Access Board receives and in making any revisions
on the guidelines in response to those comments. Therefore, the Department has proposed to adopt the amended guidelines
as its accessibility standards. Comments submitted to the Access Board will be considered by the Department as comments
on this proposed rule, and need not be separately submitted to the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the Department of Justice's existing rule implementing Title II of the ADA, for state and local government
facilities, the Department's rule implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (49 CFR Part 27) gives
recipients the choice, in some circumstances, of complying either with the ADAAG or with the older Uniform Federal
Accessibility Standard (UFAS). In its ADA proposal being published today, DOJ is proposing to eliminate the option
to use UFAS. Title II entities would have to use ADAAG in all cases. To remain consistent with Access Board and Department
of Justice actions, the Department is also proposing to eliminate the UFAS option. To this end, the Department proposes
to revise its 504 rule to require design, construction, or alteration of all facilities subject to Part 27 to conform
to the revised AADAG. As a technical amendment, the Department is also proposing to update a reference in Part 27 to
Department of Justice ADA regulations.

On November 30, 1993, the Department amended Part 37 to extend the compliance deadline for the requirement to install
detectable warnings on platform edges of key rail stations. The final rule reaffirmed the Department's view that
detectable warnings are an essential safety feature of rail stations for persons with impaired vision. The Department
is not, through this proposal, seeking further comment on the issue of detectable warnings on rail station platform
edges. The Department will regard any comments received on this subject as outside the scope of this rulemaking.

Regulatory Analyses and Notices

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This NPRM has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The Access Board has
analyzed the impact of applying its amendments to ADAAG to entities covered by Titles II and III of the ADA and has determined
that they are a significant regulatory action for purposes of the Executive Order. The Access Board has also prepared
a Regulatory Assessment, which includes a cost impact analysis for certain accessibility elements and a discussion
of the regulatory alternatives considered. This Regulatory Assessment applies to the Department's proposed adoption
of the Access Board's guidelines. Comments submitted to the Access Board on its Regulatory Assessment will be considered
by the Department as comments on this NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Access Board has determined that its guidelines will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities and, therefore, has included in its Regulatory Assessment a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.
The Access Board has made every effort to lessen the economic impacts of its proposed rule on small entities, but recognizes
that such impacts are the necessary result of the mandate of the ADA itself. The Access Board's flexibility analysis
also applies to the Department's proposed adoption of the revised ADAAG.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Access Board also made every effort to lessen the impact of its proposed guidelines on state and local governments,
but recognizes that the guidelines will have some federalism impacts. These impacts are discussed in the Access Board's
Regulatory Assessment which, as noted above, also applies to this NPRM.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 17, 1994, the FAA issued Notice No. 94&hyph;4, entitled ``Overflights of Units of the National Park System.''
Notice No. 94&hyph;4 sought comment on general policy and specific recommendations for voluntary and regulatory
actions to address the effects of aircraft overflights on national parks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By a request dated May 12, 1994, the NPCA asked that the comment period be extended 30 days. The NPCA explained that,
unlike the airtour industry and other vested interests that have formed cohesive groups with streamlined communications
systems, its 400,000 members are individual citizens who share an interest of protecting and preserving the national
parks and national park values and are reliant on periodic contact with the NPCA. It indicated that the additional
time would allow it to make the contents of the notice available to interested members, and allow it sufficient time
to digest the notice and draft and file comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to give the NCPA and its members additional time to prepare comments, the FAA finds that it would be in the public
interest to extend the comment period by 30 days. Accordingly, the comment period is being extended to July 15, 1994,
to afford all interested persons the opportunity to comment on this notice.
