SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action modifies the Class E airspace at Refugio, TX. Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground
level, has been designated at the Mellon Ranch Airport, Refugio, TX. This airspace overlies Rooke Field, located
approximately 6 nautical miles (NM) west of the Mellon Ranch Airport. Operators at Rooke Field have requested that
Rooke Field be excluded from the Class E airspace at Mellon Ranch Airport. Since the airspace within a 1/2 mile radius
of Rooke Field is not needed to conduct safe operations, this action is intended to exclude that airspace from the Mellon
Ranch Airport, Refugio, TX, Class E airspace.

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 9, 1994, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class
E airspace at Refugio, TX, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 11010).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. One commenter expressed concern about excluding the airspace within a 2 NM radius of Rooke
Field from the Class E airspace at Mellon Ranch Airport. However, in a subsequent comment, the same commenter stated
that he had no objection to excluding the airspace within a 1/2 mile radius of Rooke Field from the Mellon Ranch Airport
Class E airspace. After further analysis, the FAA concurs with the final position of the commenter and is reducing
the amount of excluded airspace to that airspace within a 1/2 mile radius of Rooke Field. This change will allow the
continuation of more controlled airspace for the Mellon Ranch Airport while relinquishing unneeded control over
the operations at Rooke Field. Additionally, the NPRM incorrectly listed the airspace in the narrative description
as ``E2''. The designation of E2 is used to designate Class E airspace from the surface. The correct designation for
this Class E airspace is ``E5''. Except for these modifications, this amendment is adopted as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace
areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A
dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298;
July 6, 1994). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations modifies the Class E airspace located at Refugio, TX.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action modifies the Class E airspace at Dallas/Fort Worth, TX. An amendment to the very high frequency omnidirectional
range/distance measuring equipment (VOR/DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) at Cleburne Municipal
Airport, Cleburne, TX, has necessitated this action. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground
level designated in conjunction with an airport for which an approved instrument approach procedure has been prescribed
is needed to control aircraft executing the SIAP's. This action is intended to provide adequate Class E airspace for
IFR operations at Cleburne, TX.

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 1, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class
E airspace at Dallas/Fort Worth, TX, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 63309).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. Except for latitude/longitude position updates for Dallas/Fort
Worth International Airport; McKinney Municipal Airport; Mesquite, Phil Hudson Municipal Airport; Mesquite radio
beacon (RBN); Lancaster RBN; Fort Worth Spinks Airport; Weatherford, Parker Country Airport; Bridgeport Municipal
Airport; and Decatur Municipal Airport, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace
areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A
dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298;
July 6, 1994). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revises the Class E airspace located at Dallas/Fort
Worth, TX, to provide for adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the SIAP's at Cleburne, TX.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need
frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated
impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Consumer Product Safety Commission (``Commission'') is issuing a rule to exempt a system of records from certain
provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a (``Privacy Act''), to the extent that the system contains investigatory
material pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws or compiled for law enforcement purposes. The system of records
includes the investigative files of the Office of Inspector General of the Commission.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Commission proposed this rule on August 2, 1990, at 55 FR 31404. No comments have been received, and the rule is being
issued without change except for a fuller description of the record system subject to the rule and the correction of
typographical errors. The purpose and effect of the rule is set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Inspector General Act, 5 U.S.C. App., authorizes the Office of Inspector General of the Commission to conduct
investigations to detect fraud and abuse in the programs and operations of the Commission and to assist in the prosecution
of participants in such fraud or abuse. The Office of Inspector General of the Commission maintains information in
a system of records, identified as ``Office of the Inspector General Investigative Files_CPSC&hyph;6,'' pursuant
to its law enforcement and criminal investigation functions. Disclosure of information in these investigatory
files or disclosure of the identity of confidential sources could seriously undermine the effectiveness of the Inspector
General's investigations. For example, premature disclosure of information of such investigations could enable
suspects to take action to prevent detection of criminal activities, conceal or destroy evidence, or escape prosecution.
Premature disclosure of this information could also lead to the possible intimidation of, or harm to, informants,
witnesses, or investigative personnel and their families. Further, the imposition of certain Privacy Act restrictions
on the manner in which information is collected, verified, or retained could significantly impede the effectiveness
of the Inspector General's investigations and could preclude the apprehension and successful prosecution of persons
engaged in fraud or criminal activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the Commission is issuing a rule to exempt this system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act where
application of the Privacy Act would interfere with the conduct of an investigation by the Inspector General. Section
(k)(2) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), provides the authority for agencies to exempt records containing
investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purpose from certain other provisions of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information in this system of records may also be used for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility,
or qualifications for federal civilian employment. Section (k)(5) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), provides
that investigatory material compiled solely for those purposes may be exempted from certain other provisions of
the Privacy Act, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who
furnished information under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. The rule
being issued provides for such exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16 CFR 1014.12 currently exempts other systems of records from certain requirements of the Privacy Act. This rule
adds a new paragraph to &sect;1014.12 to exempt the Inspector General's investigative files from certain requirements
of the Privacy Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that the
amendment to 16 CFR 1014.12, Specific Exemptions, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17689), FDA published a final rule that amended the standard of identity for evaporated milk
(21 CFR 131.130) to: (1) Reduce the minimum milkfat content requirement from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent by weight;
(2) reduce the minimum total milk solids content requirement from 25 percent to 23 percent by weight; and (3) add a minimum
milk solids-not-fat content requirement of 16.5 percent by weight. This action was based on a petition from the American
Dairy Products Institute, 130 North Franklin St., Chicago, IL 60606.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA gave interested persons until May 16, 1994, to file objections or requests for a hearing. The agency received no
objections or requests for a hearing on the final rule. Therefore, FDA finds that the final rule published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 This document contains final income tax regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing rules for allocating net operating loss or taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income, and net capital loss or gain, within the taxable year in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which a loss corporation has an ownership change under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. These regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit the loss corporation to elect to allocate these amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the period ending on the change date and the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning on the day after the change date as if its books were

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains final regulations to be added to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 382 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Code. The final regulations provide rules for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the allocation of net operating loss or taxable income and net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital loss or gain within the taxable year in which a loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporation has an ownership change. Proposed regulations on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this subject were set forth in a notice of proposed rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 19, 1992 (57 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
54535). The IRS received public comments on the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. No public hearing was requested and none was held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having considered the comments submitted, the IRS and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury Department adopt the proposed regulations as revised by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this Treasury decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following an ownership change, section 382 limits the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of post-change income that may be offset by a corporation's pre-change loss. Sections 382(b)(3)(A) and (d)(1) require
that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except as provided in section 382(h)(5) (relating to certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built-in gains and losses) and in regulations, taxable income or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net operating loss must be allocated ratably to each day in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change year for purposes of applying the section 382 limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 383, similar rules apply with respect to pre-change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital losses and certain pre-change credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide rules for allocation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net operating loss or taxable income, and net capital loss or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gain, within the change year. The proposed regulations generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that a loss corporation may allocate such items between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pre-change period and the post-change period (1) by ratably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocating an equal portion to each day in the change year, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) if it so elects, based on a closing of its books as of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change date. The final regulations adopt the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations with few changes. The most significant comments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes are described below.

A. Consistency Rules for Consolidated and Controlled Groups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations provide consistency rules for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporations that are members of consolidated groups or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled groups. These consistency rules are based on proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations applying section 382 to consolidated and controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups. The consistency rules contained in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations have been revised in the final regulations because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed consolidated and controlled group regulations have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not been finalized yet. The final regulations provide that if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closing-of-the-books election is made with respect to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ownership change occurring during a consolidated return year, all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocations with respect to that ownership change must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the election. Further consideration will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given to consistency rules for consolidated groups in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of final regulations applying section 382 to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups.

B. Limitation Increase Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Notice 87&hyph;79, 1987&hyph;2 C.B. 387, the IRS announced its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intention to issue regulations that would allow taxpayers to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a closing-of-the-books election. The Notice stated that, prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the issuance of regulations, taxpayers would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use the statutory ratable allocation method unless they obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a private letter ruling allowing them to use a different method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to Notice 87&hyph;79, the IRS issued a number of private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter rulings that authorized allocations based on a closing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the taxpayers' books. Some of these rulings allowed taxpayers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in their section 382 limitation to the extent that any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net pre-change income was offset by net post-change loss in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computing taxable income or loss for the change year. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of the increased limitation was to put the taxpayer in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position similar to the position it would have been in had its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxable year ended on the change date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interest of simplicity, the proposed regulations do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not include a rule providing for increases in the annual section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
382 limitation in cases in which net post-change loss offsets net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pre-change income. Several commentators questioned the failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to include a limitation increase rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations retain the approach of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, in which change year income and losses may be netted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together without limitation. This approach may be either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
favorable or unfavorable to taxpayers, depending on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. This approach is disadvantageous when it results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the netting of a post-change loss against pre-change income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conversely, the approach is advantageous to taxpayers that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to net a pre-change loss against post-change income without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation. In these cases, if the taxpayers' year had ended on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change date, the loss so used would have been subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 382 limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adoption of a limitation increase rule would add significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complexity to the regulations. If taxpayers were protected from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disadvantages of netting a post-change loss against pre- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change income, consistency would require that taxpayers not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed the benefit of netting pre-change loss against post- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change income without limitation. In other words, detailed rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for applying the section 382 limitation within the change year to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit the use of a loss in the pre-change portion of the year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against income in the post-change period would be necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concomitants of a limitation increase rule. To avoid this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complexity, the final regulations allow change year losses to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offset change year income without limitation and do not include a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation increase rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Additional Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preamble to the proposed regulations requested comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the interaction of the ratable allocation rules under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations and the built-in gain and loss rules under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 382(h), particularly with respect to extraordinary items 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an asset sale not made in the ordinary course of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business). A commentator recommended that the final regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include both a rule for extraordinary items and the limitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase rule (described in paragraph B above). After due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration, the IRS and the Treasury Department decided that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules relating to extraordinary items would add unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complexity to the final regulations. Thus, the final regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not contain special rules with respect to the allocation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extraordinary items. The IRS and the Treasury Department may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give further consideration to the desirability of rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressing extraordinary items.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on small business.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) of this section, a loss corporation must allocate its net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating loss or taxable income (see section 382(k)(4)), and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net capital loss (see section 1222(10)) or modified capital gain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net income (as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section), for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change year between the pre-change period and the post-change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period by ratably allocating an equal portion to each day in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subject to paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (d) of this section, a loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporation may elect to allocate its net operating loss or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxable income and its net capital loss or modified capital gain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net income for the change year between the pre-change period and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the post-change period as if the loss corporation's books were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed on the change date. An election under this paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) does not terminate the loss corporation's taxable year as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the change date (e.g., the change year is a single tax year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of section 172).

Time and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A loss corporation makes the closing-of-the-books 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election by including the following statement on the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement required by &sect;1.382&hyph;2T(a)(2)(ii) for the change year: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``THE CLOSING-OF-THE-BOOKS ELECTION UNDER &sect;1.382&hyph;6(b) IS HEREBY 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE OWNERSHIP CHANGE OCCURRING ON [INSERT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DATE].'' The election must be made on or before the due date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including extensions) of the loss corporation's income tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return for the change year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Election irrevocable. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An election under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) is irrevocable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consolidated groups. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an election under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) is made with respect to an ownership change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurring in a consolidated return year, all allocations under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section with respect to that ownership change must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the election. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Controlled groups. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section does not apply, and if, as part of the same plan or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangement, two or more members of a controlled group (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in section 1563(a), determined by substituting ``50

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard to section 1563(a)(4)), have ownership changes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be members of the controlled group (or become members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the same other controlled group), a closing-of-the-books 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
election applies only if the election is made by all members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having the ownership changes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the change year_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Net operating loss or taxable income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is determined without regard to gains or losses on the sale or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchange of capital assets; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Net operating loss or taxable income and net capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss or modified capital gain net income are determined without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard to the section 382 limitation and do not include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following items, which are allocated entirely to the post-change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Any income, gain, loss, or deduction to which section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
382(h)(5)(A) applies; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Any income or gain recognized on the disposition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets transferred to the loss corporation during the post-change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period for a principal purpose of ameliorating the section 382 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adjustment to net operating loss_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining capital gain. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amount of modified capital gain net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income (defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) allocated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each period is offset by capital losses to which section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
382(h)(5)(A) applies and capital loss carryovers, subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 382 limitation (in the case of modified capital gain net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income allocated to the post-change period).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gain. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amount of net operating loss allocated to each period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is reduced (but not below zero) without regard to the section 382 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation, first by the modified capital gain net income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining in the same period, and then by the modified capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gain net income remaining in the other period.

Coordination with rules relating to the allocation of income under &sect;1.1502&hyph;76(b).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If &sect;1.1502&hyph;76 applies (relating to the taxable year of members of a consolidated group), an allocation
of items under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is determined after applying &sect;1.1502&hyph;76. Thus, if a
short taxable year under &sect;1.1502&hyph;76 is a change year for which an allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this section is to be made, the allocation under this section applies only to the items allocated to that short
taxable year under &sect;1.1502&hyph;76. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allocation of certain credits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The principles of this section apply for purposes of allocating, under section 383, excess foreign taxes under section
904(c), current year business credits under section 38, and the minimum tax credit under section 53. The loss corporation
must use the same method of allocation (ratable allocation or closing-of-the-books) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of sections 382 and 383. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Examples.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rules of this section are illustrated by the following examples: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Assume that the loss corporation, L, a calendar year taxpayer with a May 26, 1995, change date, determines a section
382 limitation under section 382(b)(1) of $100,000. Thus, for the change year, its section 382 limitation is $100,000
&times; (219/365)=$60,000. L makes the closing-of-the- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
books election under paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Assume that L has a $150,000 capital loss carryover (from its 1994 taxable year) and a $300,000 net operating loss
carryover (from its 1994 taxable year) to the change year. L recognizes, in the pre-change period, $200,000 of ordinary
loss, and, in the post-change period, $150,000 of capital gain and $100,000 of ordinary income. Assume that section
382(h) does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to the capital gain or the ordinary income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) L has a $100,000 net operating loss for the change year ($200,000 pre-change loss less $100,000 post-change
income), as determined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Because L has no current year capital losses, L's
$150,000 capital gain recognized in the post-change period is its modified capital gain net income for the change
year (as defined at paragraph (g)(4) of this section). L allocates $100,000 of net operating loss to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pre-change period and $150,000 of modified capital gain net income to the post-change period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, L uses its capital loss carryover to offset its modified capital gain
net income allocated to the post-change period, subject to its section 382 limitation. L's section 382 limitation
is $60,000, so L uses $60,000 of its capital loss carryover to offset $60,000 of its $150,000 modified capital gain
net income. L has absorbed its entire section 382 limitation for the change year and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$90,000 of modified capital gain net income remaining in the post-change period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, L offsets its $100,000 net operating loss allocated to the pre-change
period by the $90,000 of modified capital gain net income remaining in the post-change period, without regard to the
section 382 limitation, thereby reducing its pre-change net operating loss to $10,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) From its 1994 taxable year, L will carry over $90,000 of capital loss and $300,000 of net operating loss to its 1996
taxable year. From its 1995 taxable year, L will carry over $10,000 of net operating loss subject to the section 382
limitation to its 1996 taxable year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) Assume the facts of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 except that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
L does not make the closing-of-the-books election under paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) L ratably allocates its $100,000 net operating loss and its $150,000 of modified capital gain net income for the
change year. $40,000 of net operating loss ($100,000 &times; (146/365)) and $60,000 of modified capital gain net
income ($150,000 &times; (146/365)) are allocated to the pre-change period. $60,000 of net operating loss ($100,000
&times; (219/365)) and $90,000 of modified capital gain net income ($150,000 &times; (219/365)) are allocated to
the post-change period.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, L uses its capital loss carryovers to offset modified capital gain
net income. The capital loss carryovers offset the $60,000 modified capital gain net income allocated to the pre-change
period without limitation. Subject to the section 382 limitation, the remaining $90,000 of capital loss carryovers
offset the modified capital gain net income allocated to the post-change period. Accordingly, L uses $60,000 of its
capital loss carryovers to offset $60,000 of its $90,000 modified capital gain net income allocated to the post-change
period. L has absorbed its entire section 382 limitation for the change year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, L's $60,000 net operating loss allocated to the post-change period
is offset by its remaining $30,000 of post-change modified capital gain net income, reducing its post-change net
operating loss to $30,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) From its 1994 taxable year, L will carry over $30,000 of capital loss and $300,000 of net operating loss to its 1996
taxable year. From its 1995 taxable year, L will carry over $70,000 of net operating loss ($40,000 pre-change +$30,000
post-change) to its 1996 taxable year. The $40,000 pre-change portion of that carryover is subject to the section
382 limitation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. On page 22324, column 3, remove the third full paragraph beginning ``Institutions may choose .&blank;.&blank;.'',
and insert in its place ``An institution substantiates its compliance with this standard by having either the auditor
who prepares its financial statement audit or the auditor who prepares its title IV, HEA program compliance audit
report on the accuracy of its compliance determination. The auditor's report must be based on performing an ``attestation
engagement'' in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA's) Statement on
Standards for Attestation Engagements. The auditor must submit his or her report with the appropriate audit report.
In the attestation report, the auditor must indicate whether the institution's determination that the percentage
of its revenues derived from title IV, HEA program funds is not more than 85 percent of its revenues is accurate; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is today amending the table of currently approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information collection request (ICR) control numbers issued by OMB for various regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's amendment updates the table to accurately display those information requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated under the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act. The affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations are codified at 40 CFR parts 30, 31 and 33. EPA will continue to present OMB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control numbers in a consolidated table format to be codified in 48 CFR Part 1501 of EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acquisition Regulations, in 40 CFR Part 9 of the Agency's regulations, and in each 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume containing EPA regulations. The table lists the part and section numbers with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and the current OMB control numbers. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
display of the OMB control numbers and their subsequent codification in the Code of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR Part 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ICR(s) were previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval. As a result, EPA finds that there is ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this table without prior notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be unnecessary.

Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 162.3(c), and include,
but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting and spreading
agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; and emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not intended to imply to nontoxicity;
the ingredient may or may not be chemically active.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. The data submitted in the petitions and other
relevant material have been evaluated. This inert ingredient is considered useful for the purpose for which the tolerance
is sought. Toxicological, ecological, and environmental fate data were considered in evaluating this inert ingredient
for use in pesticides. The data considered in support of these exemptions from tolerance include:

Residue data is generally not required for inert ingredient exemptions from tolerance. In this case, worst-case
residue calculations were done based on the proposed uses. These calculations indicated that a broad exemption could
not be granted without additional residue information because of the potential for high dietary exposure. The petitioner
therefore requested that the exemption be modified to include only the use of these solvents in cotton defoliant formulations
containing thidiazuron and diuron as active ingrdients. This yielded worstcase residue estimates of 735 ppm in cotton
seed, concentrating to 4,630 ppm in cottonseed oil. Consumption of cottonseed oil in children, the subgroup with
the highest exposure, is .036355 gms/kg/day. This leads to an exposure of .18 mg/kg/day, with a margin of exposure
of 166 from the NOAEL in the 90 day dog study. Residue information from thidiazuron as a cotton defoliant indicates
that actual residues for these inerts are expected to be orders of magnitude below this worst-case estimate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, these ingredients are useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore,
EPA proposes that the exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.

, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof, or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat.
1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising
tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

 In the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17751), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc.,
Barley Mill Plaza, P.O. Box 80038, Wilmington, DE 19880-0038, had submitted pesticide petitions (PP) 1F3961 and
1F3962 to EPA proposing that 40 CFR part 180 be amended under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
21 U.S.C. 346a, by establishing tolerances for the herbicides thifensulfuron methyl (methyl-3-[[[[(4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]-2-thiophene
carboxylate) and tribenuron methyl (methyl-2-[[[[

- (4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl) methylamino] carbonyl] amino]sulfonyl] benzoate), each on the raw
agricultural commodities (RAC) oat grain at 0.05 part per million (ppm) and oat straw at 0.1 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerances will protect the public health.
Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A hospital must provide inpatient hospital services to individuals who have health coverage provided by either the
Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) or the Civilian Health and Medical Program
of the Veterans Administration (CHAMPVA), subject to limitations provided by regulations that require the hospital
to collect the beneficiary's cost-share and accept payment from the CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA programs as payment in full.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A hospital must provide inpatient hospital services to military veterans (subject to the limitations provided in
38 CFR 17.50 ff.) and accept payment from the Department of Veterans Affairs as payment in full. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A hospital must give each Medicare beneficiary (or his or her representative) at or about the time of admission, a written
statement of his or her rights concerning discharge from the hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A hospital (including a rural primary care hospital) with an emergency department must provide, upon request and
within the capabilities of the hospital or rural primary care hospital, an appropriate medical screening examination,
stabilizing treatment and/or an appropriate transfer to another medical facility to any individual with an emergency
medical condition, regardless of the individual's eligibility for Medicare.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 16, 1988, we published a proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning participation in the CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA programs, hospital admissions for veterans, a requirement
for a discharge rights notice, and hospital responsibility for emergency care (53 FR 22513). Below is a discussion
of the issues for which we proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Participation in the CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CHAMPUS (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services) and CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical
Program of the Veterans Administration) programs pay for health care services furnished to dependents and survivors
of military personnel, to retirees and their dependents, and to veterans. Generally, the programs have paid hospitals
based on the hospital's charges. Section 931 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1984 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. 98&hyph;94), authorized these programs to pay (to the extent practicable) for inpatient hospital services
using Medicare payment procedures. Because the Medicare prospective payment system (the system whereby we pay a
hospital a predetermined amount based on the patient's diagnosis and any surgical procedures performed, rather
than by the number of days hospitalized) results in Medicare cost savings, the Department of Defense (DoD) expected
to realize similar savings if it were to use a model similar to Medicare's prospective payment system. Paying on the
basis of a fixed rate appropriate to the particular diagnosis involved has been shown to be an equitable method of paying
for hospital care. Therefore, the Office of Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (OCHAMPUS)
published a final rule on September 1, 1987, that included provisions for the implementation of a DRG-based payment
system modeled after Medicare's prospective payment system for CHAMPUS inpatient hospital admissions occurring
on or after October 1, 1987 (52 FR 32992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospitals that furnish services to CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA beneficiaries are authorized to provide services to these
beneficiaries following an approval process similar to that used for Medicare participation. Generally, that means
the hospital is licensed and accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO),
and otherwise meets CHAMPUS requirements. A hospital certified and participating under Medicare may be deemed to
meet CHAMPUS requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Participation'' has a different meaning for CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA than for Medicare. Providers have been able to
decide on a claim-by-claim basis whether to ``participate'' in the program and thus accept the CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA-determined
allowable amount, plus the patient cost-share, as payment in full. Beneficiaries are required to pay a cost-share
for each hospital admission. The CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA payment, plus the beneficiary's cost-share, constitute payment
in full for the covered services when the provider signs and submits an appropriately completed program claim form
that indicates participation. Under Medicare, hospitals must agree to bill the program for all beneficiaries and
accept the CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA payment as payment in full (less applicable deductibles, coinsurance amounts, and noncovered
items). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, Medicare hospitals also may be authorized providers in CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA on the basis of their
JCAHO-approved status or may be deemed authorized providers based on their Medicare-approved status. The benefits
to the DoD of requiring the providers to be paid either under a DRG-based payment system or based on reasonable cost
are lost, however, if the hospitals can selectively participate in the CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 9122 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), Pub. L. 99&hyph;272, all
Medicare hospitals are now required, beginning January 1987, to participate in CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA as authorized
providers (that is, they must bill CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA and accept the CHAMPVA/CHAMPUS-determined allowable amount
as payment in full, less applicable deductible, patient cost-share, and noncovered items). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Participation in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Broadly speaking, a veteran can only receive services from a non-VA hospital for a service-connected disability
when there is a medical emergency or when a VA facility is not available. In such cases, the VA in the past paid for the
services based on usual and customary charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As this type of payment is more expensive than payment made on a prospective basis or based on reasonable costs, the
VA has implemented a national prospective payment system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To alleviate hospital expenses for the VA, Congress passed section 233 of the Veterans' Benefit Improvement and Health-Care
Authorization Act of 1986 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. 99&hyph;576). This section requires Medicare hospitals to be participating providers of medical care to
veterans eligible to receive care at the hospital. The hospital then receives payment for the services under the applicable
VA payment system, in accord with the recent regulations concerning the payment methodology and amounts that the
VA provides for those hospitals that furnish inpatient hospital care to veterans whose care has been authorized or
will be sponsored by the VA (55 FR 42848). This rule was developed jointly by VA and HHS, and the VA payment system conforms
to Medicare's hospital inpatient prospective payment system in most cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Statement of Beneficiary Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the prospective payment system became effective for the Medicare program, we began to hear allegations that
Medicare beneficiaries were discharged too early from the hospital. We also began to receive complaints that patients
did not understand their rights as Medicare beneficiaries in cases in which they were advised that discharge was appropriate
but they disagreed. On April 17, 1985, we revised 42 CFR 466.78(b)(3) to require all hospitals to provide Medicare
beneficiaries with information about Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization (PRO) review, including
beneficiary appeal rights (50 FR 15331). In further response to concerns about early discharges and lack of adequate
appeal information, we began requiring all hospitals to furnish each Medicare beneficiary upon admission a specific
statement developed by HCFA (that is, ``An Important Message from Medicare'' (see Appendix I)) telling a beneficiary
of his or her rights to be fully informed about decisions affecting Medicare coverage or payment and about his or her
appeal rights in response to any hospital's notice to the effect that Medicare will no longer cover the care. The ``Message''
we developed also advises the patient of what to do when he or she receives such a hospital statement and how to elicit
more information. The requirements relating to ``An Important Message from Medicare'' were incorporated into the
program's operating instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress subsequently passed section 9305(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA 86). Now, as
part of its participation agreement with Medicare, each hospital (including those not paid under the prospective
payment system) must agree to furnish each Medicare beneficiary with a notice, at or about the time of admission, that
explains the patient's rights in detail.

D. Responsibilities of Medicare Participating Hospitals in Emergency Cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hospitals that choose to participate in the Medicare program agree in writing to meet various requirements included
in section 1866 of the Social Security Act (the Act). Before enactment of COBRA on April 7, 1986, the Act did not specifically
address the issue of how hospitals with emergency medical departments must handle individuals who have emergency
medical conditions or who are in labor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its Report accompanying H.R. 3128, the House Ways and Means Committee indicated that Congress was concerned about
the increasing number of reports that hospital emergency rooms were refusing to accept or treat individuals with
emergency conditions if the patients did not have medical insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Report stated that there were reports that individuals in an unstable condition were transferred
improperly, sometimes without the consent of the receiving hospital. Because Congress believed that this situation
may have worsened since the Medicare prospective payment system for hospitals became effective, the Report stated
that the Committee ``wants to provide a strong assurance that pressures for greater hospital efficiency are not to
be construed as license to ignore traditional community responsibilities and loosen historic standards.'' (H.R.
Rep. No. 99&hyph;241, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 27 (1985).) Subsequently, section 9121 of COBRA, sections 6003(g)(3)(D)(XIV),
6018, and 6211 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA 89), Pub. L. 101&hyph;239, and sections 4008(b),
4027(a), and 4027(k)(3) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90), Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, have all
addressed this concern.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9122 of COBRA amended section 1866(a)(1) of the Act by adding a new paragraph (J), which requires hospitals
in the Medicare program to be participating providers of medical care, for inpatient services only, under any health
plan contracted for under 10 U.S.C. 1079 or 1086 (CHAMPUS) or under 38 U.S.C. 613 (CHAMPVA), in accordance with admission
practices and payment methodology and amounts as prescribed under joint regulations issued by the Secretaries of
Health and Human Services, Defense, and Transportation. This requirement applies to services furnished to CHAMPUS
and CHAMPVA beneficiaries admitted on or after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1987. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Section 9122 of COBRA also required that the legislation apply to all agreements entered into on or after April 7,
1986, but this requirement was deleted by section 1895(b)(6) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;514), enacted
October 22, 1986.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 233 of the Veterans' Benefit Improvement and Health-Care Authorization Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;576)
was enacted on October 28, 1986. It added a new paragraph (L) to section 1866 (a)(1) of the Act. It requires hospitals
that participate in Medicare to be participating providers under 38 U.S.C. 603, in accordance with the admissions
practices, and payment methodology and amounts, prescribed under joint regulations issued to implement this section
by the Secretary of HHS and the Administrator of the VA. This provision applies to services furnished to veterans admitted
on or after July 1, 1987.

C. Statement of Beneficiary Rights

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9305(b)(1) of OBRA 86, which was enacted on October 21, 1986, added a new paragraph (M) to section 1866(a)(1)
of the Act. That paragraph requires a hospital that is eligible to participate in the Medicare program to agree to furnish
a beneficiary, or an individual acting on his or her behalf, at or about the time of admission, with a written statement
of the beneficiary's discharge rights. The statement must explain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The individual's rights to benefits for inpatient hospital services and for posthospital services under Medicare;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The circumstances under which the individual will and will not be liable for charges for continued stay in the hospital;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The individual's right to appeal denials of benefits for continued inpatient hospital services, including the
practical steps to initiate the appeal; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The individual's liability for services if the denial of benefits is upheld on appeal; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Additional information that the Secretary specifies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9305(b)(2) of OBRA 86 requires that we prescribe the language to be used in the statement not later than 6 months
after the effective date of OBRA 86. After development of the revised language for the statement required under OBRA
86, the hospitals must comply with the requirement to give the revised statement to beneficiaries upon admission.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below is a summary of the current legislative provisions concerning the responsibilities of Medicare participating
hospitals (including rural primary care hospitals) in emergency cases. This legislative summary first sets forth
the major provisions of section 1867 of the Act, as originally enacted by COBRA on April 7, 1986, and including all amendments
that have occurred since that time. The summary then describes separately the amendments made by OBRA 89 and OBRA 90,
which were enacted after the publication of the June 16, 1988, notice of proposed rulemaking.

1. Current Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9121 of COBRA added a paragraph (I) to section 1866(a)(1) of the Act and added a new section 1867 to the Act. As
amended, these sections prohibit hospitals (including rural primary care hospitals) with emergency medical departments
from refusing to treat individuals with unstable emergency medical conditions and also contain provisions designed
to halt the inappropriate transfers of these individuals to other medical facilities.

Section 1866(a)(1)(I) of the Act requires that a hospital participating in the Medicare program must agree to comply
with the requirements of section 1867 of the Act to the extent applicable. Section 1867 of the Act currently provides
the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A hospital with an emergency department must, within the capabilities of its emergency department (including
ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department), provide an appropriate medical screening
examination to any individual who comes to the emergency department for examination or treatment of a medical condition
and on whose behalf the examination or treatment is requested; the purpose of the examination is to determine whether
the individual has an emergency medical condition. This requirement applies regardless of the individual's eligibility
for Medicare benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If an individual, regardless of eligibility for Medicare benefits, has an emergency medical condition, the
hospital must either provide for further examination and treatment (within its capabilities) to stabilize the medical
condition or make an appropriate transfer, with a proper certification, of the individual to another medical facility,
unless the treatment or transfer is refused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A hospital may not transfer an individual unless_

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
&blank;_A physician, or other qualified medical personnel, after consulting with a physician (who later countersigns
the certification because a physician is not physically present in the emergency department), has certified that
the medical benefits expected from the treatment at the receiving facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual
and, in the case of labor, to the unborn child, from effecting the transfer; and

the individual's health and, in the case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In which the receiving facility has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of the individual
and has agreed to accept the transfer and to provide appropriate medical treatment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In which the transferring hospital sends to the receiving facility all appropriate medical records (or copies)
available at the time of transfer that are related to the emergency condition for which the individual has presented
including records related to the individual's emergency medical condition, observation of signs or symptoms, preliminary
diagnosis, treatment provided, results of any tests and informal written consent or certification (or copies),
and the name and address of any on-call physician who has refused or failed to appear within a reasonable time to provide
necessary stabilizing treatment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In which the transfer is effected through qualified personnel and transportation equipment, as required, including
the use of necessary and medically appropriate life support measures during the transfer; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_That meets other requirements as the Secretary may find necessary in the interest of the health and safety of the patient.

&bull;A hospital that fails to meet the requirements of section 1867 of the Act_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Is subject to termination of its Medicare provider agreement if it fails to comply with section 1867; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Is subject to civil monetary penalties if it negligently violates section 1867 of the Act. The penalty cannot
exceed $25,000 for each violation committed between August 1, 1986 (the effective date of the statute) and December
21, 1987, or $50,000 for violations on or after December 22, 1987. (The amount was raised by section 4009(a)(1) of the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 87), Pub. L. 100&hyph;203, effective December 22, 1987.)

&bull;Each physician who is responsible for the examination, treatment or transfer of an individual (including
a physician who is on-call for the care of such individual) is also subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $25,000
for each violation ($50,000 for violations on or after December 22, 1987), including_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The signing of transfer certifications if the physician knew or should have known that the benefits of transfer
did not outweigh the risks, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Misrepresenting an individual's condition or other information, including a hospital's obligations
under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A physician may also be excluded from participation in the Medicare and State health care programs for a violation
that is gross and flagrant or repeated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If a hospital violates the requirements of section 1867 of the Act and a patient suffers personal harm as a direct
result, he or she may, in a civil action against the participating hospital, obtain damages for personal injury under
the law of the State in which the hospital is located and may obtain such equitable relief as is appropriate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Any medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of a participating hospital's violation
of section 1867 of the Act may obtain damages available in a civil action against the participating hospital, under
the law of the State in which the hospital is located, and may obtain such equitable relief as is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No civil action to obtain damages, as described above, may be brought more than 2 years after the date of the violation
with respect to which the action is brought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The following terms are defined for purposes of section 1867 of the Act: ``emergency medical condition,''
``hospital,'' ``participating hospital,'' ``to stabilize,'' ``stabilized,'' and ``transfer.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The provisions of section 1867 of the Act do not preempt any State or local law except where they directly conflict.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Participating hospitals are not to delay a medical screening examination or treatment to ask about an individual's
status or method of payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Participating hospitals with specialized capabilities or facilities are obligated to accept the appropriate
transfer of an individual requiring such services if the hospital has the capacity to treat them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Except when a delay would jeopardize the health and safety of individuals, or when there was no screening examination,
the appropriate PRO will assess whether the individual had an emergency condition that had not been stabilized before
the Office of Inspector General (OIG) imposes a civil monetary penalty or exclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Hospitals are required, among other things, to maintain medical and other records related to individuals
transferred to and from a hospital for a period of 5 years from the transfer date. Each hospital must maintain a list
of on-call physicians available to provide stabilizing treatment. Each hospital must also post a conspicuously
placed sign in its emergency department that lists the individuals' rights regarding their examination and treatment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Hospitals are not to penalize or take an adverse action against a physician or a qualified medical person who
refused to authorize the transfer of an unstabilized individual with an emergency medical condition or against a
hospital employee because the employee reported a violation.

a. OBRA 89 Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Rural primary care hospitals. A new category of provider, rural primary care hospitals, was established (section
6003(g)(3) of OBRA 89). Only facilities currently certified as hospitals and not in violation of any conditions of
participation (42 CFR part 482) could be designated by the Secretary as rural primary care hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Compliance requirements (section 6018 of OBRA 89). Hospitals are required to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Adopt and enforce a policy to ensure compliance with section 1867 of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Maintain medical and other records related to individuals transferred to or from a hospital for a period
of 5 years from the transfer date; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Maintain a list of on-call physicians available for duty to provide treatment needed to stabilize an individual
with an emergency medical condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Posted information (section 6018 of OBRA 89). Participating hospitals must post conspicuously in their emergency
departments_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 +&blank;A sign listing the rights of individuals under section 1867 of the Act regarding examination and treatment
for emergency medical conditions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Information indicating whether the facility participates in the Medicaid program under a State plan approved
under title XIX of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both posted items are to be in a form specified by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Additional requirements for Medicare participating hospitals with emergency departments (section 6211
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA 89). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The medical screening requirement was changed to indicate that the capability of the facility's emergency
department includes ``ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Participating facilities are now required to inform each individual (or a person acting on his or her behalf)
of the risks and benefits to the individual of examination and treatment and/or transfer, and to ``take all reasonable
steps to secure the individual's (or person's) written informed consent to refuse such examination and treatment''
and/or transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Changes were made relating to the restrictions on transfers to include_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_A requirement that participating facilities obtain written requests for transfer to another medical facility
after informing individuals (or legally responsible persons acting on their behalf) of the hospital's obligations
and the risk of transfer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_An explicit statement that there should be consideration of the risks and benefits to unborn children of women in
labor in determining whether the physician should certify that the benefits outweigh the risks of transfer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A requirement that transfer certifications by participating facilities include a summary of the risks and benefits
upon which the certification is based; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A requirement that when a qualified medical person signs the certification, it be done in consultation with a physician
and that the physician later countersign the certification; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A requirement that the hospital provide medical treatment within its capacity to minimize the risks of transfer;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A requirement that the transferring hospital include specified documents in the medical records sent to receiving
hospitals.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Civil monetary penalties (section 6211(e) of OBRA 89). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Physicians, including on-call physicians, are subject to civil monetary penalties and exclusion from
Medicare and the State health care programs for violations of section 1867 of the Act, including_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The signing of transfer certifications if the physician knew or should have known that the benefits of transfer did
not outweigh the risks; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Misrepresenting an individual's condition or other information on the transfer certification.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
+&blank;A participating facility or an on-call physician is subject to a penalty if the on-call physician fails or
refuses to appear within a reasonable period of time when notified by an emergency department physician that his or
her services are needed and the emergency physician orders a transfer because he or she determines that without the
services of the on-call physician the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks of transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Specialty hospitals (section 6211(f) of OBRA 89). Participating hospitals with special capabilities or
facilities are obligated to accept the appropriate transfer of an individual who requires such specialized capabilities
or facilities if the hospital has the capacity to treat the individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;No delay in examination or treatment (section 6211(f) of OBRA 89). Participating hospitals are not to delay
the provision of a medical screening examination, treatment, or both, to inquire about the individual's method of
payment or insurance status.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Whistleblower protections (section 6211(f) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA 89). Participating hospitals may not take action against a physician because he or she refused to authorize the
transfer of an unstabilized individual with an emergency medical condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Definitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The term ``responsible physician'' is no longer used in section 1867(d) of the statute. It was changed to
``a physician who is responsible for the examination, treatment or transfer of an individual'' under section 1867(d)(1)(B)
of the Act. (Section 6211(e)(1) of OBRA 89.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The term ``patient'' was replaced with the term ``individual.'' (Section 6211(g) of OBRA 89.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The term ``emergency medical condition'' now includes a pregnant woman who is having contractions, either
when there is inadequate time to effect safe transfer, or when the transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety
of a pregnant woman or her unborn child. The term ``active labor'' was deleted. (Section 6211(h) of OBRA 89.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The terms ``to stabilize'' and ``stabilized'' now take into account what might occur during a transfer and
explicitly extend the protection of section 1867 of the Act to a pregnant woman until delivery (including the delivery
of the placenta). (Section 6211(h) of OBRA 89.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the provisions described above were effective beginning July 1, 1990, with the exception of the definition
of the term ``rural primary care hospital'', which was effective upon enactment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
b. OBRA 90 Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Civil monetary penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The standard for liability for imposing civil monetary penalties against hospitals and physicians was
changed from ``knowingly'' to ``negligently.'' (Sections 4008(b)(1) and 4027(a)(2) of OBRA 90.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Hospitals with fewer than 100 State-licensed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare-certified beds are subject to a civil monetary penalty of not more than $25,000, while all other hospitals
remain subject to a maximum CMP of $50,000. (Section 4008(b)(2) of OBRA 90.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Termination of hospital provider agreements (section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The provision in section 1867(d)(1) of the Act that subjected violating hospitals to termination or suspension
of their Medicare provider agreements was deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Hospitals are now required, under section 1866(a)(1)(I)(i), to adopt and enforce a policy to ensure compliance
with the requirements of section 1867 in order to participate in and receive payments under the Medicare program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;PRO assessment (section 4027(a)(1) of OBRA 90). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;In considering allegations of violations, before the OIG imposes a sanction, HCFA is required to request
the appropriate PRO (with a contract under part B of title XI) to assess whether the individual involved had an emergency
medical condition that had not been stabilized, except when a delay would jeopardize the health and safety of individuals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;The PRO must provide_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_An assessment of the alleged violation to determine whether the individual involved had an emergency medical condition
that had not been stabilized and a report of the violation to the Secretary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Reasonable notice of the review to the physician and hospital involved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Within the time allotted by the Secretary, reasonable opportunity for the affected physician and the hospital to
discuss the case with the PRO and to submit additional information before the PRO issues its report. The Secretary
will request such a review, except when delay would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals or when there was
no screening examination, before effectuating a sanction. When a delay would not jeopardize the health or safety
of individuals, the PRO will have at least 60 calendar days to complete its review.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Standard for excluding physicians (section 4027(a)(3) of OBRA 90). The standard for excluding physicians,
including on-call physicians, from participation in the Medicare and State health care programs was changed from
``knowing and willful or negligent'' to ``gross and flagrant or is repeated.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Revised whistleblower protections (section 4027(k)(3) of OBRA 90). The prohibition of a hospital from penalizing
or taking adverse action against a physician because he or she refused to authorize the transfer of an unstabilized
individual with an emergency medical condition was extended to protect a qualified medical person. Also, a hospital
is prohibited from taking action against a hospital employee because the employee reported a violation of these requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Drafting errors. We note that the drafters of OBRA 90 misnumbered the section following section 4206, calling
it section 4027. The drafters also misnumbered the subsections of section 4027, so that what should have been section
4027(k) was misnumbered as section 4027(m). The error in misnumbering the subsections was corrected between the
submission of the conference report and the enrolled bill, Pub. L. 101&hyph;508. The error in misnumbering the section
was not corrected, however. Therefore, the correct section numbers at present for the relevant sections of OBRA 90
are 4008(b), 4027(a) and 4027(k)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above provisions were effective May 1, 1991, with the exception of the provisions of section 4027(a)(1), which
were effective February 1, 1991, and the provisions of section 4027(k)(3), which were effective upon enactment.

We proposed to revise &sect;489.20, Basic commitments, to show that a participating Medicare hospital must agree
to participate in the CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA programs and accept payment from the CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA program as payment
in full in accordance with a new &sect;489.25, which incorporates statutory provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In new &sect;489.25, we would require Medicare participating hospitals to be participating providers in the CHAMPUS
and CHAMPVA programs. We proposed to require the hospitals to comply with DoD regulations governing admissions practices
and payment methodology and amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for such services. As noted above, CHAMPUS published a final rule on September 1, 1987, that contains provisions for
the implementation of a DRG-based payment system. We would continue the policy that hospitals participating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA that also participate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Medicare must meet all Medicare conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation. Thus, if CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA have requirements for participating that differ from Medicare's, Medicare's
requirements also would have to be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed to require hospitals to accept payment from CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA programs as payment in full for the services
provided to these beneficiaries (less applicable deductible, patient cost-share, and noncovered items). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we intended to add a new paragraph (11) to &sect;489.53, Terminations by HHS, to show that a hospital that
does not meet the requirements of &sect;489.25 would be subject to possible termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes would apply only to inpatient hospital services furnished to beneficiaries admitted on or after
January 1, 1987.

B. Participation in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To implement section 233 of Pub. L. 99&hyph;576, we proposed to add a new &sect;489.26. Hospitals do not enter into
participation agreements with the Department of Veterans Affairs program as they do if they choose to participate
in the Medicare program or the CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA programs. Instead, the VA authorizes payment for the treatment,
usually on a preadmission basis at a designated hospital that furnishes the service. We proposed to require a Medicare
participating hospital to admit any veteran whose hospitalization is authorized by the VA under 38 U.S.C. 603 (this
includes emergency cases, which may be authorized after admission). The hospital would have to meet the requirements
of 38 CFR Part 17 regarding admission practices and payment methodology and amounts published October 24, 1990 (55
FR 42848). This arrangement would not affect the hospital's need to meet all Medicare hospital conditions of participation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We also proposed to revise &sect;489.20, Basic commitments, to require hospitals to admit veterans whose admission
is authorized under 38 U.S.C. 603 and to meet the requirements of &sect;489.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also proposed to revise &sect;489.53, Termination by HCFA, to show that HHS may terminate any hospital that fails
to meet the requirements of &sect;489.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would apply to inpatient services furnished to veterans admitted on or after July 1, 1987.

C. Statement of Beneficiary Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed to add a new &sect;489.27, to require participating hospitals that furnish inpatient hospital services
to Medicare beneficiaries to give every beneficiary (or individual acting on his or her behalf) at or about the time
of admission the publication ``An Important Message from Medicare.'' We did not specify the contents of the ``Message''
in the proposed rule, as hospitals are not responsible for writing it. We have distributed and will continue to distribute
to hospitals the language of the ``Message'' that they are to use. A copy of the ``Message'' is included as Appendix
I to this interim final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed to require hospitals to obtain a separate signed acknowledgment from the beneficiary attesting to the
receipt of ``An Important Message from Medicare'' and to retain a copy of the acknowledgment. Effective with admissions
on and after March 24, 1986, PROs were required to monitor each hospital to assure that the hospital distributes ``An
Important Message from Medicare'' to all Medicare beneficiaries. Therefore, we proposed to require the hospital
to obtain the beneficiary's separate, signed acknowledgment attesting to the receipt of the ``Message'' and to retain
a copy of the acknowledgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also proposed to revise &sect;489.20, Basic commitments, to show that a hospital must distribute ``An Important
Message from Medicare''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We planned to add a new paragraph (12) to &sect;489.53, Terminations by HHS, to show that a hospital failing to meet
the requirements of &sect;489.27 may be terminated. Whether or not HHS would terminate a provider would depend on
HCFA's judgment as to the scope of the failure and the hospital's correction or plan for correction of the failure.
We did not anticipate any hospital opposition to the requirement that the ``Message'' be distributed. We believe
we already have full cooperation from hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions were to apply only to Medicare admissions beginning after we distributed ``An Important Message from
Medicare''.

D. Hospital Emergency Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revisions to the regulations we proposed on June 16, 1988 would have been revisions and additions to 42 CFR Part
489, Provider Agreements under Medicare, and revisions to 42 CFR Part 1001, Program Integrity_Medicare, and Part
1003, Civil Money Penalties and Assessments. Basically, the proposed provisions paralleled the statutory requirements
that were then in effect. We note that, as discussed above in section II.D. of this preamble, OBRA 89 and OBRA 90 included
amendments to section 1867 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Requirements for Hospitals With Emergency Care Departments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;We proposed to revise &sect;489.20, which discusses basic commitments, by adding a new paragraph to require
hospitals with emergency departments, as part of their participation agreement, to agree to comply with the new &sect;489.24,
which incorporates the statutory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We proposed to add a new section &sect;489.24, Special responsibilities of Medicare hospitals in emergency
cases, to set forth requirements for emergency cases for all hospitals that have provider agreements with Medicare.
We planned to require a hospital to take the following measures: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Medical screening requirement_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For any individual, regardless of his or her eligibility for Medicare, for whom emergency treatment or examination
is requested, we proposed to require a hospital with an emergency department to provide for an appropriate medical
screening examination within the emergency department's capability to determine whether an emergency medical
condition exists or whether the individual is in active labor, as defined below. The examinations would be conducted
by individuals determined qualified by hospital by-laws and who meet the requirements of &sect;482.55, which are
that emergency services be supervised by a qualified member of the medical staff and that there be adequate medical
and nursing personnel qualified in emergency care to meet the written emergency procedures and needs anticipated
by the facility. We proposed to allow hospitals maximum flexibility in their utilization of emergency care personnel
by not including specific requirements concerning education or credentials for individuals conducting emergency
medical examinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Necessary stabilizing treatment for emergency medical conditions and active labor_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the individual has an emergency medical condition or is in active labor, we proposed that the hospital be required
to provide either further medical examination and treatment to stabilize the medical condition or treatment of the
labor or transfer the individual appropriately to another medical facility. We would not hold the hospital responsible
if the individual, or a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf, refuses to consent in writing
to the further examination and treatment or the appropriate transfer to another hospital.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under these provisions, the hospital would be responsible for treating and stabilizing any individual, regardless
of eligibility for Medicare, who presents himself or herself with an emergency condition at the hospital, and for
providing such care until the condition ceases to be an emergency or until the individual is properly transferred
to another facility. We interpreted this to mean, for example, that if a hospital were to admit and then transfer an
individual before his or her condition is stabilized, except as provided below, it would be a violation of section
1867 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Transfers and restrictions_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an individual at a hospital has an emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized or the individual is
in active labor, the hospital could not appropriately transfer the individual unless one of the following conditions
exist: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The individual (or a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf) requests the transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_A physician (or other qualified medical personnel if a physician is not readily available in the emergency department)
has certified in writing that, based upon the reasonable risks and benefits to the individual and the information
available at the time, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment
at the other facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual's medical condition from the transfer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We considered a transfer to be appropriate only if the receiving medical facility has available space and qualified
personnel for the treatment of the individual and has agreed to accept the transfer of the individual and to provide
appropriate medical treatment. The transferring hospital would have to furnish the receiving medical facility
with timely appropriate medical records (for example, copies of the available history, examination, and treatment
records as well as any available reports of diagnostic studies performed). The patient would have to be accompanied
by qualified personnel during the transfer; transportation arrangements would have to include the use of necessary
and medically appropriate life support measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the statute authorized the Secretary to find that the transfer must meet ``other requirements'' in the interest
of the health and safety of individuals transferred, we did not propose to adopt any. We did, however, specifically
invite public comment concerning any ``other requirements'' the Secretary should consider adopting regarding
the health and safety of emergency department patients being transferred between medical facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Definitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed to include in &sect;489.24 the following definitions as included in the statute, without interpretation_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;``Active labor'' means labor at a time when delivery is imminent, there is inadequate time to effect safe
transfer to another hospital before delivery, or a transfer may pose a threat to the health and safety of the patient
or the unborn child. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;An ``emergency medical condition'' means a medical condition manifested by acute symptoms of sufficient
severity (including severe pain) that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to
result in: (a) Placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy; (b) serious impairment to bodily functions; or (c)
serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;``To stabilize'' means, with respect to an emergency medical condition, to provide the medical treatment
of the condition necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of
the condition is likely to result from the transfer of the individual from a facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;``Stabilized'' means, with respect to an emergency medical condition, that no material deterioration
of the condition is likely, within reasonable medical probability, to result from the transfer of an individual from
a facility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
+&blank;``Transfer'' means the movement (including the discharge) of a patient to outside a hospital's facilities
at the direction of any person employed by (or affiliated or associated with, directly or indirectly) the hospital,
but it does not include moving a patient who has been declared dead or who leaves the facility without the permission
of any person responsible for directing transfers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of these definitions, the term ``hospital'' means a Medicare facility certified as a hospital with
its own provider number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We did not plan to define ``participating provider'' in part 489; 42 CFR 400.202 defines terms applicable to all of
42 CFR Chapter IV and already defines ``provider''. A provider by definition agrees to participate in Medicare. We
proposed to add a definition of ``participating hospital'' and the remaining statutory definition, that of ``responsible
physician'', to 42 CFR Chapter V (Parts 1001 and 1003), since these terms are used in conjunction with monetary penalties,
which is under the jurisdiction of the Office of Inspector General. We discuss the proposed definition of ``responsible
physician'' below under ``Civil Monetary Penalties.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We proposed to amend 42 CFR Parts 489, 1001 and 1003 to provide for types of sanctions that would be applied by
the Department, as appropriate_ +&blank;Resolution of allegations and determination of liability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the evidence available establishes that a hospital knowingly and willfully, or negligently, failed to provide
the appropriate screening and treatment or transfer as explained above, it would be subject to either termination
of its provider agreement by HCFA in accordance with section 1866(b) of the Act, or suspension of its provider agreement
by the OIG. In addition, the OIG could also impose civil monetary penalties for knowing violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the Department receives a complaint, or any information or allegation, to the effect that a Medicare hospital
did not appropriately comply with the emergency medical screening, stabilizing, treatment or transfer requirements,
HCFA would, upon receipt of all available information and evidence, conduct sufficient review to determine whether
the complaint falls within the jurisdiction of section 1867. If so, HCFA would consider the complaint a substantial
allegation and would investigate the allegation thoroughly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If complaints allege acts of discrimination in violation of the civil rights laws, HCFA will refer them to the Office
for Civil Rights. In the case of other complaints, HCFA would send each complainant a letter acknowledging receipt
of the complaint, advising him or her of his or her rights to consider independently the civil enforcement provisions
of section 1867 and stating that it will refer the complaint to other agencies if, during the complaint investigation,
it determines that the matter falls under the jurisdiction of other agencies. Thus, HCFA would refer a complaint to
the Office for Civil Rights if it determines that a hospital may be in violation of the Hill-Burton Subpart G Community
Service regulations at 42 CFR 124.603(b)(1), which require Medicare participating hospitals that receive Hill-Burton
construction grants and loans to provide emergency medical services to any person who resides (or, in the case of some
hospitals, works) in the hospital's designated health service area. HCFA would, of course, inform complainants
of the outcome of its investigations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA would notify State Medicaid authorities, State licensing bodies, the Office of Inspector General, appropriate
PROs and the Office for Civil Rights concerning all complaint investigations and all termination actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA would determine whether the hospital knowingly and willfully, or negligently, failed to comply with the requirement
of &sect;489.24 based on evidence of: (a) Inadequate treatment or treatment not being provided; (b) patients in unstable
condition or in active labor not being properly transferred as defined in &sect;489.24(d)(2); (c) the hospital's
actions, or lack of actions, causing a patient's or infant's death or serious or permanent impairment to a patient's
bodily functions; or (d) a hospital's actions placing a patient's health in serious jeopardy. HCFA would determine
the hospital to have been negligent if the hospital and its personnel failed to exercise care that should normally
be supplied to a patient experiencing an emergency medical condition or active labor as defined in &sect;489.24(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Termination of a provider agreement by HCFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA's termination authority under this provision was designed so that quick action may be taken to protect Medicare
beneficiaries and other individuals from any potential harm. The termination of a provider agreement was to be the
initial action contemplated against a hospital that knowingly and willfully, or negligently, failed to meet the
requirements set forth in &sect;489.24. This section would allow for the termination of the hospital's provider
agreement under Medicare in accordance with section 1866(b) of the Act. The termination requirement was to be contained
in &sect;489.24(e). (The authority to terminate has been delegated from HHS through the HCFA Administrator to HCFA
Regional Offices.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA was to revise &sect;489.53, Termination by HCFA, to include in paragraph (b) failure to comply with the requirements
of &sect;489.24 as a mandatory cause for termination of a provider agreement. HCFA would also revise paragraph (c)
to state that, if it determines that a hospital is in violation of &sect;489.24(a) through (d), HCFA would usually
consider the violation to pose an immediate and serious threat to the health and safety of persons presenting themselves
to the hospital for emergency services and would terminate the hospital's approval for Medicare participation within
2 days of the determination unless the violation is corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those instances in which HCFA determined that a hospital was in violation of the requirements of the Act, it would
initiate termination action. When that action was resolved, HCFA would refer the case to the OIG for possible imposition
of civil monetary penalties. If the OIG, upon further investigation, discovered past violations that did not form
the basis of the termination action, it could decide that a sanction is warranted and exercise its authority to impose
a suspension against the reinstated provider. (See the next section.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In instances where HCFA found no violation, and therefore did not take an action, the closed case would still be transmitted
to the OIG. If the OIG, upon reviewing the case file, believed that further case development was warranted, it would
be free to do so. If OIG's investigation indicated that there were additional violations that were not reflected in
HCFA's case file, it would refer the new case information back to HCFA with a recommendation on whether HCFA should
terminate the hospital's provider agreement based on the new findings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whether or not HCFA took a termination action on a given case, all investigated cases were to be referred to the OIG for
possible imposition of civil monetary penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+&blank;Suspension of a provider agreement by the OIG and imposition of civil monetary penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed for the OIG to suspend providers, impose monetary penalties on violators and exclude responsible physicians.
The proposed rule stated that the OIG would not be precluded from suspending a hospital if, upon further investigation,
it determined there were additional violations of section 1867 beyond those warranting the HCFA termination that
indicated a pattern of dumping more widespread than initially believed by HCFA, or that additional instances of dumping
were so egregious that a penalty of suspension was appropriate. In addition, the proposed rule stated that the OIG
could also impose a civil monetary penalty (of not more than $50,000 per violation) for a hospital knowingly violating
the screening, treatment and transfer requirements of the statute and a civil monetary penalty (also of not more than
$50,000) against each responsible physician. The proposed regulations also stated that, in addition to imposing
civil monetary penalties, the OIG may exclude the responsible physician from Medicare participation for up to five
years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress repealed the suspension authority in section 4008(b) of OBRA 90. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Civil enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual who suffers personal harm, or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss, as a direct result of
the hospital's violation of a requirement in &sect;489.24, may bring a civil action, in an appropriate Federal district
court, against the hospital for damages and other equitable relief as appropriate. No civil action may be brought
more than 2 years after the date of the violation. The Federal district court will apply the law of the State in which
the hospital is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We continue to believe that it was neither necessary nor appropriate to revise the regulations to reflect this provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Preemption of State law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislation provides that it does not preempt State or local law except where there is a conflict with the statutory
provision. Since Federal law ordinarily supersedes State law where there is a conflict, it was not necessary to propose
this provision for the regulations.

2. Responsibilities of Hospitals Receiving Improperly Transferred Individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Preliminary findings of a study being conducted by the OIG (``Patient Dumping After COBRA: Assessing the Incidences
and the Perspectives of Health Care Professionals'' (August 1988)) confirmed that a number of individuals in unstable
condition have been transferred improperly and that the cases were not reported to HCFA. Because we needed to know
about all improper transfers, we proposed to add new paragraphs &sect;489.20(g) and &sect;489.24(f) to require
a hospital that suspects it may have received an improperly transferred individual to promptly report the matter
to HCFA and to the State survey agency. To be in compliance with this requirement, the receiving hospital would have
to report any suspected incident within 72 hours of its occurrence; this requirement would appear in manual instructions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also proposed to add material to &sect;489.53(a) to show that failure to report improper transfers may subject
the receiving hospital to termination of its provider agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those instances in which HCFA determines that a hospital is in violation of &sect;489.20(g) and &sect;489.24(f),
we proposed to initiate termination action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. State Survey Agency Responsibilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preliminary findings of the OIG study previously cited also identified incidents of improper transfer being
reported to the State survey agency that were not then reported to HCFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assure that we are aware of all instances of improper transfer, we also proposed to require the State survey agencies
to report promptly any credible complaints (that is, complaints that are specific and detailed enough to be investigated)
related to violations of section 1867 of the Act. Therefore, we intended to revise &sect;405.1903 (recodified as
&sect;488.18), Documentation of findings, by adding a new paragraph (d) that would require State survey agencies
to inform HCFA of credible reports of violations of &sect;489.24.

A. Participation in the CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA and VA Health Care Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received comments from nine commenters concerning the CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA and VA issues. They were from hospitals,
professional organizations and one individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters raised numerous issues relating to the operations of the CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA programs and the operation
of the prospective payment system under those programs (CHAMPVA payments are made under CHAMPUS' DRG-based payment
system). The issues concerned such items as the status of hospitals operating under demonstration programs conducted
by those programs, and the obligation of CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA patients for making cost-share amounts required under
those programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of these regulations is to require hospitals that participate in Medicare to participate as well in the
CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA and VA programs. These regulations do not relate to rules under which those programs function and
do not make any changes in their operations. We have referred questions concerning operational issues to appropriate
administrative officials at OCHAMPUS who assure us that providers who are participating in the CHAMPUS Reform Initiative
area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be forced to accept payment less than the DRG amounts. They also tell us that the adjusted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardized amount used in the CHAMPUS DRG-based payment system contains a factor to reimburse hospitals for CHAMPUS'
share of the hospitals' bad debts. These regulations do not change the beneficiary's obligation to pay required cost-share
amounts.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters stated that the provider's freedom of choice in making management decisions of participating or
not in these additional programs would be taken away by implementing these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislation clearly ties participation in Medicare to acceptance, as well, of the CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA participation
responsibility. We recognize that this change in the law alters the range of discretion that a hospital may have in
selecting participation options but the law offers no alternative to accepting all the programs or declining to participate
in Medicare.

One commenter believed that, as a provider of services to CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA and VA beneficiaries for many years, his
institution has the right to receive a notice of government action and have a chance to respond to the government decision-making.
He received no notice of government action until reading this notice of proposed rulemaking.

Under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553 et seq.), it is the notice of proposed rulemaking that is the vehicle
for providing notice of this type of government action. Should a provider be subject to termination for not being in
compliance with requirements added by this rule, we believe the procedures for termination by HCFA located at &sect;489.53
are fundamentally fair. These procedures include our proposed rules under &sect;489.53(a)(11) that allow HCFA
to terminate an agreement with any provider, if HCFA finds that the provider no longer meets the appropriate conditions
of participation such as those found in new &sect;489.25 or &sect;489.26, which address providing medical services
to CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA or VA beneficiaries. Before we find a hospital in violation, we expect, as discussed in the preamble
of the proposed rule, that efforts to resolve any problem will have taken place. If problems are not resolved then the
actual notice of termination procedures listed in &sect;489.53(c) will be initiated.

Four commenters stated that third party payors, such as Medicaid and CHAMPUS, pay smaller and smaller proportions
of the costs these hospitals incur in serving those covered by these programs. In their view, if hospitals are to continue
to provide full access, then Congress, HCFA, the Department of Defense, and State governments must recognize their
responsibility to adequately finance the care that they require to be provided.

We believe that the prospective payment system results in fair payments. As implemented under Medicare, the prospective
payment system differentiates payments by location and type of provider as well as by the relative resource intensity
of individual cases. The CHAMPUS and VA DRG-payment systems are similar to that used by Medicare; however, they have
been tailored to their own health care utilization patterns. Under a prospective payment system, many of the operational
costs have been factored into the DRG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have been informed that under the CHAMPUS DRG-payment system the cost sharing provisions have been changed to ensure
that the amount of the shared cost incurred by the beneficiary will be more equitable. In fact, we have learned that
most beneficiaries will pay less under this new system than the old, and no beneficiary is expected to pay more in cost
share amounts. As under the Medicare prospective payment system, annual evaluations to recalculate DRG weights
are taking place under the CHAMPUS DRG-based system using the most recent period of CHAMPUS data. During annual evaluations,
consideration can be given to any problems which have surfaced.

and amounts that the VA provides for those hospitals that furnish inpatient hospital care to veterans whose care has
been authorized or will be sponsored by the VA. As noted in section I.B. of this preamble, this rule was developed jointly
by VA and HHS, and the VA payment system conforms to Medicare's inpatient hospital prospective payment system in most
cases.

One commenter believes that, at a minimum, disproportionate share providers should receive special protection.
He stated that since Congress recognized that additional Medicare payments under the prospective payment system
should be made to hospitals that admit a disproportionate share of low-income patients, a similar disproportionate
share status may be necessary to protect Medicare providers located in areas surrounding military bases or other
military installations.

The preamble to the final rule implementing the CHAMPUS DRG-Based Payment System (52 FR 32992) provides information
to suggest that there should not be a disproportionate number of CHAMPUS beneficiaries seeking care in Medicare participating
hospitals (civilian hospitals). Specifically, when discussing ``emergency treatment'' (page 32996, first column),
it states that ``*&blank;*&blank;*all CHAMPUS beneficiaries who live within catchment areas of military treatment
facilities (MTFs) are required to first seek inpatient care at the MTF before going to a civilian hospital*&blank;*&blank;*''
The catchment area is defined as within 40 miles of an MTF. On the other hand, however, we have been informed that CHAMPVA
beneficiaries are not eligible for care in MTFs; therefore, they must use either VA or civilian hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe the payment rates under CHAMPUS are adequate to pay for treatment of its enrolled population. If the commenter
believes otherwise he should furnish the VA with data on this matter and present detailed findings to support the need
for a suggested adjustment to payment rates.

The joint regulations to which the statute refers are regulations establishing payment procedures and amounts,
not regulations requiring participation. Such regulations have already been published (55 FR 42848 for VA and 52
FR 32992 for CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA). In addition, we consulted on these regulations with pertinent members of OCHAMPUS
and VA before publication; thus, these regulations are also a joint action. They are also prospective, not retroactive.

We do not believe that most of these methods would serve the purpose Congress intended. Posting a sign could still result
in many, if not most, beneficiaries not noticing it at all; a mass mailing would be untimely for most patients and thus
subject to being ignored. Moreover, the law requires that the notice be furnished by the hospital. Finally, many admissions
are not planned or occur with little advance notice; so, having the hospital mail the statement before admission would
be a viable method of informing some but not all beneficiaries of their discharge rights on a timely basis. We note,
however, that hospitals may choose this approach with patients whose admissions are planned in advance.

The law is self-implementing; that is, it did not require public comment or regulations in order to be implemented.
However, we did consult extensively with major beneficiary and provider organizations (such as the Gray Panthers,
American Hospital Association, and the American Association of Retired Persons) and have subsequently revised
the final version of ``An Important Message from Medicare'' (the ``Message'') after these consultations.

One commenter stated that the ``Message'' is inadequate, especially as it pertains to discharge planning, and suggested
either a separate notice or an expanded notice to focus on the discharge planning requirements of section 1861(e)(6)
of the Act. Another commenter asserted that the original ``Message'' was poorly written, as it tries to cover legal
requirements. The commenter also asserted that there is a need for the ``Message'' to be more supportive and informative.

The revised ``Message'' contains several references to the availability of hospital discharge planning and the
need to consult a physician or appropriate hospital staff for assistance. Beneficiaries have a current need for the
``Message,'' and we do not believe it would have been appropriate to delay its distribution until after the condition
of participation for discharge planning, proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be included in our regulations at &sect;482.43 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see 53 FR 22506, June 16, 1988), is published as a final rule. Requiring a notice of hospital discharge rights and requiring
hospitals to provide a discharge planning process are two separate statutory provisions of OBRA 86 that were not meant
to be combined. Further, Congress did not specify explicitly in section 1866(a)(1)(M) that discharge planning should
be included in the notice. We have revised the original ``Message'' to improve its readability as well as its content.
We note that it has always been our intention to revise the ``Message'' in the future as patient needs change.

We received four comments, all from beneficiary organizations, in favor of our requirement that the hospital obtain
a signed acknowledgement of the discharge rights notice. We also received 17 comments against it, primarily from
hospitals and hospital organizations. Four of these commenters stated that there is no need for this requirement.
They cited HCFA's statement in the preamble to the proposed rule that, ``we believe we already have full cooperation
from hospitals.''

We strongly believe that the requirement that a hospital furnish a statement concerning discharge rights to each
Medicare beneficiary must be fully met. However, we are persuaded by the commenters that full compliance has already
been achieved in most hospitals. Therefore, we have eliminated the requirement for a signed acknowledgement. In
its place, we now specify under &sect;489.27 that a hospital must be able to demonstrate that it complies with the requirement
that each beneficiary be furnished with a discharge rights notice at or about the time of admission. We note, however,
that signed acknowledgements could be required as part of a plan of correction for a hospital that was found to be out
of compliance with this requirement.

In conjunction with the elimination of the signed acknowledgement requirement, we have deleted the accompanying
retention requirement from this interim final rule. When we published the proposed rule, our PRO program was oriented
towards review of hospital medical records, and so we chose initially to implement the discharge rights requirement
specifically in terms of an acknowledgement in the medical record. More recently, however, we have reoriented our
PRO program towards efforts more likely to bring about general improvements in quality and have minimized our funding
of more limited ``process'' requirements such as review of individual medical records. Accordingly, we recognize
that the proposed acknowledgement and retention requirements have become obsolete and are eliminating them. Again,
the final rule does require hospitals to demonstrate compliance with the discharge rights notification requirement,
but does not specify the manner of compliance. We expect some hospitals may continue to seek and retain signed acknowledgements
but believe they should have other, less burdensome, options as well.

Eight commenters believed that this requirement would be a burden on the beneficiary and his or her family as there
are already too many forms to complete at admission; one commenter felt that securing a signed acknowledgement would
do little to improve beneficiary attention to the ``Message'' because it is the presence of a problem, rather than
the presence of the notice, that generates beneficiary attention to discharge rights issues.

We realize that being admitted to a hospital is a stressful event for patients and their families. As noted above, we
have removed the requirement for a signed and dated acknowledgement, in part because of its impact on beneficiaries.

In addition to the concerns discussed above, commenters also addressed specific aspects of the requirement that
hospitals obtain and retain signed acknowledgement statements. For example, one commenter suggested that we require
that the date and time of the patient's signature on the acknowledgement statement be recorded; another recommended
that the acknowledgement statement be accompanied by an additional statement that signing the acknowledgement
in no way compromises a patient's discharge rights; another suggested that the acknowledgement specify that the
beneficiary has been given the name of an individual at the hospital who is available to explain the ``Message.'' Similarly,
commenters asked that we specify where, in what form, and for how long acknowledgements be retained. Finally, several
commenters recommended that we allow hospitals as much flexibility as possible in implementing the acknowledgement
and retention requirements.

Given that we have decided to eliminate the requirement for a signed acknowledgement and its retention, most of these
comments are now moot. Thus, we agree with the commenters who believe that hospitals should be given maximum flexibility
in determining how they can best comply with the requirement that all beneficiaries be furnished with a notice of discharge
rights. We do not intend to specify the actual mechanics of having this notice presented to patients. Instead, we expect
individual hospitals to exercise their own discretion in dealing with the associated administrative issues. We
emphasize that, for survey purposes, hospitals that do not choose to obtain and retain signed acknowledgement statements
must be able to document compliance by some other means with the requirement for timely distribution of the discharge
rights notice.

We do not agree that the regulations themselves should address these situation. Such situations will be relatively
rare. Hospitals will need to be in compliance with applicable State statutes in dealing with informing patients who
cannot receive information on their own behalf. Program instructions are a more appropriate vehicle for discussing

HCFA carries out a variety of activities to educate beneficiaries and will continue to do so. However, section 1866(a)(1)(M)
of the Act requires that this explanation of patient rights be provided by the hospital. This is an appropriate hospital
responsibility since inpatient hospital care is under the control of the hospital and the patient looks to the hospital
for information about rights and options concerning care. Also, these rights are related to discharge planning,
which is most appropriately a hospital function.

Although a hospital may be terminated for failing to meet our requirements we will not institute termination before
providing an opportunity for correction. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the speed with which we move
to termination would depend on HCFA's judgment as to the scope of the failure and the hospital's correction or plan
for correction of the failure. This approach will be reflected in implementing program instructions.

C. Hospital Responsibility for Emergency Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received comments from 68 commenters on the anti-dumping provisions as they existed before the passage of OBRA
89. Commenters included hospitals, professional health organizations, State hospital associations and medical
societies, State agencies, physicians, attorneys and other individuals. We have taken into account the OBRA 89 and
OBRA 90 statutory changes when responding to the comments we received, and we are adding the OBRA 89 and OBRA 90 requirements
to this interim final rule. We are doing this without publishing a second notice of proposed rulemaking pertaining
to the OBRA 89 and OBRA 90 requirements because we believe the extensive detail of the statute makes many provisions
self-executing and because commenters suggested changes similar to many of those embodied in the legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Please note that, with respect to the anti-dumping provisions, the statute now uses the term ``individual'' and
not ``patient.'' While our response to comments refers to ``individuals,'' we have not made the parallel change when
the term ``patient'' appears in a commenter's statement.)

A number of commenters suggested that HCFA require hospitals to post signs in their emergency departments advising
patients of the hospital's obligation to provide emergency care. Two other commenters recommended that we require
emergency room personnel to give emergency room patients both written and oral notice of the hospital's obligations
and the patient's rights under these regulations.

The provisions of section 1867 of the Act address what is appropriate performance on the part of hospitals in meeting
medical needs of individuals who need emergency services. Additionally, as amended by section 6018(a)(2) of OBRA
89, section 1866(a)(1)(N)(iii) of the Act explicitly directs the Secretary to require Medicare participating hospitals
to post conspicuously in all emergency departments a sign (in a form specified by the Secretary) specifying rights
of individuals under section 1867 of the Act with respect to examination and treatment for emergency medical conditions
and women in labor. Further, since some hospitals do not have traditional emergency departments, we are amending
&sect;489.20 to include a new paragraph (q)(1) to reflect this statutory requirement and to specify other hospital
areas in which such signs should be posted. It should be noted that Medicare participating hospitals that do not offer
emergency services do not have to comply with this requirement. However, all hospitals do have to comply with the provision
of section 1866(a)(1)(N)(iv) of the Act, as also amended by section 6018(a)(2) of OBRA 89, that directs hospitals
to post conspicuously (in a form specified by the Secretary) information indicating whether or not the hospital participates
in the Medicaid program under a State plan approved under title XIX. (See &sect;489.20(q)(2).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have also published an interim manual instruction (IMI)(IM&hyph;90&hyph;1, June 1990) in HCFA Pub. 10, the Medicare
Hospital Manual, listing minimum criteria for the signs and an example of language for this sign that would meet such
criteria. We are including the IMI language as shown in the IMI exhibit for informational purposes in Appendix II to
this final rule and request comments on the exhibit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the statutory requirement for the posting of signs, which does not also require individual written
or oral notice, is adequate for the general purpose of informing patients of their rights to a medical screening and
stabilizing treatment under the anti-dumping statute. This is consistent with the overall drafting of section 1867
of the Act, which specifically requires individual notice in other situations such as consent to transfer. Accordingly,
when an individual's specific treatment is involved, we agree with the commenters that it is essential for patients
to be fully informed about all the critical medical issues with which they are faced. That is why we require a more detailed
process for ensuring that hospitals obtain the informed consent of an individual who is faced with the prospect of
a transfer. (See &sect;489.24(c).) In such cases, we agree that both oral and written interaction are necessary.

A number of commenters objected to our proposal concerning furnishing emergency services on the grounds that our
rule applies to all patients (rather than Medicare patients only). They believe that any problems were of limited
scope and noted that implementation of the requirement will establish an adversarial relationship among HCFA, providers,
and patients.

The protections of the statute are expressly extended to all individuals who come to a facility regardless of whether
the individual is eligible for benefits under Medicare. The Federal Government has always viewed that a provider's
obligation is to all persons, regardless of entitlement. This obligation has been well understood and universally
applied to all providers. Congress, in apparent awareness of this universal obligation, has in some instances limited
the scope of a provider's obligation. An example of this is discharge planning, as provided under section 1861(ee)
of the Act, which limits the scope of this requirement specifically to individuals covered under the Act. Since Congress
has not chosen to narrow the scope of section 1867 by limiting it only to persons entitled to benefits under the Act,
we are confident that the provisions of section 1867 of the Act extend to all persons.

We believe that section 1867 of the Act also applies to all individuals who attempt to gain access to the hospital for
emergency care. An individual may not be denied services simply because the person failed to actually enter the facility's
designated emergency department. To read the statute in such a narrow fashion would in our view frustrate the objectives
of the statute in many cases and lead to arbitrary results. For the same reason, a facility may not prevent an individual
from gaining access to the facility in order to circumvent these requirements. If an individual is on a facility's
property, which includes ambulances owned and operated by the facility, even if the ambulance is not on hospital property,
and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, we believe the
statute reasonably requires the facility to provide a screening examination and treatment or transfer in accordance
with section 1867 of the statute. An individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance on hospital property is considered
to have come to the hospital's emergency department. However, an individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance located
off hospital property is not considered to have come to the hospital's emergency department if someone staffing the
ambulance contacts the hospital by telephone or telemetry communications and informs the hospital that they want
to transport the individual to the hospital for examination and treatment. This is in accordance with the recent court
decision that, for purposes of section 1867 of the Act, a hospital-operated telemetry system is distinct from the
same hospital's emergency department. (See

1992 U.S. App. Lexis 25096 (7th Cir. 1992).) Thus, the hospital may deny such access when it is in ``diversionary''
status because it does not have the staff or facilities to accept any additional emergency patients at that time. However,
if the ambulance disregards the hospital's instructions and does bring the individual on to hospital grounds the
hospital cannot deny the individual access to hospital services whether or not the hospital is in ``diversionary''
status.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters noted that these requirements could have a greater impact on some hospitals than on others.
For example, rural hospitals would have a greater recordkeeping burden in documenting transfers because they have
smaller emergency room (ER) staffs; hospitals with high ER rates for non-Medicare or Medicaid patients would have
to provide care for which these programs will not directly compensate, and some hospitals will have to accept larger
numbers of indigent patients presenting themselves for treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The law specifically applies to all hospitals that participate in Medicare and that offer emergency services. We
have, therefore, inserted the following definition in &sect;489.24(b): ``Hospital with an emergency department
means a hospital that offers services for emergency medical conditions (as defined in this paragraph) within its
capability to do so.'' It is also clear that the statute only requires hospitals that offer emergency services to provide
screening and stabilizing treatment within the scope of their capabilities (sections 1867(a) and (b) of the Act).
We acknowledge, however, that any participating hospital providing emergency services, regardless of size or patient
mix, must provide screening and stabilizing treatment, as needed, to individuals who present themselves for examination
or treatment. We recognize that this could create uneven uncompensated care burdens on some hospitals because of
larger than usual concentrations of indigent patients; however, we do not believe that this will often be the case.
Since the requirements apply to all 6,700 Medicare participating hospitals, among 7,000 U.S. hospitals offering
emergency services, we also believe that the statute will lighten the burden on some hospitals now subject to increased
patient loads due to inappropriate transfers because patients are more likely to be treated and stabilized at the
hospitals where they first present themselves for treatment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters stated that a hospital should not be required to designate in its by-laws which personnel are qualified
to perform the initial medical screening examination because it is unreasonable to require a hospital to amend its
by-laws. A recommendation was made that those personnel qualified to perform screening examinations be approved
by the medical director of the emergency department. Another recommendation was made that those personnel qualified
to perform screening examinations be set forth in the rules and regulations governing the medical staff and not the
by-laws.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is important to require the hospital to determine formally what type of personnel is qualified to perform the initial
medical screening examinations because such a formal determination will insure that the hospital's governing body
recognizes the ``capability of the hospital'' and is properly accountable for this function. For this reason, we
believe that the delegation should be set forth in a document that is approved by the governing body of the hospital,
rather than merely allowing the medical director of the emergency department to make what may be informal delegations
that could frequently change. If the rules and regulations are approved by the board of trustees or other governing
body, we agree that those personnel qualified to perform these examinations may be set forth in the rules and regulations,
instead of placing this information in the hospital by-laws. We are amending &sect;489.24(a) to reflect this change.
Although we are requiring the hospital to specify in its by-laws or its rules and regulations who is a ``qualified medical
person'' for purposes of providing an appropriate medical screening examination, this does not mean that HHS must
accept the hospital's specification when determining whether an appropriate medical screening examination was
done. So, for example, if a hospital specifies that a nurse is always the ``qualified medical person'' who should do
the medical screening examination, HHS may, in some instances, determine that there was not an appropriate medical
screening examination because the condition of the individual required the expertise of a physician to determine
whether that individual had an emergency medical condition.

We have included this language in the regulations at &sect;489.24(c)(3). However, we note that we believe that it
means hospitals may continue to follow reasonable registration processes for emergency room individuals, including
requesting information about insurance, as long as these procedures do not impede provision of necessary treatment
and as long as all individuals to whom the procedures apply are treated similarly. That is, all individuals who have
an emergency medical condition are served regardless of the answers they may give to insurance questions asked during
routine admissions screening. A hospital should not delay treatment to any individual while it verifies information
provided.

 Section 1867(a) of the Act provides that a hospital must give an appropriate medical screening examination to all
individuals who come to the emergency department and request examination or treatment. While it may be prudent for
a hospital to require a physician to conduct this screening examination in every instance, there may be hospitals,
especially rural primary care hospitals, in which a physician is not available to provide a medical screening examination.
Even when physicians are present in the hospital, there may be circumstances that are so clearly not emergency medical
conditions that other qualified medical personnel may conduct the initial screening examination. However, although
it is up to the hospital to determine under what circumstances a physician is required to perform an appropriate medical
screening examination, that does not mean that HHS must accept the hospital's determination of what circumstances
require that the screening exam be performed by a physician.

 It is impossible to define in advance all of the circumstances in which an individual may come to a hospital emergency
department. What constitutes an appropriate medical screening examination will vary according to the condition
and past history of the individual and the capabilities of the hospital's emergency department_both its facilities
and available personnel. Within those capabilities, the examination must be sufficient to permit the hospital to
decide whether or not the individual has an emergency medical condition. Because the law does not require hospitals,
among which there are variations in staffing and procedures, to adopt standard procedures or use standard staffing
to meet these requirements, determinations about whether a hospital is in compliance with these regulations must
be based on the facts in each individual case.

 The regulations presently allow a hospital to delegate its responsibility to perform initial medical screening
examinations to qualified medical personnel if it does so in its by-laws or in its rules and regulations. Such a delegation
must also be consistent with the provisions of &sect;482.55 with respect to emergency services personnel. Obviously,
the Department cannot anticipate every situation in which an individual with an emergency medical condition may
come to an emergency department. Hence, we cannot state unequivocally that an examination by a nurse or other non-physician
medical personnel will be appropriate under all circumstances.

 No revision is necessary. A hospital is only required to treat individuals with the staff and facilities available
at the hospital. Under &sect;482.55(b)(2), a hospital must have available ``adequate medical and nursing personnel
qualified in emergency care to meet the written emergency procedures and needs anticipated by the facility.'' Subject
to the discussion below concerning on-call physicians, if the hospital does not have at its disposal the personnel
or equipment necessary to stabilize a particular person's emergency medical condition, section 1867(c)(1) of the
Act permits an unstabilized individual to be transferred if (a) the individual or the individual's representative
has been informed of the risks and benefits of the transfer and requests the transfer in writing; or (b) the individual
has not refused an appropriate transfer and the physician signs a written certification that the benefits of appropriate
treatment at another facility outweigh the risks associated with the transfer.

 One commenter recommended that the services of on-call physicians should be considered in determining the capabilities

may be necessary to stabilize the emergency medical condition or treat the labor. Another asked that the regulations
specify that a hospital is deemed to be capable of providing emergency services in all fields in which the hospital

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree that on-call physicians and ancillary services should be considered available to the hospital. This was
further clarified in section 6018(a)(1) of OBRA 89, which amended section 1866(a)(1) of the Act to require hospitals
to maintain a list of physicians who are on call and available to provide treatment needed to stabilize individuals
with emergency medical conditions. Accordingly, we have amended &sect;489.20 to include a new paragraph (r)(2)
requiring hospitals to comply with this OBRA 89 provision. The statute (as revised by COBRA, OBRA 89, and OBRA 90) and
the current regulations state that the hospital must provide a medical screening examination, within the capability
of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department,
to determine if the patient has an emergency medical condition. If a hospital chooses to meet its responsibility under
&sect;482.55 to provide adequate medical personnel to meet its anticipated emergency needs by using on-call physicians
either to staff or to augment its emergency department, then the capability of its emergency department includes
the services of its on-call physicians. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute (as revised by COBRA, OBRA 89, and OBRA 90) and current regulations also require the hospital to provide
whatever further examination and treatment are necessary to stabilize the medical condition or to provide for treatment
of the labor within the staff and facilities available at the hospital. If a staff physician is on call to provide emergency
services or to consult with an emergency room physician in the areas of his or her expertise, that physician would be
considered to be available at the hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also believe that when COBRA was enacted, Congress intended that the resources of the hospital and the staff generally
available to patients at the hospital would be considered available for the examination and treatment of individuals
coming to the hospital's emergency department, regardless of whether staff physicians had heretofore been obligated
by the hospital to provide services to those coming to the hospital's emergency department. This was also clarified
by section 6211(a) of OBRA 89, which specifies that the capability of hospital emergency departments must include
``ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department.'' Therefore, if a hospital has a department
of obstetrics and gynecology, the hospital is responsible for adopting procedures under which the staff and resources
of that department are available to treat a woman in labor who comes to its emergency department.

 Neither the statute nor the regulations mandate that hospitals expand their resources or offer more services. Rather,
they focus on a hospital's existing capabilities. The thrust of the statute is that a hospital that offers emergency
services to some members of a community who need their emergency services (for example, those that can pay) cannot
deny such services to other members of the community with a similar need.

As previously indicated, the statute and the regulations specifically state that the hospital must provide treatment
that is within the capabilities of the staff and facilities it has available. If a hospital does not have the capability
to treat psychiatric disorders or a small rural hospital lacks the staff or resources to treat certain emergencies,
it must determine whether the benefits to an individual's medical condition outweigh the risks associated with transferring
the individual. If a physician certifies that the benefits of transfer to a more suitable facility outweigh the risks,
the hospital may transfer the individual to a facility that has the capability to treat that individual and agrees
to accept transfer. The certification may be signed by a qualified medical person if a physician is not physically
present in the emergency department and that qualified medical person first consults with a physician who later countersigns
the certification. Also, a person seeking medical treatment may make an informed decision to request transfer to
such a facility.

 Any participating hospital that offers emergency services is liable for violations of the statute regardless of
whether it is a small rural hospital or a major metropolitan tertiary care facility with a trauma center. The statute
requires any subject hospital to provide for treatment within the capabilities of the staff and facility it has available.
However, hospitals with fewer than 100 State-licensed, Medicare-certified beds are subject to a maximum civil monetary
penalty of $25,000, as compared to a maximum civil monetary penalty of $50,000 for hospitals with 100 or more State-licensed,
Medicare-certified beds.

 The statute and these regulations apply only to hospitals that participate in the Medicare program and that offer
emergency services. HHS considers any participating hospital that provides emergency services to have an emergency
department and thus to be subject to the provisions of the statute and these regulations. However, even a Medicare
participating hospital that does not provide emergency services must continue to meet the standard of &sect;482.12(f),
which requires hospitals to have written policies and procedures for appraisal of emergencies, initial treatment,
and referral where appropriate. Also, to our knowledge, college infirmaries are not hospitals having Medicare provider
agreements and are thus not subject to section 1867 of the Act.

 One commenter noted that in the proposed regulations and COBRA, the term ``hospital'' is defined as ``a Medicare facility
certified as a hospital with its own provider number.'' The commenter recommended that the definition be expanded
to require that the transfer be made to the ``nearest appropriate facility'' that happens to be a Medicare provider,
so that Medicare providers will be required to receive transfers from other hospitals.

 The intent of the statute is to provide equal treatment for all individuals who come to a hospital and request a medical
screening examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition, as well as to provide for protected transfers
of individuals who have unstabilized emergency medical conditions. Such individuals are at the greatest risk of
severe physical impairment, dysfunction, or delivery of a baby in the absence of immediate medical attention. We
believe that after assessing an individual's medical condition and weighing the risks versus benefits of effectuating
an appropriate transfer to another facility, the amount of travel time required to transport the individual should
be considered. Situations will occur where an individual's condition requires a hospital to effectuate a transfer
to the nearest appropriate facility that has the capability and capacity to treat in order to minimize the risks to
the individual by reducing the transportation time as much as possible. Transfer of an unstabilized patient to a hospital
with which there is a prior transfer agreement can be justified when the condition of the unstabilized individual
is such that the additional travel time would not increase the danger to the patient.

 Two commenters believe that we should define emergency department to include the provision of emergency services,
as not all hospitals have a formal ``emergency department.''

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe that section 1867 of the Act applies to all Medicare participating facilities that offer emergency services.
It was not Congress' intent to limit the scope of the provision to only those facilities that have organized areas specifically
labelled as emergency departments or emergency rooms. If so, a facility could easily circumvent its responsibilities
under the Act simply by renaming the department to something other than ``emergency department'' or by using an approach
other than departmentalization in providing hospital services. This would clearly contravene the underlying principle
of the statute that obligates hospitals to render emergency care within their capacity when they normally undertake
to render such care in individual cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, many psychiatric hospitals do not have organized emergency departments. However, many of these facilities
offer 24-hour psychiatric services on a walk-in basis for persons who are not patients of the hospital. Although these
hospitals do not have organized emergency departments, they are presenting themselves to the public as providing
care for psychiatric emergencies. We believe this type of facility must comply with the requirements of section 1867
of the Act and render emergency care within their capability to do so (or provide for a transfer in accordance with section
1867(c) of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to clarify this issue, we believe it is helpful if the regulations define the term ``hospital with an emergency
department'' to clarify which hospitals are subject to the requirements of section 1867. Therefore, as we previously
indicated, we have inserted in &sect;489.24(b) the definition of a hospital with an emergency department.

 One commenter stated that proposed &sect;489.24(c) (2) and (3) are inconsistent in that an individual's refusal
to consent to treatment must be in writing, but a refusal to consent to transfer does not. Other commenters urged HCFA
to require that refusals to consent to treatment be in writing and that they reflect that the individual, or a legally
responsible person acting on his or her behalf, understands the hospital's obligations under the statute and is aware
of the risks of refusing treatment.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree that the decision to refuse or consent to treatment must be an informed one, and we believe that the hospital
is obliged to inform the individual (or the person requesting examination or treatment on his or her behalf) of the
reasonably foreseeable risks and benefits of refusing or consenting to treatment. Sections 6211(b) (1) and (2) of
OBRA 89 amended section 1867(b) of the Act to require hospitals to inform individuals (or persons acting on their behalf)
of the risks and benefits to the individual of examination and treatment and/or transfer, and to ``take all reasonable
steps to secure the individual's (or person's) written informed consent to refuse such examination and treatment,''
transfer, or both. We are therefore amending &sect;489.24(c) (2) and (4) to comply with these OBRA 89 requirements.
Thus, the medical record should contain a description of the examination and treatment offered to the individual.
We also believe that hospitals should not attempt to coerce individuals into making judgments against their best
interest by informing them that they will have to pay for their care if they remain, but that their care will be free or
at low cost if they transfer to a charity hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that hospitals generally require an individual's consent to treatment to be in writing. (See
&sect;482.24(c)(2)(v) requiring properly executed informed consent forms for procedures and treatments specified
by hospital medical staff or Federal or State law requirements.)

 We agree and, based upon this comment and section 6211(c)(1) of OBRA 89, are revising &sect;489.24(d)(1)(ii)(A)
to provide that requests for transfer must be in writing and signed by the individual requesting the transfer or by
a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf. The requests should contain a brief statement of
the hospital's obligations under the statute and the benefits and risks that were outlined to the person signing the
request. The request should be made a part of the patient's medical record, and a copy of it should be sent to the receiving
facility along with the individual transferred. It is reasonable to conclude that, by permitting requests for transfer
to be made only by the individual or a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf, Congress intended
requests to be documented in the manner suggested by the commenter. Moreover, this requirement will reduce litigation
about whether an individual requested the transfer.

Three commenters suggested we specify in the regulations what constitutes a certification that a transfer is in the
patient's best interests. They asked if an entry in the patient's medical record would be sufficient certification.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before an unstabilized individual may be transferred in the absence of a request for transfer, the statute requires
a physician to sign a certification that based upon the information available at the time, the medical benefits reasonably
expected from appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual
and, in the case of labor, to the unborn child, from effecting the transfer. If a physician is not physically present
in the emergency department at the time of transfer, a qualified medical person may sign the certification after consulting
with a physician who later countersigns that certification. Section 1867(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii) of the Act, both
as added by COBRA (section 9121(b)) and revised by OBRA 89 (section 6211(c)(4)), requires an express written certification
by a physician or other qualified medical personnel attesting to the elements just delineated; the certification,
while it may be written explicitly into the medical record, cannot simply be inferred from the findings in the medical
record and the fact that the individual was transferred.

A hospital may violate [the certification] provision in four ways. First, before transfer, the hospital might fail
to secure the required signature from the appropriate medical personnel on a certification form. But the statute
requires more than a signature; it requires a signed certification. Thus, the hospital also violates the statute
if the signer has not actually deliberated and weighed the medical risks and the medical benefits of transfer before
executing the certification. Likewise, the hospital fails to make the certification required by 42 U.S.C. 1395dd(c)(1)(A)(ii)
if the signer makes an improper consideration a significant factor in the certification decision. Finally a hospital
violates the statute if the signer actually concludes in the weighing process that the medical risks outweigh the
medical benefits of transfer, yet signs a certification that the opposite is true.

Section 1867(d)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, as amended by section 6211(e) of OBRA 89, now allows imposition of civil monetary
penalties if the physician ``knew or should have known that the benefits did not outweigh the risks.'' We are therefore
revising &sect;489.24(d)(1)(ii)(B) to require that a certification state the reasons for the transfer and include
a summary of the risks and benefits upon which it is based. As the statute requires that a physician or other qualified
medical personnel in consultation with a physician weigh the benefits and risks associated with the transfer before
an unstabilized individual may be transferred, it should not be unduly burdensome for the physician or other medical
personnel to state the risks and benefits that have been weighed. It should be noted, however, that, under the statute,
the physician, not the qualified medical personnel, makes the transfer determination in all cases. The narrative
rationale need not be a lengthy discussion of the individual's medical condition reiterating facts already contained
in the medical record, but it should give a complete picture of the benefits to be expected from appropriate care at
the receiving facility and the risks associated with the transfer, including the time away from an acute care setting
necessary to effect the transfer.

Revised &sect;489.24(d)(2)(iii) (formerly a part of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)) requires that the certification be
included in the individual's medical record and that it be sent to the receiving hospital along with the transferred
individual. We believe that this will assist the receiving hospitals in determining whether the individual was transferred
appropriately under the statute.

We see no need to revise these medical record requirements of the regulation. Records must accompany an individual
whether or not his or her condition is stabilized. Under &sect;489.24(d)(2)(iii) (formerly paragraph (d)(2)(ii)),
hospitals transferring unstabilized individuals must provide the receiving facility with all medical records
related to the emergency condition for which the individual has presented in addition to other information required
by the statute and regulations. Under the current conditions of participation for hospitals (&sect;482.21(b)(2)),
all patients, including stabilized patients being discharged from hospitals to other facilities and agencies,
must be accompanied by necessary medical information. This is a routine requirement that was in place before the dumping

We agree with this comment, and section 6211(d)(2) of OBRA 89 amended section 1867(c)(2)(C) of the Act to address this
issue. The statute now directs transferring hospitals to send receiving hospitals all medical records related to
the individual's emergency condition ``available at the time of transfer'' (note next Comment and Response) and
specifically lists some of the information that should be included in these records. We have, therefore, amended
proposed &sect;489.24(d)(2)(ii) (now paragraph (d)(2)(iii)) to reflect the new legislative requirements. The
conditions of participation in &sect;482.24(c) contain other Federal requirements relating to medical records.
To the extent that services are performed before transfer we expect them to be reflected in the records transferred,
consistent with the conditions of participation. Although it may be desirable, depending on the patient's condition,
to send along records of previous admissions, the patient's transfer should not be delayed.

We agree with both points, and we have amended proposed &sect;489.24(d)(2)(ii) (now paragraph (d)(2)(iii)) accordingly
to require that a transferring hospital send with the transferred individual whatever records (including copies
of results of diagnostic studies or telephone reports of the studies) are available at the time and place of the transfer.
If a transfer is in an individual's best interests, it should not be delayed until records are retrieved or test results
come back from the laboratory. Whatever documents are available at the time the individual is transferred should
be sent to the receiving hospital with the individual. Test results that become available after the individual is
transferred should be telephoned to the receiving hospital. Records that become available after the patient is transferred,
such as hard copies of test results or relevant records of earlier admissions, for example, should be sent to the receiving
hospital as expeditiously as possible.

The regulations require hospitals to determine which of their personnel are qualified to certify, in consultation
with a physician who later countersigns, that a transfer is appropriate. This decision will vary among hospitals
and States as availability, qualifications, and practice limitations of a particular category of staff differ.
HCFA holds the governing body of a hospital responsible for assuring that its staff functions within the bounds of
State law and this and other federal health and safety regulations. Based upon these comments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 6211(c)(2)(D) of OBRA 89, we are amending &sect;489.24(d)(1)(ii)(C) to specify that, if a physician is not
physically present in the emergency department at the time an individual is transferred, a qualified medical person
may sign a certification stating that the transfer is in the individual's best interest. However, the qualified medical
person may sign a transfer certification only after a physician, in consultation with the qualified medical person,
has made the determination to transfer. The physician must subsequently countersign the certification. The regulation
also provides that the hospital must determine who are ``other qualified medical personnel.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wanted us to recognize that requiring trained emergency medical technicians to accompany a patient
being transferred will meet the requirements that a transfer be effected through ``qualified personnel'' as required
under proposed &sect;489.24(d)(2)(iii) (now paragraph (d)(2)(iv)) because, in many communities, transfers are
made by volunteer rescue squads with trained emergency medical technicians.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We cannot state unequivocally that emergency medical technicians are ``qualified personnel'' for purposes of transferring
an individual under these regulations. Depending on the individual's condition, there may be situations in which
a physician's presence, or some other specialist's presence, might be mandatory.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter proposed that we amend the regulations to clarify that the hospital is responsible for providing transportation
services, either directly or indirectly, stating that the proposed regulations did not address the need for the hospital
to provide transportation services to carry out the physician's orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree. The statute (section 1867(c)(2)(C) of the Act) imposes a duty on the hospital to ensure that the transfer
is effected through qualified personnel and transportation equipment. Frequently the determination of what equipment
and personnel will be required will be a medical decision. The hospital by-laws, rules and regulations, or State law
may dictate that the decision be made by the transferring physician. If the hospital delegates its duty under the statute
to the transferring physician, both the hospital and physician would be obligated to ensure that the transfer is effected
through qualified personnel and necessary equipment. To say that the hospital is ultimately responsible for ensuring
that the transfer is appropriately effected is not, however, to dictate the means by which it meets that responsibility.
Neither the statute nor the regulations requires a hospital to operate an emergency medical transport service. To
this extent, the hospital may meet its obligations as it sees fit; however, that does not mean HHS must accept the hospital's
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also note that with regard to the general area of transportation, although no specific comments were received concerning
``transportation equipment'', the term has now been interpreted to include all physical objects reasonably medically
necessary for safe patient transfer.

934 F.2d 1362, 1373 (5th Cir. 1991). We agree with this interpretation. To limit the appropriate transfer requirement
to just that equipment that is necessary and medically appropriate for life support measures is too narrow an interpretation.

Five commenters wrote in response to our request for comments concerning the ``other requirements'' the Secretary
may find necessary in the best interests of transferred patients' health and safety. They recommended that we require
the use of a standardized memorandum of transfer to be sent with every transferred patient to be signed by both transferring
and receiving physicians and to include information regarding the patient's medical condition, treatment received
and reasons for transfer. One of the commenters also recommended that calls between hospitals requesting transfers
be tape recorded.

Another commenter suggested that the certification requirement in proposed &sect;489.24(d)(1)(i)(B) (now &sect;489.24(d)(1)(ii)(B))
be made a part of a standard transfer form. The commenters believed these suggestions would educate hospital personnel,
provide a record for enforcement of the statute, help assure that the receiving physicians receive appropriate medical
information for each patient, and deter patient dumping.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that the requirements for requests for transfer, certification, and the sending of medical records are
sufficient to provide the information necessary for the receiving hospital to treat the individual and to detect
inappropriate transfers in order to fulfill its reporting requirement. While a memorandum of transfer might provide
a useful summary, we do not believe it is necessary in light of our other requirements. Also note the earlier Comment
and Response concerning another recommendation for the use of memoranda of transfer. Hospitals that frequently
receive inappropriate transfers may choose to document their transfers by tape recording telephone requests in
accordance with applicable State laws; however, we believe it both costly and impractical to require all hospitals
to invest in technology to document transfer circumstances verbatim in this way. In addition, since these additional
requirements would need to be adopted through the rulemaking process and the Secretary has not elected to establish
further requirements in this regulation, we are not including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this final rule the language in proposed &sect;489.24(d)(2)(iv) concerning other requirements to avoid the implication
that there may be additional requirements not included in this regulation.

One commenter raised the issue of whether all transfers must be appropriately made (that is, effectuated) or whether
the rules governing appropriateness applied only to a physician-directed transfer.

All transfers must be effectuated appropriately and the statute and regulations already make this point. It is true
that an individual may demand a transfer that the physician does not believe is appropriate, but once the decision
to transfer has been made_by the physician or the individual_the regulations and the law require that it be done appropriately.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also with regard to appropriate transfers, we note that the Secretary has taken the position that in proving that a
hospital or physician violated section 1867 of the Act, there is no requirement to prove that the transfer was effected
due to some ``impermissible motive.'' This position has been upheld in

We decline the invitation to attempt to define in advance all circumstances making the transfer of an unstabilized
individual ``appropriate.'' There will be many medical emergencies arising in a variety of settings. The proper
handling of those emergencies will depend upon the resources available and the exercise of medical judgment focused
on the best interest of the individual's health and safety. We find the broad guidelines offered by Congress in section
1867(c)(2)(C) of the Act sufficiently specific to guide the exercise of that discretion and our evaluation of cases
in which dumping is alleged. For the present we do not believe that any additional elaboration is required or desirable.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that the regulations prevent any transfers, including those of stable patients, unless
that patient requires services or facilities not available at the hospital when the patient first arrived. Another
commenter wanted ``stable'' patients to be subject to the same ``appropriate transfer'' criteria as patients in
unstable condition because the regulatory definition of ``stabilized'' does not require the emergency medical
condition to be alleviated; it only requires that no material deterioration be likely.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To accept these comments would go beyond the scope of the statute, which does not regulate the transfer of stabilized
individuals. The statute allows hospitals to transfer an individual, without meeting the requirements of an appropriate
transfer, after his or her emergency medical condition is stabilized. The statute does require, however, that the
transferring hospital provide whatever medical treatment it can, within its capacity, to minimize the risks to the
individual with an unstabilized medical condition, and, in the case of a woman in labor, to the unborn child.

One commenter wanted the regulations to define the situations in which obstetrical transfers are appropriate because
in the commenter's State, hospitals that do not offer obstetrical services must always transfer pregnant patients
in active labor, especially high risk patients.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is not necessary to revise the regulations to be this specific. Regardless of practices within the State, COBRA
and OBRA 89 permit a woman in labor or with an unstabilized emergency medical condition to be transferred only if she
(or someone acting on her behalf) requests the transfer or if a physician signs a certification that the benefits outweigh
the risks. If the hospital does not provide obstetrical services, the benefits may outweigh the risks of transfer
or the woman or her representative may request a transfer. However, we cannot say categorically and in all cases that
this will be true. (Note also Response to next Comment.) Regardless of State law or practice, a hospital must fulfill
the requirements of the statute and cannot simply cite State law or practice as the basis for a transfer under the statute.
We note that OBRA 89 removed the term ``active labor'' from section 1867 of the Act and included the full range of symptoms
that term was intended to include within the scope of the term ``emergency medical condition,'' which it redefined.

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If an individual is to be transferred, section 1867(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act requires that the hospital obtain agreement
from the receiving hospital before a transfer is made. The changes made to title XVIII of the Act by COBRA did not require
hospitals to accept all transfers, even when the transfer would be in the individual's best interest. However, under
the nondiscrimination provision of section 1867(g) of the Act, as added by section 6211(f) of OBRA 89, hospitals with
specialized capabilities or facilities (including, but not limited to, facilities such as burn units, shock-trauma
units, neonatal intensive care units, or (with respect to rural areas) regional referral centers as defined in &sect;412.96),
cannot refuse to accept an appropriate transfer of an individual who requires such specialized capabilities or facilities
if the hospital has the capacity to treat the individual. Accordingly, we have added the nondiscrimination provision
to &sect;489.24 as new paragraph (e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether new &sect;489.24(e) applies, we will assess whether the individual required the recipient
hospital's specialized capabilities or facilities and if the hospital had the capacity to treat the individual.
The recipient hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities has an obligation under section 1867(g) of the
Act to accept a transfer if the individual has an unstabilized emergency medical condition and if the hospital has
the capacity to treat the individual. If a hospital desires to transfer an individual to another hospital and the individual
does not require any treatment beyond the capabilities or facilities available at the transferring hospital, the
intended receiving hospital may refuse to accept the transfer of the individual in accordance with section 1867(c)(2)(B)(ii)
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this requirement is to prevent hospitals with emergency departments from automatically transferring
patients before screening simply because the hospital does not offer a particular service. For example, a hospital
with an obstetrical department is not required to accept a transfer of a woman in labor just because the transferring
hospital does not have an obstetrical department. If the woman in labor is having a normal, uncomplicated delivery,
and the first hospital has the capacity to handle a normal, uncomplicated delivery, despite the fact that it does not
have an obstetrical department, the first hospital is required under section 1867(b) of the Act to provide the necessary
stabilizing treatment, that is to deliver the baby and the placenta, or to effect an appropriate transfer to another
hospital willing to accept the patient. Similarly, for an individual with a simple, closed fractured arm, a hospital
with an orthopedic department and orthopedic physicians on call would not be required to accept a transfer of the individual
just because the transferring hospital does not have an orthopedic service. The first hospital is required under
section 1867(b) of the Act to provide the necessary stabilizing treatment or to effect an appropriate transfer to
another hospital willing to accept the patient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a transferring hospital does not have the specialized capabilities necessary to stabilize the patient's condition,
the intended receiving hospital with the specialized capabilities and facilities must accept the patient under
1867(g) of the Act if it has the capacity to treat the individual. The number of patients that may be occupying a specialized
unit, the number of staff on duty, or the amount of equipment on the hospital's premises do not in and of themselves reflect
the capacity of the hospital to care for additional patients. If a hospital generally has accommodated additional
patients by whatever means (for example, moving patients to other units, calling in additional staff, borrowing
equipment from other facilities) it has demonstrated the ability to provide services to patients in excess of its
occupancy limit. For example, a hospital may be able to care for one or more severe burn patients (a common example of
specialized service) without opening up a ``burn unit.'' In this example, if the hospital has the capacity, the hospital
would have a duty to accept an appropriate transfer of an individual requiring the hospital's capabilities, provided
the transferring hospital lacked the specialized services required to stabilize the individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Situations may arise where a hospital in another country desires to transfer an individual to a United States hospital
because of the United States hospital's specialized capabilities or facilities. However, we note that the provisions
of section 1867 of the Act are applicable only when the transferring hospital is located within the boundaries of the
United States. Accordingly, Medicare participating hospitals are not obligated to accept transfers from hospitals
located outside of the boundaries of the United States. This does not change the requirement that a Medicare participating
hospital that offers emergency services, must provide, upon request and within its capabilities, an appropriate
medical screening examination, stabilizing treatment, and/or an appropriate transfer to another medical facility
to any individual with an emergency medical condition, even if the individual is not a United States citizen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning community plans, the use of cooperative agreements to facilitate appropriate transfers would be a positive
step, and we recognize that a suggestion for using the JCAHO approach is constructive; however, we do not believe that
this regulation is an appropriate vehicle to mandate community-based plans for the delivery of emergency services.

 We do not believe it is necessary to add any further specificity to this requirement because, as indicated above, it
is understood that the records will have to verify that the receiving hospital has indicated to the transferring hospital
that it has agreed to treat the individual, which implies that it had the available space and qualified personnel to
treat that individual.

We do not believe it is appropriate to make this an explicit requirement of the regulations. The statute makes clear
that the transferring hospital is responsible for ensuring that when the individual is transferred, the transfer
is ``appropriate.'' The hospital, in ensuring that the individual is appropriately transferred, may, for example,
delegate to the transferring physician the duty to ensure that the transfer is made through the use of appropriate
personnel or equipment. Further, section 1867 of the Act and the regulations require that the hospital must provide
medical care within its capabilities to minimize the risks associated with transfer; this too may be delegated to
a physician. In this way, the physician may be responsible for the patient's care during the transfer.

Four commenters believe that the requirement that hospitals report suspected violations of section 1867 of the Act
within 72 hours of their occurrence is too rigid and should be changed to ``with reasonable promptness'' to deter excessive
reporting and to allow for investigation by the hospital to assure that reporting is warranted.

If transfers occur that needlessly jeopardize people's lives, HCFA must have that information immediately to meet
its responsibility to assure that these inappropriate transfers cease quickly. Therefore, we have made no changes.

One commenter recommended that the 72-hour reporting requirement for receiving hospitals suspecting improper
transfers should begin from the time a problem is first identified rather than from the date of the transfer.

The time of the receipt of an improperly transferred patient is the time of the occurrence. We do not see any substantive
time difference between the time of receipt and the time of identification that a patient had been improperly transferred.
However, to make reporting less onerous, we are revising &sect;489.20(m) and &sect;489.53(a)(10) to require a hospital
to report to either HCFA or the State agency, rather than both as proposed.

One commenter suggested that the regulation be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended to permit HCFA to terminate a receiving hospital only for a ``knowing'' failure to report suspected violations.

We see no reason to require that HCFA prove that a hospital ``knowingly'' violated its obligation to report instances
of suspected dumping before it may take action against a non-complying hospital. As with other conditions of participation
imposed on providers for the protection of the health and safety of those benefitted by title XVIII, including those
protected by section 1867 of the Act, whether a hospital fails to meet its obligations knowingly is of little concern
to those the requirement is designed to benefit. We believe this is especially true since section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA
90 deleted the provision under which HCFA had to show first that the hospital's actions were either knowing and willful
or negligent before terminating the hospital's provider agreement. We do not believe the enhanced enforcement and,
hence, deterrence, behind requiring receiving hospitals to report instances of suspected dumping, would be advanced
by adding any requirement that the violation be knowing before a hospital's failure to report could result in its termination.
We expect hospitals to have and enforce policies and procedures to require its employees and staff physicians to report
to the administration instances where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an individual has been inappropriately transferred under this statute.

We do not have the authority to confer immunity on a provider that identifies an alleged improper transfer under these
regulations. However, HCFA has a history of protecting the identity and confidentiality of entities who report program
violations and this protection will be extended to hospitals and individuals reporting improper transfers. Additionally,
we also note that section 4027(k)(3) of OBRA 90 amended section 1867(i) of the Act (Whistleblower Protections), which
was enacted under OBRA 89, to prevent a hospital from penalizing or taking adverse action against any hospital employee
because the employee reported a violation of this requirement. We have revised &sect;489.24(d)(3) of the regulations
to reflect this statutory amendment.

Eight commenters claimed that the statute does not support the obligation to report suspected dumping or provide
for the termination of a provider that does not report suspected violations. Five commenters suggested that we extend
the responsibility to report suspected dumping violations to all Medicare providers and suppliers; ambulance service
suppliers, in particular, are in a position to suspect violations if the hospital to which the ambulance is transporting
the patient refuses to accept that patient. Several commenters recommended that the reporting requirements be extended
to physicians and that a failure to comply with these requirements would subject the physician to a civil monetary
penalty.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe our requirements relating to reporting instances of dumping are supported by current law. Section 1861(e)(9)
of the Act permits the Secretary to impose on hospitals such other requirements as he finds necessary in the interest
of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services in the institution. It is under this authority that
the Secretary has obligated hospitals that participate in Medicare to report when they receive patients that have
been inappropriately transferred. Under section 1866(b)(2) (A) and (B) of the Act, the Secretary may terminate the
provider agreement of a hospital that is not complying substantially with the statute and regulations under title
XVIII or that no longer substantially meets the provisions of section 1861 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application of the anti-dumping provisions to all Medicare providers and suppliers should occur through a statutory
amendment. Section 1867 of the Act imposes duties directly only on hospitals that provide emergency services to which
individuals come for screening or treatment. No similar statutory authority generally exists to regulate the conduct
of non-providers, suppliers and practitioners.

We disagree. We are looking to those institutions in the best position to discern when an inappropriate transfer has
taken place in violation of the statute, because Congress regards them also as victims of ``dumping''. (See section
1867(d)(2)(B) of the Act.) This reporting requirement is not, however, an impediment to negotiation among hospitals
for the care of emergency patients. Indeed, it should encourage hospitals to cooperate in planning for appropriate
emergency care by eliminating inappropriate transfers.

We agree that ``suspected'' is a vague term. As a result we are revising proposed &sect;489.53(a)(10) to require a
hospital to report violations when a hospital has reason to believe that a violation has occurred. However, we see
no need to define which individuals in a hospital must hold the suspicion since we do not want to narrow the source of
reports.

are also written decisions and directives interpreting this issue and that using the OCR definition would relieve
Hill-Burton facilities of the risk of being required to comply with inconsistent treatment standards for women in
active labor.

We have not adopted the commenters' suggestion, because section 6211(h)(1)(B) of OBRA 89 deletes the definition
of ``active labor'' in section 1867(e)(2) of the Act. However, the concepts contained in that definition have now
been clarified and included in the definition of ``emergency medical condition'' defined in section 1867(e)(1)
of the Act.

One commenter asked us to make it clear that even though it may be difficult to state whether delivery is imminent, a
woman would be in ``active labor'' as that term is defined in section 1867(e)(2) of the Act (as added by COBRA), if there
was either inadequate time to effect safe transfer to another hospital before delivery or if a transfer might pose
a threat to the health and safety of the woman or the unborn child. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree. The proposed regulation restated the statutory definition, and, hence, reiterated that the transfer of
a woman in labor is subject to the provisions of section 1867 of the Act if any of the following three conditions pertain:
(a) delivery is imminent; (b) there is inadequate time to effect safe transfer to another hospital prior to delivery;
or (c) a transfer may pose a threat to the health and safety of the woman or the unborn child. Section 6211(h)(2) of OBRA
89 amended section 1867(e) of the Act by deleting both the term ``active labor'' and the part of the definition that
covers women in labor where delivery is imminent. The definition of ``emergency medical condition'', however, was
expanded to include a woman who is having contractions when there is inadequate time to effect safe transfer to another
hospital before delivery or a woman who is having contractions where the transfer may impose a threat to the health
or safety of the woman or the unborn child. The OBRA 89 amendments clarified the scope of the statutory protections.
We have amended &sect;489.24(b) accordingly. In addition, the statute also refers to women in labor. We have defined
the term ``labor'' in &sect;489.24(b).

We believe that the ACEP definition is not suitable for purposes of requirements under section 1867 of the Act because
it is designed to assure that cases in which the patient believes that an emergency medical condition exists are, in
fact, emergencies. We believe that section 1867 of the Act only applies to actual emergencies as determined by appropriate
medical screening. Therefore, we have not adopted this recommendation.

We do not agree to delete the phrase ``placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy.'' The definition parallels
the statute and as such reflects Congressional intent. All of the phrases contained in the definition of emergency
medical condition describe outcomes that are likely to result from the denial of immediate attention upon the exercise
of medical judgment to predict what would happen to the individual if appropriate medical attention was not provided
immediately.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nine commenters stated that the definitions of ``stabilized'' or ``stabilization'' are too vague or ambiguous to
be useful in determining whether a patient was appropriately transferred. Some commenters suggested alternative
definitions while others suggested we prohibit transfers not based solely on explicit medical reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory and regulatory definitions of ``to stabilize'' and ``stabilized'' are necessarily broad to apply
to all types of emergency medical conditions. The basic precept of these definitions is to ensure that no material
deterioration occurs to a patient's condition either as a result of the transfer or because the patient is outside
a hospital, and thus without the facilities and services available in a hospital. We do believe, however, that at least
one clarifying revision should be incorporated into the regulations to ensure that a patient with an emergency medical
condition will not be transferred unless, within reasonable medical probability, no material deterioration of
the condition is likely to result from, or occur during, the transfer. This revision is also consistent with section
6211(h)(1)(C)(ii) of OBRA 89. The regulations are being revised accordingly. The regulations do prohibit hospital-initiated
transfers that are not based solely on explicit medical reasons. This does not imply, however, in proving that a hospital
or physician violated section 1867 of the Act, that the Secretary must prove the transfer was effected due to an impermissible
or nonmedical motive. (See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We cannot specify the length of time that it will take to stabilize a specific condition, as a specific time period would
rarely be applicable in all cases. The statutory definition, as applied, prevents a hospital from transferring an
individual who is going through alcohol detoxification if that condition constitutes an emergency medical condition,
until that individual can make the transfer without a material deterioration of the condition occurring during,
or resulting from, the transfer. Therefore, we are not adopting this suggestion.

It is impossible to define in advance all of the circumstances in which an individual may come to a hospital emergency
department. What will constitute an appropriate medical screening examination will vary according to the condition
of the individual and the capabilities of the hospital's emergency department_both its facilities and available
personnel, including on-call physicians. Within those capabilities, the examination must be sufficient to detect
whether or not the individual has an emergency medical condition or is in labor because the law only requires hospitals
to provide screening and stabilizing treatment within their existing capabilities. Our current condition of participation
for emergency departments contains basic requirements, the specificity of which were subject to public comment
in connection with the revision of the hospital conditions of participation.

Congress did not specify a fixed monetary penalty for every violation. Instead, it provided for hospitals and responsible
physicians to be subject to a civil monetary penalty ``of not more than'' $25,000 for violations occurring before
December 22, 1987 and ``of not more than'' $50,000 for violations occurring on or after that date. The civil monetary
penalty section was amended in OBRA 90 to provide a maximum penalty of $25,000 for hospitals with fewer than 100 state-licensed,
Medicare-certified beds. By setting a maximum amount, Congress implied that the Secretary was to exercise her discretion
in selecting an appropriate amount up to that maximum.

The OIG will not consider the lack of a prior history of offenses to be a mitigating circumstance, but it may consider
a history of inappropriate transfers to be a factor that would warrant imposition of a penalty at or near the statutory
maximum. Only if a hospital or physician could offer positive evidence of a history of statutory compliance (for example,
by producing logs of its disposition of individuals who had come to the emergency department) would the OIG be inclined
to regard the violation as an isolated aberration.

We disagree. To deter future violations of the statute, Congress intended that violations be sanctioned regardless
of whether a violating hospital took remedial action. Such remedial action may prevent the hospital from suffering
the consequences of a termination of its provider agreement and the resulting loss of Medicare payment, but it does
not shield it from liability for civil monetary penalties if the violations were negligent. Congress enacted section
1867 of the Act because it perceived that hospitals were not policing themselves sufficiently to prevent inappropriate
transfers.

only allows a penalty of up to $25,000.

Section 4009(a)(1) of OBRA 87 amended section 1867(d) of the Act to increase the maximum civil monetary penalty from
$25,000 to $50,000, effective December 22, 1987. Any violation occurring after December 22, 1987 is therefore subject
to a maximum fine of up to $50,000 while violations occurring prior to December 22, 1987 are only subject to a maximum
fine of up to $25,000. We are amending 42 CFR 1003.103 accordingly. However, section 4008(b)(2) of OBRA 90 again amended
the statute by reducing the maximum penalty against hospitals with fewer than 100 state-licensed, Medicare-certified
beds of $25,000.

One commenter stated that civil monetary penalties of up to $50,000 constituted a criminal sanction that will place
physicians in the position of balancing responsible medical judgment against the fear of fines for an unanticipated
event that may occur during transfer; this will have negative effect on emergency care.

The maximum amount of the penalty is determined by the statute and cannot be changed in these regulations. The statute
expressly provides for a civil monetary penalty of not more than $50,000 if a hospital or physician who is responsible
for the examination, treatment or transfer of an individual in a participating hospital violates a provision of section
1867 of the Act. This penalty is civil in nature and does not constitute a criminal sanction.

Three commenters expressed concerns about the statutory provision that states that section 1867 of the Act does not
preempt State or local law except where they conflict. One of these commenters thought that Federal law should not
supersede State and local law except where the State is not fulfilling its obligation under the law; another commenter
believed we should grant immunity to hospitals following Federal statute in conflict with State law. The third commenter
said this provision would result in more State regulation where States have similar laws.

Section 1867(f) of the Act explicitly states that the provisions of section 1867 do not preempt any State or local law
requirement except in cases of a direct conflict. This statutory statement cannot be removed based on negative public
comment. We believe, however, that the second commenter misunderstood the provision: when Federal law conflicts
with State law, Federal law prevails.

One commenter expressed concern that a provider may be subject to double jeopardy if HCFA is allowed to terminate the
provider agreement for violating section 1867 of the Act and then, for the same violation, the OIG is authorized to
suspend the provider. Several commenters expressed concern that a provider is subject to double jeopardy since,
for an alleged single inappropriate transfer, OIG may suspend a provider and subject the provider to civil monetary
penalties even if HCFA determines there is no violation.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A provider agreement can no longer be suspended for a violation of section 1867 of the Act since, as we previously indicated,
section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90 deleted the suspension provisions contained in the original legislation. If, however,
HCFA begins a termination action based on a violation of the statute, but the hospital avoids termination by demonstrating
to HCFA's satisfaction that it has in place effective policies and procedures to prevent a recurrence, the OIG remains
free to seek civil monetary penalties against the hospital and physician for the violation of the statute on which
the termination action was originally based.

One commenter stated that, in order to avoid duplication of effort, the regulations should limit OIG investigation
to those cases where it finds a pattern of noncompliance, with willful violation of the provisions, or where there
is some indication of fraud or abuse against the Medicare program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The law does not require a pattern of violations or willful noncompliance for the Department to invoke sanctions.
The OIG may impose a civil monetary penalty for a single violation of the statute. The statute was amended in OBRA 90,
however, to allow the OIG to exclude physicians from participation in the Medicare and State health care programs
only if the violation is ``gross and flagrant or repeated.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``gross and flagrant'' is also used in section 1156 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320c&hyph;5, and has been defined
in regulations at 42 CFR 1004.1(b). This definition has been challenged for being unconstitutionally vague and the
courts have disagreed, upholding the Department's interpretation of the term. See, for example,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Violations of section 1867 of the Act have the potential to be immediate and serious threats to patient health and safety.
Therefore, we believe that it is essential that a violation that poses an immediate and serious threat be corrected
as rapidly as possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases where it has been determined that the violation poses an immediate and serious threat to patient health and
safety, a hospital will be placed on a 23-day termination track. On day 1, the hospital will receive a preliminary notice
of termination from the regional office stating that a violation has been identified and that the projected date of
termination will be on day 23. The preliminary notice of termination will also inform the hospital that the HCFA regional
office will issue a final notice of termination and inform the public of the date of termination at least 2 days, but
not more than 4 days, before the projected date of termination. Thus, the final notice to the hospital and the public
concerning the termination of the hospital's provider agreement for a violation that poses an immediate and serious
threat to patient health and safety will be issued between day 19 and day 21 of the 23-day termination track.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preliminary notice of termination will also inform the hospital that it may avoid the termination action by either
providing credible evidence of correction of the deficiencies or by successfully showing that the deficiencies
did not exist. The hospital will have an opportunity to make such a showing to the regional office between day 1 and day
19 of the termination process. If the hospital is successful, the regional office will stop the termination process,
and there will not be a public notice of termination. If verification of correction does not occur before the 19th day
of the termination track, the hospital receives a final notice of termination, and the public is concurrently notified
by publication of the effective date of the termination in the newspaper.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases that do not involve an immediate and serious threat to patient health and safety, a hospital will be placed
on a 90-day termination track. The hospital will receive a preliminary notice of termination on day 1, and will be notified
that the projected termination date will be on day 90. We will continue our current practice, set forth in &sect;489.53(c)(1),
of issuing a final notice of termination to the hospital and the public 15 days prior to the effective date of termination.
Thus, in situations where the violation does not constitute an immediate and serious threat to patient health and
safety, public notice of the effective date of the termination will be given on approximately day 75 of the 90-day termination
process unless the hospital successfully shows that correction has occurred.

With regard to possible civil monetary penalties or physician exclusion, OBRA 90 responds to the commenter's suggestion.
Under section 1154(a)(16) of the Act, as added by section 4027(a)(1)(B) of OBRA 90, PRO must provide reasonable notice
of the review to the physician and hospital involved and a reasonable opportunity for discussion and submission of
additional information prior to providing their report to HCFA. Thus, we believe that the commenter's concerns are
mitigated by this new statutory language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to termination, HCFA regional office staff may meet with the hospital's representatives before determining
compliance or noncompliance if they decide they need additional information to make a compliance determination.
If, after reviewing the State agency finding and medical review findings (if requested), the regional office staff
has sufficient information to make a determination, they may decide not to meet informally with the hospital's representatives.
Options for resolving the deficiencies do not affect the compliance determination.

One commenter stated that mandatory termination is not consistent with the statute. Seven commenters recommended
that the regulations not state that any violation will result in termination; termination should be imposed only
for particularly egregious violations or a pattern of repeated violations. Several commenters questioned the basis
for considering a violation to pose an immediate and serious threat, especially when there is only one violation.
Five of these commenters thought single violations should be sanctioned with civil monetary penalties.

Section 1866(b)(2) of the Act permits HCFA to terminate but does not require HCFA to do so. There are cases in which a
violation has occurred but in which HCFA has not chosen to terminate. For example, if a routine recertification survey
shows that a hospital's internal quality assurance identified a violation that occurred 6 months ago, and since then
the hospital has been functioning effectively under a corrective action plan, and the hospital is in compliance with
all other conditions of participation, HCFA may determine that although the hospital did violate the statute 6 months
earlier, a termination is not warranted at the time of the survey.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute does not limit termination action to hospitals that have a pattern of violations. A single violation may
result in the initiation of termination procedures. However, HCFA is more interested in hospitals correcting their
deficiencies and remaining available to serve patients than in terminating them from Medicare participation. As
a result, HCFA regional office staff have generally exercised their authority to permit correction before the effective
date of termination as justification for rescinding the termination. On the other hand, hospitals that do not correct
the deficiencies that permitted a violation to occur may represent an immediate and serious threat to people seeking
emergency care. In such a case, HCFA will move quickly to either assure that the deficiencies that led to the violation
are corrected or to terminate the hospital's provider agreement. It should be noted that section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA
90 deleted the termination and suspension language from section 1867(d) of the Act. Terminations due to violations
of section 1867 of the Act are now subject to the regular provider agreement rules in section 1866 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the immediate and serious threat concept applies to a provider's potential for causing harm as a result
of lax policies and procedures as well as the danger posed by patently unsafe physical conditions or staffing shortages.
Thus, we believe that operating in a manner that potentially subjects individuals to the threat of summary transfer
without treatment may pose an immediate and serious threat to individuals who present themselves to the hospital
for treatment. As noted above, if the provider is able to demonstrate that this is not the case, the termination is withdrawn
and the provider's participation in the program is uninterrupted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hence, while a single violation may very well be sanctioned with civil monetary penalties, nothing in the statutory
scheme suggests that the authority to terminate a hospital's provider agreement should be limited by the number of
violations.

The factors to be considered in determining the amount of civil monetary penalty that are set forth in &sect;1003.106(a)(4)
are adapted from those mandated by section 1128A(d) of the Act. Section 1867(d)(1) of the Act requires that the provisions
of section 1128A of the Act other than subsection (a) and subsection (b) apply to the imposition of a civil monetary
penalty against a participating hospital and physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As thus incorporated by reference, section 1128A(d) of the Act requires that the OIG consider the nature of claims
and circumstances under which they were presented, the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses, and financial
condition of the person presenting the claims, and such other matters as justice may require. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are revising proposed &sect;1003.106(a)(4) to reflect the essence of these statutory considerations as modified
to fit violations of section 1867 of the Act. Section 1003.106(a)(4) also now includes among the factors ``financial
condition'' and ``nature and circumstances of the violation.'' These were omitted from the notice of proposed rulemaking
but are required under section 1128A(d) of the Act.

One commenter stated that, before termination, HCFA should consider all circumstances of the case including such

on the community.

Congress has provided that any hospital that has failed to comply with the requirements of section 1867 of the Act is
subject to termination of its provider agreement. It did not provide, or suggest in legislative history, that the
Secretary should create a system of lesser measures to account for the factors mentioned by the commenter. Rather,
it intended the gravity of the sanction to cause hospitals to comply with their obligations. When a hospital does violate
its duties under section 1867 of the Act, we must take immediate action to prevent that hospital from jeopardizing
the health and safety of the next person who may seek help in an emergency situation. Vigorous enforcement of these
provisions is essential to remedy the problem that prompted Congress to legislate against the denial of screening
and/or treatment and the inappropriate transfer of individuals with emergency medical conditions. A hospital will
not suffer the loss of Medicare funding if it can demonstrate to HCFA's satisfaction that it has taken the steps necessary
to ensure that the mandates of the statute are observed by its employees, contractors, and staff. If a hospital demonstrates
its unwillingness or inability to meet that commitment within the time provided, it will be terminated. When a hospital
has had a history of violations, the situation may make the regional office skeptical about the hospital's willingness
and ability to enforce its own policies to guarantee that emergency services are available to all. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We recognize that the termination of a hospital's provider agreement would have a serious impact on the community.
This is the remedy the law provides. We believe that this remedy provides the hospital (and its community) with the
incentive to assure compliance.

 In view of the nature of the problems that this provision addresses, it is not appropriate to take a general approach
that permits a provided to avoid immediate inspection in all cases. The HCFA regional office will determine whether
there is an advantage to conducting an unscheduled survey. We note, however, that when continued monitoring is appropriate
to assure that corrective action has been taken, we will inform the provider of the period for which monitoring will
continue.

 As we previously indicated, section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90 deleted section 1867(d)(1) of the Act, which provided for
termination or suspension of a hospital's Medicare provider agreement for ``knowingly and willfully, or negligently''
failing to meet these statutory requirements. However, section 1866(a)(1)(I)(i) of the Act was also amended to require
hospitals to meet the provisions of section 1867 in order to participate in the Medicare program. We have, therefore,
revised &sect;489.24(f) of this regulation to delete the requirement that a hospital must knowingly and willfully,
or negligently, fail to meet the regulation's requirements to be subject to termination. It should also be noted that
because of the deletion of section 1867(d)(1) of the Act, hospitals are no longer subject to suspension of their provider
agreement based upon violation of these provisions. By requiring that all hospitals comply with the provisions of
section 1867 of the Act, Congress indicated that section 1867 violations by hospitals could result in termination
of a hospital's Medicare provider agreement and civil monetary penalties. In addition, as discussed below, civil
monetary penalties may now be imposed for a negligent, rather than a knowing, violation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language of the statute does not permit us to adopt the commenter's suggestion. ``Knowingly'' is a legal term with
a well-developed history. The accepted meaning of the term does not include ``should have known.'' Indeed, the latter
term denotes a lack of knowledge and is used in those contexts where a person is held liable for not knowing what he or
she would have known had he or she exercised due care. A person need not know the terms of the statute in order to commit
a knowing violation of the statute. A knowing violation of the statute requires only that the person do a proscribed
act, knowing the character of the proscribed act. In this context, for example, a physician would knowingly violate
the statute if he or she certified that the transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition that had not
been stabilized was in the best interests of the patient if the physician knew that the patient had an emergency condition
that had not been stabilized and that the risks of transfer outweighed the benefits the physician could reasonably
expect by the delivery of appropriate care in the receiving hospital. The physician would not need to know that section
1867 of the Act prohibited such transfer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the term ``knowingly'' does not encompass ``should have known,'' it does embrace the concepts of ``reckless
disregard'' and ``deliberate ignorance.'' That is, it includes a form of constructive knowledge in which an individual
is deemed to have actual knowledge of the facts and circumstances about which he or she would have had knowledge if the
individual had not deliberately or recklessly disregarded facts that were readily available. We are amending &sect;1003.102(c)
to make it clear that the term ``knowingly'' encompasses these two concepts.

Hospitals in violation of the statute are subject to termination and civil monetary penalties. Thus, any substantiated
violation may result in termination. Once these regulations are published, specific guidelines for assessing whether
a case represents a violation will be included in the State Operations and Regional Office Medicare Certification
Manuals. While the manuals in no way purport to be exhaustive in their description of potential section 1867 violations,
they do provide a sense as to how HCFA intends to interpret this provision. The manuals are sent to HCFA's regional offices
and each State agency. They are also available on a subscription basis from the Department of Commerce's National
Technical Information Service, 5825 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia, 22161. These manuals are continually
updated to reflect new regulations.

This is an issue that has been litigated extensively in the past. The courts have widely held that due process for providers
of health services under the Medicare program does not require a formal hearing before adverse action is taken. Our
regulations at &sect;498.5(b) have long provided for a post-termination hearing before an administrative law judge
for providers that have been terminated. Also, in accordance with &sect;498.5(c), any provider dissatisfied with
a hearing decision may request Appeals Council review and has a right to seek judicial review of the Council's decision.

The statute at section 1866(c)(1) of the Act provides that a hospital that has been terminated from the Medicare program
may not file another agreement unless the Secretary finds that the reason for the termination has been removed and
that there is reasonable assurance that it will not recur. Thus, terminated hospitals may reapply for Medicare certification
whenever they have corrected the deficiencies that caused the termination. We reserve the right to determine an appropriate
reasonable assurance period before reinstatement on a case-by-case basis.

Section 1867(d)(3) of the Act, as added by section 4027(a)(1) of OBRA 90, sets forth the role of PROs in patient dumping
cases. Specifically, for sanctions imposed on or after February 1, 1991, section 1867(d)(3) of the Act requires the
appropriate PRO to review the case prior to the imposition of a civil monetary penalty or physician exclusion sanction,
except when a delay would jeopardize the health and safety of individuals or when an individual is denied a screening
examination. Given this statutory direction, we do not believe it would be appropriate to place additional requirements

One commenter recommended that HCFA require hospitals to maintain a record of the disposition of all individiuals
seeking emergency care. If the individual were transferred, such a log would bear the initials of the physician authorizing
the transfer and identify the reasons for the transfer, the receiving hospital, and the person accepting transfer
for that hospital. Such records would educate hospital personnel about the statutory requirements, deter violations,
and provide an audit trail to assist HHS in performing its monitoring and enforcement duties.

Another commenter suggested that we require each hospital to maintain a record of all patients it transfers and of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree that the hospital must maintain a central log or record of how it handles every individual that comes to its
emergency department for HHS and its agents to monitor compliance with the statute. The OIG has reported that a lack
of a central record on the disposition of persons seeking emergency services hampers HHS' ability to monitor compliance
(Office of Inspector General, ``Patient Dumping After COBRA: Assessing the Incidences and the Perspectives of Health
Care Professionals'' (August 1988)). Hence, we are amending the regulations at &sect;489.20(r)(3) to require a
hospital to maintain a central log of all individuals who come to its emergency room seeking assistance and the disposition
of such individuals, whether they were or are refused treatment, transferred, admitted and treated, stabilized
and transferred, or discharged. Such a record will permit HHS and the State survey and certification agencies to select
and gain access to individual medical records for further inquiry. However, we are not prescribing a standard form
at this time. Our condition of participation for medical record services, at &sect;482.24(b), requires hospitals
to maintain a medical record for each inpatient and outpatient. Additionally, our enforcement procedures include
a review of a simple of patient records. The sampling technique takes into account emergency room triage and unreimbursed
care.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 80 percent of the 6600 hospitals participating in the Medicare program are accredited by the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). JCAHO-accredited hospitals are required to
maintain a control register and initiate a medical record every time an individual visits the emergency service (Standard
ES.6). The JCAHO-mandated control register must contain at least the names of all persons (including the names of
individuals dead on arrival) seeking care, as well as their age and sex; date, time, and means of arrival; nature of
the complaint; disposition; and time of departure. The regulation at &sect;489.20(r)(3) merely requires the name
of the individual and the disposition of his or her case. We believe maintaining a register of individuals seeking
care is an industry standard and will not impose an additional burden on the 20 percent of hospitals that are not accredited.
We have found a control register or control log to be invaluable in identifying records to be reviewed during our complaint
investigations. We have not found any hospital that is not maintaining a log of some sort.

utilized by the PROs under section 1154(a)(6)(A) of the Act.

resorting to sanctions.

This regulation emphasizes correction over sanctions. Hospitals that have violated these requirements are permitted
the opportunity to correct the deficiencies and avoid termination. To date, 96 percent of violating hospitals have
been able to avoid termination by correcting the deficiencies that led to the violations. However, the Department's
primary responsibility is toward people who need health care, and in cases in which a hospital either cannot or does
not correct its deficiencies, we believe it is appropriate to terminate the hospital from the Medicare program quickly.
In addition, the law includes authority to exclude physicians and impose civil monetary penalties against hospitals
and physicians. This serves as both a remedial function and a deterrent function. This may also motivate corrections
and improvements to prevent future violations of the statute.

Three commenters indicated that hospitals should be involved in the investigation's fact finding process and should
be advised of all evidence before HCFA receives the deficiency report. In addition, they recommended the hospital
be permitted to submit documentation regarding the evidence and a response to the information submitted to HCFA,
so that HCFA will have all the information before taking action.

When the onsite investigation of a violation of section 1867 of the Act is completed, the hospital's representatives
have an opportunity to be informed of the scope of the survey agency's investigation and findings at an exit conference.
The survey agency, however, will inform the hospital that, unlike other surveys, an investigation of a violation
of section 1867 of the Act usually does not end with its onsite investigation; it may require medical review. The HCFA
regional office will make the final determination based on all of the relevant information, including the results
of medical review, if needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the regional office makes a determination of noncompliance, it will notify the hospital via a preliminary determination
letter. The date the hospital receives the preliminary determination letter becomes the date for commencement of
the termination process, which lasts approximately 23 days in situations where it has been determined that the violation
resulted in an immediate and serious threat to patient health and safety, or approximately 90 days where the violation
was not considered to pose an immediate and serious threat. If the regional office receives additional information
that proves the hospital did not violate section 1867 of the Act, or regional office verification reveals that the
hospital has taken remedial action to prevent further violations before the actual date of termination, the termination
action will be rescinded. As noted in a previous response to a comment, if there was a violation of section 1867 of the
Act and the hospital does not take corrective action, a final termination letter will be sent to the hospital and the
public will be notified concurrently through a notice in the newspaper (at least 2 days, but no more than 4 days, before
the actual termination date in immediate and serious threat situations, or at least 15 days before the actual termination
date in situations that do not pose an immediate and serious threat). Therefore, the change in the notice requirement
in immediate and serious threat situations offers the provider approximately 19 days to correct the deficiencies
before termination becomes effective in immediate and serious threat cases and continues to offer the provider approximately
75 days to correct deficiencies before termination becomes effective for situations that do not pose an immediate
and serious threat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the onset, the hospital is aware of the problem, HCFA's intended course of action, and that it must take corrective
action or prove that the violation did not exist in order to halt the termination process. During and after this period,
the hospital may submit documentation regarding the violation if it chooses; however, the termination process continues
until proof is submitted to establish that a violation had not occurred, corrective action is verified, or the termination
date is reached. HCFA's primary responsibility is to the people who come to the hospital in emergency situations.
Their urgent need for proper medical care is a higher priority than providing for time-consuming historical re-review
before action is taken against a hospital with improper practices.

 One commenter disagreed with HCFA's intention to rely on State survey agencies to investigate initial complaints
of violation because in many States these agencies have an inherent conflict of interest. The commenter recommended
that, to guarantee that there are no conflicts of interest, HCFA should at least apply certain minimum performance
standards and investigatory guidelines in determining in which States the State survey agency can be entrusted with
the role of investigating complaints.

As provided for by section 1864(c) of the Act, HCFA contracts with the State survey agency to conduct surveys to evaluate
compliance with Federal health and safety requirements. We provide training, survey report forms and interpretive
guidelines and perform Federal surveys and oversight to monitor the States' performances. Consequently, we are
confident of the States' abilities to conduct compliant investigations.

allowed to penalize or take action against any hospital employee because the employee reported a violation of these

The statute imposes duties on a hospital, many of which can only be effectively carried out by physicians in some way
affiliated with the hospital. Neither the statute nor the regulations attempt to define the means by which the hospital
meets its statutory obligations to provide emergency screening examination, treatment or transfer.

Three commenters raised a question concerning the hospital's responsibility in a case in which a physician who is
not responsible for providing emergency care, but whose specialty is required to perform stabilizing care, refuses
to treat or examine a patient.

Although the term ``responsible physician'' is no longer used in the statute, the Department has maintained the term
in these regulations, defining it to be consistent with the present statute. Hence, the definition of a ``responsible
physician'' as drafted in these regulations includes any physician to whom the hospital has delegated responsibility
to examine, treat, or transfer an individual that comes to the hospital emergency department seeking help. A hospital
may use physicians on its medical staff to carry out its responsibilities under the statute. As indicated in the OBRA
89 amendments to section 1867, these physicians, including those who provide emergency services on-call as a condition
of enjoying staff privileges, may be held liable for violating the statute and regulations.

One commenter recommended that ``responsible physician'' be defined to prevent a physician from being held liable
for not providing treatment that is beyond his clinical area of competence or hospital privileges or for treatment
decisions that are made in the physician's absence when the physician is available only by telephone.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not believe that the comment requires a change in the definition. The commenter is concerned that a physician
not be held responsible for aspects of an individual's care that are beyond his competence or hospital privileges.
Consistent with the statute, the regulations use the term ``responsible physician'' to denote a physician with the
responsibility to examine, treat, or transfer a patient. A hospital cannot require a physician to perform duties
that are either beyond the physician's competence or the scope of the physician's hospital privileges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, where a responsible physician makes treatment or transfer decisions by telephone, the physician
remains liable for such decisions.

We have amended the definition of ``responsible physician'' to comport with the OBRA 89 amendments to section 1867
of the Act. The definition encompasses any physician, including those physicians on-call, to whom the hospital has
delegated responsibility to examine, treat, or transfer an individual that comes to the hospital emergency department
seeking help. A hospital may use physicians on its medical staff to carry out its responsibilities under the statute.
OBRA 89 amended section 1866(a)(1)(I) of the Act to require the hospital, as a condition of participation, to ``maintain
a list of physicians who are on-call for duty after the initial examination to provide treatment necessary to stabilize
an individual with an emergency medical condition.''

As previously indicated, pursuant to OBRA 89, the hospital has a duty to ensure that, within the capabilities of the
hospital's staff and facility, the medical needs of an individual who comes to an emergency room can be met. The hospital's
capabilities include the skills of a specialist who has staff privileges to the extent that the hospital can require
the specialist to furnish these services. However, it is up to the hospital to determine how it will comply with its
statutory obligations.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be a responsible physician under the terms of the statute and regulations, a physician must be responsible for examining,
treating, or transferring an individual whom the statute protects. If an emergency room physician, for example,
is under contract with the hospital to provide emergency care and treatment, but does not have admitting privileges,
that physician is still under an obligation to provide an appropriate medical screening examination and either stabilizing
treatment within the capabilities of the staff and facilities of the hospital or an appropriate transfer under the
statute. Section 1867(d)(1)(C) of the Act specifically states that if a physician determines that an ``individual
requires the services of a physician listed by the hospital on its list of on-call physicians .&blank;.&blank;. and
notifies the on-call physician and the on-call physician fails or refuses to appear within a reasonable period of
time, and the physician orders the transfer of the individual because,'' without the on-call physician's services,
the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks of transfer, the transferring physician will not be subject to penalties
under section 1867 of the Act. However, this does not absolve the hospital and the on-call physician from liability
under the statute.

We do not agree with the commenter's contention. In reviewing allegations of patient dumping, we will look at all the
information available to the treating or transferring physician at the time the decision is made. We believe that
the physician's concern should be for the patient rather than for possible consequences of this requirement. To further
strengthen the protection of emergency room physicians with regard to their transfer decisions, section 6211(f)
of OBRA 89 added paragraph (i) to section 1867 of the Act to prevent hospitals from penalizing physicians who refuse
to authorize the transfer of an individual with an unstabilized emergency medical condition. In addition, section
4027(k)(3) of OBRA 90 amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1867(i) of the Act to provide similar protection to qualified medical emergency room staff with regard to
their transfer decisions when a physician is not available in the emergency room. We are amending &sect;489.24(d)(3)
to include these new provisions so that it conforms to the statute as amended.

A patient's obligations to pay for services provided by a hospital is beyond the scope of these regulations. However,

the statute and regulations with respect to that individual. Section 1867(h) of the Act, as added by section 6211(f)
of OBRA 89, states expressly that the ``hospital may not delay provision of an appropriate medical screening examination

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated above in section II.D. of this preamble, Responsibilities of Medicare Participating Hospitals in Emergency
Cases, and in several responses to comments, before imposing civil monetary penalties and exclusions, section 1867(d)(3)
of the Act requires that we request the appropriate PRO to assess whether the individual involved had an emergency
medical condition that had not been stabilized and report on its findings before the OIG may impose a civil monetary
penalty or exclusion. [Note: PRO review is not required in cases where a delay in effecting a sanction would jeopardize
the health or safety of individuals or in situations where medical review is inappropriate, for example, in cases
where an individual was denied a medical screening examination.] The Secretary must provide the PRO with at least
60 days for the review. The PRO is required to provide reasonable notice of the review to the hospital and physician
involved. The PRO is also required to provide them with a reasonable opportunity for discussion and an opportunity
to submit additional information. This provision is effective for sanctions imposed on or after February 1, 1991.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the possible termination phase of a case's development, the HCFA regional office has the responsibility and
authority to make a determination of compliance or noncompliance. Termination procedures provide for an opportunity
for the provider to comment. During this phase, the HCFA regional office is not required to instruct the PRO to offer
the affected hospital an opportunity for discussion and submission of additional information. Subsequent to this
phase, the OIG has the responsibility and authority to direct that the PRO conduct an assessment. In conducting such
as assessment, the PRO is required to offer the affected physician and/or hospital an opportunity for discussion
and submission of additional information before the PRO issues its report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are adding a new paragraph (g) to proposed &sect;489.24 to implement the statutory provision that PROs have at least
60 days to make their assessments and to specify that PROs must provide affected physicians and hospitals reasonable

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of review and opportunity for discussion and submission of additional information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we are adding a new &sect;489.24(h) to clarify that, upon request, HCFA may release a PRO assessment to
the physician or hospital (or both where applicable), or the affected individual, or his or her representative. However,
we specify that the PRO physician's identity is confidential unless he or she consents to release his or her identity,
in accordance with the PRO disclosure regulations set forth at &sect;&sect;476.132 and 476.133. If the case goes
to litigation, the PRO is required to provide expert testimony and it is preferable, but not required, that the testifying
physician be the same physician who reviewed and reported on the case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated earlier, the statutory change requiring PRO review applies only in situations involving civil monetary
penalties and exclusions. Termination proceedings pursuant to section 1866 of the Act as a result of violations of
the anti-dumping provisions of section 1866 and section 1867 do not require PRO review. We note that a facility could
be the subject of a termination proceeding and also be assessed civil monetary penalties.

rule, as amended by the revisions discussed below and clarifications discussed elsewhere in this preamble. (To accommodate
changes to the Code of Federal Regulations since the publication of the June 16, 1988 proposed rule, proposed paragraphs
(k) through (q) of &sect;489.20 have been redesignated as paragraphs (l) through (r).) Unless otherwise noted, revisions
are based on our evaluation of public comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA and VA: We made no revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Hospital discharge rights notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have revised this section to eliminate the requirement that the beneficiary or his or her representative acknowledge
receipt of the ``Message'' by signing the acknowledgement statement on the ``Message.'' We have also eliminated
the requirement that an acknowledgement of the ``Message'' be retained by the hospital. Instead, we will rely on hospitals
to determine how they can best comply with the requirement that each beneficiary be provided with a discharge rights
notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Hospital responsibility for emergency care.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are revising the proposed regulations as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.20(m): We have clarified &sect;489.20(m) to eliminate any implication that a hospital may improperly
transfer a patient as long as it is done with prior arrangement. In addition, we are requiring that when a hospital has
reason to believe that an individual was transferred in violation of the requirements of &sect;489.24, it will report
the violation to either HCFA or the State survey agency, rather than to both, as required by the proposed regulation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Section 489.20(q): We are adding provisions based on section 6018(a)(2) of OBRA 89, requiring hospitals to
post conspicuously in their emergency departments signs specifying rights of individuals under section 1867 of
the Act with respect to examination and treatment and to post 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conspicuously information indicating whether or not the hospital participates in the Medicaid program under a State
plan approved under title XIX. Some public commenters also wrote in support of the posting of signs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.20(r)(1): Pursuant to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6018(a)(1) of OBRA 89 and in response to public comment, we are adding the requirement that both transferring and receiving
hospitals maintain medical and other records related to individuals transferred for a period of 5 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.20(r)(2): Also pursuant to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6018(a)(1) of OBRA 89 and public comment, we are adding the requirement that a hospital maintain a list of physicians
who are on call for duty after the initial examination to provide treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.20(r)(3): We are requiring each hospital (both transferring and receiving) to keep a log of each
individual who came to the emergency department seeking assistance and whether he or she refused treatment or was
refused treatment, transferred, admitted and treated, stabilized and transferred, or discharged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(b): We are expanding the definition of ``emergency medical condition'' to include psychiatric
disturbances, symptoms of substance abuse, and situations with respect to pregnant women having contractions.
We add definitions of ``capacity'', ``comes to the emergency department'', ``hospital'', ``hospital with an emergency
department'', ``labor'', and ``participating hospital.'' We clarify other definitions to make them consistent
with other versions of the text. We have deleted the term ``active labor'' in accordance with section 6211(h)(1)(B)
of OBRA 89. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(c) (2) and (4) and (d) (1) and (2): We are adding provisions to require a written informed refusal
from the patient or individual acting on his or her behalf when the patient refuses treatment or transfer. We specify
that the medical record must contain a description of the examination and treatment, or transfer, or refusal. The
refusal must indicate that the patient (or person acting on his or her behalf) is aware of the risks and benefits of the
transfer, or the examination or treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(c)(3): We are adding the requirement that a hospital may not delay providing an appropriate
medical screening examination in order to inquire about payment method or insurance status. This is the result of
public comment and section 6211(h) of OBRA 89. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(d)(1)(ii)(A): Based on section 6211(c)(1) of OBRA 89 and public comment, we are adding a requirement
that an individual (or legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf) who wants to be transferred
must indicate in writing the reason for the request for transfer and that he or she is aware of its risks and benefits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(d)(3): Based on section 6211(i) of OBRA 89 and section 4027(k)(3) of OBRA 90, we are prohibiting
a hospital from penalizing or taking adverse action against a physician or a qualified medical person who refuses
to authorize the transfer of an individual with an emergency condition that has not been stabilized or against any
hospital employee because the employee reports a violation of this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(e): Based on section 6211(f) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA 89 and public comment, we are requiring that a hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities accept transfer
of any individual requiring those specialized capabilities or facilities if it has the capacity to treat the individual.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(f): Because of section 4008(b)(3)(A) of OBRA 90, the standard for terminating a hospital has
changed. HCFA is no longer required to prove that the hospital knowingly and willfully, or negligently, failed to
meet the requirements of this regulation. We may now terminate such hospitals for failing to meet these requirements
under section 1866 of the Act based upon section 4008(b)(3)(B) of OBRA 90, which requires hospitals to meet the requirements
of section 1867 of the Act in order to participate in the Medicare program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(g): Based on section 4027(a)(1) of OBRA 90, we are requiring PRO review to assess whether the
individual involved had an emergency medical condition that had not been stabilized, in addition to other medical
issues, before imposing a civil monetary penalty or exclusion, unless obtaining such review would cause delay that
would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals or if there is no medical issue to review (that is, no screening
examination was conducted). In cases that do not present jeopardy, the PRO review and report to HCFA must be completed
in 60 calendar days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.24(h): We are clarifying in new &sect;489.24(h) that, upon request, HCFA may release a PRO assessment
to the physician or hospital, or the affected individual or his or her representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.53(a): We are revising the proposed rule to require a receiving hospital to report incidents it
has reason to believe may be violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.53(b): We are adding to the reasons for termination_(a) a refusal of a hospital with specialized
capabilities or facilities that has the capacity to accept an appropriate transfer; (b) failure to maintain an on-call
duty roster, medical records for 5 years, and a log of individuals seeking emergency assistance; and (c) failure to
post notices as required concerning participation in Medicaid and the rights of individuals under 42 CFR part 489,
subpart B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 489.53(c)(2)(ii): We are specifying that a hospital found in violation of &sect;&sect;489.24(a)
through (h) will receive a final notice of termination and the public will be concurrently notified at least 2 but no
more than 4 days before the effective date of the termination. This allows a hospital approximately 19 to 21 days to
correct or refute alleged deficiencies. We also clarify that we will not terminate if the hospital has corrected or
refuted the deficiencies that gave rise to the termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We are adding ``or rural primary care hospital'' wherever ``hospital'' appears in &sect;489.24, as required
by section 6003(g) of OBRA 89. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We are also removing all references to suspension of the provider from the regulations at &sect;&sect;489.24
and 489.53, based on the deletion of the suspension authority by section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We are making none of the proposed revisions to part 1001, which all concerned suspension of providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1003.100: We are revising the proposed section to conform with several rulemaking documents that
have been published since our proposed rule. The requirements contained in proposed &sect;1003.100(b)(1)(ii)
are now set forth in &sect;1003.100(b)(1)(vi).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Section 1003.101: We are adding or revising in this section the definitions for the terms ``participating
hospital'' (to comport with the statute), ``respondent'', and ``responsible physician''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1003.102: This section also has been revised by several rulemaking documents since the publication
of our June 16, 1988, proposed rule. In this interim final rule, we are clarifying in paragraph (c)(2) that the term
``knowingly'' encompasses reckless disregard and deliberate ignorance of a material fact. We are also revising
this section to comport with the OBRA 89 amendments that allow the Inspector General to impose civil monetary penalties
when a physician signs a certification when he or she knew or should have known that the benefits did not outweigh the
risks of transfer, or when the physician misrepresents an individual's condition or other information. We are also
revising proposed &sect;1003.102(d) to eliminate the reference to a ``knowing'' standard (that is, a physician
knowingly failed to provide care). This results in a clearer approach that sets forth our basis for imposing civil
monetary penalties for violations of section 1867 of the Act and is consistent with the statutory amendments and with
other revisions to the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1003.103: We are revising this section in accordance with section 1867(d) of the Act, as amended by
section 4008 of OBRA 90, to clarify that the OIG may impose a penalty of not more than $50,000 against a participating
hospital and a penalty of not more than $50,000 against each responsible physician (and not more than $25,000 against
a participating hospital and each responsible physician for violations on or after August 1, 1986, but before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 22, 1987) for violations determined under &sect;1003.102(d). For penalties imposed on or after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 1, 1991, if the hospital has fewer than 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State-licensed, Medicare-certified beds, the maximum penalty will be $25,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1003.105: We are revising this section to comport with the OBRA 90 amendments to section 1867 of the
Act by specifying in &sect;1003.105(a)(1) that a physician who grossly and flagrantly or repeatedly violates the
statute or &sect;489.24 may be excluded from Medicare and any State health care program. We are also revising &sect;1003.105(b)
to clarify that, for determinations under &sect;&sect;1003.102 (b)(2) and (b)(3), and for violations under &sect;1003.102(c)(1)(ii)
occurring on or after December 22, 1987 and before July 1, 1990, a physician may not be excluded if the OIG determines
he or she is a sole community physician or the sole source of specialized services in that community. We are moving references
to limitations in time periods of exclusion to &sect;1003.107. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1003.105: Effective December 22, 1987, the statute was amended to allow the Secretary, pursuant to
section 1842(j)(2) of the Act, to exclude a physician who knowingly violated section 1867 of the Act. In OBRA 89 Congress
amended section 1867, allowing the Secretary, pursuant to section 1128A (instead of section 1842(j)(2)), to exclude
a physician who knowingly and willfully or negligently violated the statute. The statute was then amended in OBRA
90, changing the standard for exclusion from ``knowing and willful or negligent'' to ``gross and flagrant or repeated'',
effective May 1, 1991. We are implementing this provision in &sect;1003.105(a)(1)(ii)(C). In addition, in accordance
with section 1842(j)(3) of the Act, the physician may not be excluded if the physician is the sole community physician
or sole source of essential specialized services in a community. We are revising &sect;1003.105(b) to include these
exceptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1003.106: As indicated in a response to one of the comments, in accordance with the requirements of
section 1128A(d) of the Act, the final regulation includes two additional factors for consideration in determining
the amount of the penalty and the length of the exclusion under part 1003: (1) ``The financial condition of the hospital
and each responsible physician who have violated any requirement of section 1867 of the Act,'' and (2) ``The nature
and circumstances of the violation.'' We are adding &sect;1003.106(a)(4) to reflect these provisions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Section 1003.107: The regulations now reflect the requirement of section 1842(j)(3) of the Act that if an exclusion
is based upon section 1842(j)(2) of the Act, then the access of beneficiaries to physician's services must be considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 1003.108: We are revising this section to include the terms ``assessment'' and ``exclusion.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Technical revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have revised the regulation to reflect the statutory amendments relating to the term ``active labor.'' Section
6211(h)(1)(B) of OBRA 89 removed the term from the statutory definitions section (section 1867(e) of the Act) and
the concept it applied to was incorporated into the definition of emergency medical condition. Hence, in many areas
of the regulations, only the term ``emergency medical condition'' is included. However, the statute still uses the
term ``labor'' in certain circumstances, and the regulations reflect this where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under sections 6211(g) (1) and (2) of OBRA 89, the words ``patient,'' ``patients'' and ``patient's'' are replaced
by the words ``individual,'' ``individuals'' and ``individual's'', respectively, each place they appear in &sect;&sect;489.24
and 489.53 in reference to hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we have redesignated proposed &sect;405.1903 in this interim final rule as &sect;488.18(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unless the Secretary certifies that an interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612). For purposes of the RFA, we consider all hospitals to be small entities.
Individuals and states are not included in the definition of a small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any final
rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an
analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define
a small rural hospital as a hospital that has fewer than 100 beds and is located outside a Metropolitan Statistical
Area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of this rule merely conform the regulations to the legislative provisions of sections 9121 and 9122
of COBRA (as amended by section 4009 of OBRA 87), section 233 of the Veteran's Benefit Improvement and Health Care Authorization
Act of 1986, sections 9305 (b)(1) and 9307 of OBRA 86, section 4009 of OBRA 87, sections 6003(g)(3)(d)(XIV), 6018 and
6211 of OBRA 89 and sections 4008(b), 4027(a) and 4027(k)(3) of OBRA 90.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of this rule will require Medicare participating hospitals to provide inpatient services to individuals
with insurance coverage under CHAMPUS, CHAMPVA, and VA programs, provide each Medicare beneficiary a statement
of his or her rights concerning discharge from the hospital and provide an appropriate medical screening examination
to anyone who requests examination or treatment, and stabilizing treatment in the emergency room to any individual
with an emergency medical condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by the statute these provisions are in effect and are being enforced. Although hospitals may incur incremental
costs to ensure compliance with these provisions, we believe the costs are minimal and the benefits to individuals
far outweigh those costs. These provisions will allow military personnel and their families to receive inpatient
services in hospitals that may be closer to their homes as opposed to receiving services in military hospitals that
may be some distance away. Another benefit will be that all individuals will receive medical screening and, if an emergency
medical condition exists, will also receive stabilizing treatment and protections against inappropriate transfers
regardless of the individual's eligibility for Medicare. We believe that these provisions will improve access to
care and reduce patient complaints. The potential use of sanctions provides the incentive for hospitals to ensure
continued compliance with these provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We included a voluntary impact analysis in section VII of the preamble in the June 16, 1988 proposed rule (53 FR 22513).
We received no comments on that analysis, and we believe that none of the changes incorporated into this interim final
rule have any significant impact. Therefore, we are not preparing a similar analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that these final regulations will
not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and will not have a significant impact
on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Therefore, we have not prepared a regulatory flexibility
analysis or an analysis of effects on small rural hospitals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was reviewed by the Office of Management

VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 488.18(d), 489.20 (m) and (r), and 489.24 (c), (d) and (g) of this interim final rule contain information
collection requirements that are subject to the Office of Management and Budget review under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980. The information collections in &sect;&sect;488.18, 489.20(m), and 489.24 require the State agencies
to notify HCFA when hospitals are not in compliance with provisions contained in the Medicare provider agreement.
Section 489.20(m) also requires that a hospital report to HCFA or a Medicare state survey agency when the hospital
believes it has received an individual who has been transferred in an unstable emergency medical condition from another
hospital in violation of the requirements of &sect;489.24(d). Section 489.20(r) now requires both transferring
and receiving hospitals to develop and maintain lists of on-call physicians and central logs containing information
about what services the individual did or did not receive and applicable patient records on admissions, discharges,
and transfers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, under &sect;489.24 (c) and (d), transferring hospitals must send receiving hospitals an individual's
medical records (or copies) available at the time of the transfer, and the individual's other medical records must
be sent as soon as practicable after the transfer. The provisions also require hospitals to record certain information
on individuals' medical records, require individuals to sign consent forms pertaining to examinations, treatments
and transfers, and require physicians and other qualified medical personnel, when a physician is not present in the
emergency department but in consultation with the physician, to sign transfer certifications containing specific
information. Section 489.24(g) also requires PROs to prepare reports regarding individuals' medical conditions
when requested by HCFA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 489.27 of the proposed rule required that hospitals that participate in the Medicare program obtain from
the beneficiary or his or her representative a signed acknowledgement of receipt of a notice of discharge rights.
We also required these hospitals to retain both a copy of the inpatient notice of discharge rights (``Message'') and
of the signed acknowledgement for 1 year. As discussed in section IV.B. of this preamble, this interim final rule eliminates
the requirement for an acknowledgement statement. Thus, the accompanying recordkeeping burden also is eliminated.

IX. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requires us to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and afford prior public comment on proposed rules. Such notice includes a statement of the time, place and nature of
the rulemaking proceeding, reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed, and the terms or substance
of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved. However, this requirement does not apply
when an agency finds good cause that prior notice and comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public
interest, and incorporates a statement of the finding and its reasons in the rules instead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule with comment period includes a number of revisions to our regulations that implement revisions
to the Act under OBRA 89 and OBRA 90 and for which we did not propose rulemaking. These particular regulation revisions
implement the statute without interpretation; the statutory changes are self-implementing. Most of the revisions
are technical; some substantive ones (such as the notice hospitals are required to post concerning Medicaid) have
already been implemented; others are changes that would respond to public comments we have already received. Affording
a proposed rulemaking process under these circumstances is not in the public interest as it would delay the promulgation
of regulations that correspond to the current statute; because the statutory revisions are self-implementing,
we do not anticipate that public comment would substantively modify regulations. Therefore, we find good cause to
waive proposed rulemaking for those regulatory provisions necessary to implement OBRA 89 and OBRA 90. However, we
are providing a 60-day period for public comment, as indicated at the beginning of this rule, on changes to the regulations
resulting from the provisions of OBRA 89 and OBRA 90. After considering comments that are received timely, we will
respond to the comments, include any changes in the rule that might be necessitated in light of those comments, and
publish a final rule in the

X. Response to Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the large number of items of correspondence we receive on a rulemaking document, we are not able to acknowledge
or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified
in the ``Dates'' section of this preamble, and, we will respond to the comments in the preamble of the final rule.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the case of a hospital that has an emergency department, if any individual (whether or not eligible for Medicare
benefits and regardless of ability to pay) comes by him or herself or with another person to the emergency department
and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment of a medical condition by qualified medical
personnel (as determined by the hospital in its rules and regulations), the hospital must provide for an appropriate
medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary
services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition
exists. The examinations must be conducted by individuals determined qualified by hospital by-laws or rules and
regulations and who meet the requirements of &sect;482.55 concerning emergency services personnel and direction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Capacity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the ability of the hospital to accommodate the individual requesting examination or treatment of the transferred
individual. Capacity encompasses such things as numbers and availability of qualified staff, beds and equipment
and the hospital's past practices of accommodating additional patients in excess of its occupancy limits.

Comes to the emergency department
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means, with respect to an individual requesting examination or treatment, that the individual is on the hospital
property (property includes ambulances owned and operated by the hospital, even if the ambulance is not on hospital
grounds). An individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance on hospital property is considered to have come to the hospital's
emergency department. An individual in a nonhospital-owned ambulance off hospital property is not considered to
have come to the hospital's emergency department, even if a member of the ambulance staff contacts the hospital by
telephone or telemetry communications and informs the hospital that they want to transport the individual to the
hospital for examination and treatment. In such situations, the hospital may deny access if it is in ``diversionary
status,'' that is, it does not have the staff or facilities to accept any additional emergency patients. If, however,
the ambulance staff disregards the hospital's instructions and transports the individual on to hospital property,
the individual is considered to have come to the emergency department.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If any individual (whether or not eligible for Medicare benefits) comes to a hospital and the hospital determines
that the individual has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must provide either_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Within the capabilities of the staff and facilities available at the hospital, for further medical examination
and treatment as required to stabilize the medical condition; or

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Refusal to consent to treatment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A hospital meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section with respect to an individual if the hospital
offers the individual the further medical examination and treatment described in that paragraph and informs the
individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) of the risks and benefits to the individual of the examination
and treatment, but the individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) refuses to consent to the examination
and treatment. The medical record must contain a description of the examination, treatment, or both if applicable,
that was refused by or on behalf of the individual. The hospital must take all reasonable steps to secure the individual's
written informed refusal (or that of the person acting on his or her behalf). The written document should indicate
that the person has been informed of the risks and benefits of the examination or treatment, or both.

A hospital meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to an individual if the hospital
offers to transfer the individual to another medical facility in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and
informs the individual (or a person acting on his or her behalf) of the risks and benefits to the individual of the transfer,
but the individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) refuses to consent to the transfer. The hospital
must take all reasonable steps to secure the individual's written informed refusal (or that of a person acting on his
or her behalf). The written document must indicate the person has been informed of the risks and benefits of the transfer
and state the reasons for the individual's refusal. The medical record must contain a description of the proposed
transfer that was refused by or on behalf of the individual.

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an individual at a hospital has an emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized (as defined in paragraph
(b) of this section), the hospital may not transfer the individual unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The transfer is an appropriate transfer (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii)(A) The individual (or a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf) requests the transfer,
after being informed of the hospital's obligations under this section and of the risk of transfer. The request must
be in writing and indicate the reasons for the request as well as indicate that he or she is aware of the risks and benefits
of the transfer;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A physician (within the meaning of section 1861(r)(1) of the Act) has signed a certification that, based upon the
information available at the time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate
medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual or, in the case of a woman
in labor, to the woman or the unborn child, from being transferred. The certification must contain a summary of the
risks and benefits upon which it is based; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If a physician is not physically present in the emergency department at the time an individual is transferred,
a qualified medical person (as determined by the hospital in its by-laws or rules and regulations) has signed a certification
described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section after a physician (as defined in section 1861(r)(1) of the Act)
in consultation with the qualified medical person, agrees with the certification and subsequently countersigns
the certification. The certification must contain a summary of the risks and benefits upon which it is based.

(2) A transfer to another medical facility will be appropriate only in those cases in which_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The transferring hospital provides medical treatment within its capacity that minimizes the risks to the individual's
health and, in the case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The receiving facility_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of the individual; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The transferring hospital sends to the receiving facility all medical records (or copies thereof) related
to the emergency condition which the individual has presented that are available at the time of the transfer, including
available history, records related to the individual's emergency medical condition, observations of signs or symptoms,
preliminary diagnosis, results of diagnostic studies or telephone reports of the studies, treatment provided,
results of any tests and the informed written consent or certification (or copy thereof) required under paragraph
(d)(1)(ii) of this section, and the name and address of any on-call physician (described in paragraph (f) of this section)
who has refused or failed to appear within a reasonable time to provide necessary stabilizing treatment. Other records
(e.g., test results not yet available or historical records not readily available from the hospital's files) must
be sent as soon as practicable after transfer; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The transfer is effected through qualified personnel and transportation equipment, as required, including
the use of necessary and medically appropriate life support measures during the transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A participating hospital may not penalize or take adverse action against a physician or a qualified medical person
described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this section because the physician or qualified medical person refuses
to authorize the transfer of an individual with an emergency medical condition that has not been stabilized, or against
any hospital employee because the employee reports a violation of a requirement of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, in cases where a medical opinion is necessary to determine
a physician's or hospital's liability under section 1867(d)(1) of the Act, HCFA requests the appropriate PRO (with
a contract under Part B of title XI of the Act) to review the alleged section 1867(d) violation and provide a report on
its findings in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section. HCFA provides to the PRO all information
relevant to the case and within its possession or control. HCFA, in consultation with the OIG, also provides to the
PRO a list of relevant questions to which the PRO must respond in its report.

certified mail date on the notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The physician or hospital (or both where applicable) may request a meeting with the PRO. This meeting is not designed
to be a formal adversarial hearing or a mechanism for discovery by the physician or hospital. The meeting is intended
to afford the physician and/or the hospital a full and fair opportunity to present the views of the physician and/or
hospital regarding the case. The following provisions apply to that meeting:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The physician and/or hospital has the right to have legal counsel present during that meeting. However, the PRO
may control the scope, extent, and manner of any questioning or any other presentation by the attorney. The PRO may
also have legal counsel present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The PRO makes arrangements so that, if requested by HCFA or the OIG, a verbatim transcript of the meeting may be generated.
If HCFA or OIG requests a transcript, the affected physician and/or the affected hospital may request that HCFA provide
a copy of the transcript.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The PRO affords the physician and/or the hospital an opportunity to present, with the assistance of counsel, expert
testimony in either oral or written form on the medical issues presented. However, the PRO may reasonably limit the
number of witnesses and length of such testimony if such testimony is irrelevant or repetitive. The physician and/or
hospital, directly or through counsel, may disclose patient records to potential expert witnesses without violating
any non-disclosure requirements set forth in part 476 of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The PRO is not obligated to consider any additional information provided by the physician and/or the hospital
after the meeting, unless, before the end of the meeting, the PRO requests that the physician and/or hospital submit
additional information to support the claims. The PRO then allows the physician and/or the hospital an additional
period of time, not to exceed 5 calendar days from the meeting, to submit the relevant information to the PRO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Within 60 calendar days of receiving the case, the PRO must submit to HCFA a report on the PRO's findings. HCFA provides
copies to the OIG and to the affected physician and/or the affected hospital. The report must contain the name of the
physician and/or the hospital, the name of the individual, and the dates and times the individual arrived at and was
transferred (or discharged) from the hospital. The report provides expert medical opinion regarding whether the
individual involved had an emergency medical condition, whether the individual's emergency medical condition
was stabilized, whether the individual was transferred appropriately, and whether there were any medical utilization
or quality of care issues involved in the case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The report required under paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section should not state an opinion or conclusion as to
whether section 1867 of the Act or &sect;489.24 has been violated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If a delay would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals or when there was no screening examination, the
PRO review described in this section is not required before the OIG may impose civil monetary penalties or an exclusion
in accordance with section 1867(d)(1) of the Act and 42 CFR part 1003 of this title.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the PRO determines after a preliminary review that there was an appropriate medical screening examination
and the individual did not have an emergency medical condition, as defined by paragraph (b) of this section, then the
PRO may, at its discretion, return the case to HCFA and not meet the requirements of paragraph (g) except for those in
paragraph (g)(2)(v).

to any penalty or assessment, to an exclusion from participation in Medicare for a period of time determined under
&sect;1003.107. The OIG will also direct each appropriate State agency to exclude the person from each health care
program for the same period of time_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Any person who is subject to a penalty or assessment under &sect;1003.102 (a) or (b)(1) through (b)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any responsible physician who_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Knowingly violates section 1867 of the Act or &sect;489.24 of this title on or after December 22, 1987, but before
July 1, 1990; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Knowingly and willfully, or negligently, violates section 1867 of the Act or &sect;489.24 of this title on or after
July 1, 1990 but before May 1, 1991; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Commits a gross and flagrant, or repeated, violation of section 1867 of the Act or &sect;489.24 of this title on
or after May 1, 1991. For purposes of this section, a gross and flagrant violation is one that presents an imminent danger
to the health, safety or well-being of the individual who seeks emergency examination and treatment or places that
individual unnecessarily in a high-risk situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Nothing in this section will be construed to limit the Department's authority to impose an exclusion without imposing
a penalty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) With respect to determinations under &sect;1003.102 (b)(2) or (b)(3), or with respect to violations occurring
on or after December 22, 1987 and before July 1, 1990 under &sect;1003.105(a)(1)(ii), a physician may not be excluded
if the OIG determines that he or she is the sole community physician or the sole source of essential specialized services
in a community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) With respect to any exclusion based on liability for a penalty or assessment under &sect;1003.102 (a), (b)(1),
or (b)(4), the OIG will consider an application from a State agency for a waiver if the person is the sole community physician
or the sole source of essential specialized services in a community. With respect to any exclusion imposed under &sect;1003.105(a)(1)(ii),
the OIG will consider an application from a State agency for a waiver if the physician's exclusion from the State health
care program would deny beneficiaries access to medical care or would otherwise cause hardship to beneficiaries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a waiver is granted, it is applicable only to the State health care program for which the State requested the
waiver.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the OIG subsequently obtains information that the basis for a waiver no longer exists, or the State agency
submits evidence that the basis for the waiver no longer exists, the waiver will cease and the person will be excluded
from the State health care program for the remainder of the period that the person is excluded from Medicare.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The OIG notifies the State agency whether its request for a waiver has been granted or denied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The decision to deny a waiver is not subject to administrative or judicial review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For purposes of this section, the definitions contained in &sect;1001.2 of this chapter for ``sole community
physician'' and ``sole source of essential specialized services in a community'' apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When the Inspector General proposes to exclude a nursing facility from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, he
or she will, at the same time he or she notifies the respondent, notify the appropriate State licensing authority,
the State Office of Aging, the long-term care ombudsman, and the State Medicaid agency of the Inspector General's
intention to exclude the facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;You have the right to receive all the hospital care that is necessary for the proper diagnosis and treatment
of your illness or injury. According to Federal law, your discharge date must be determined solely by your medical
needs, not by ``Diagnosis Related Groups'' (DRGs) or Medicare payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;You have the right to be fully informed about decisions affecting your Medicare coverage and payment for your
hospital stay and for any post-hospital services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;You have the right to request a review by a Peer Review Organization (PRO) of any written Notice of Noncoverage
that you receive from the hospital stating that Medicare will no longer pay for your hospital care. PROs are groups
of doctors who are paid by the Federal Government to review medical necessity, appropriateness and quality of hospital
treatment furnished to Medicare patients. The phone number and address of the PRO for your area are:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
You and your doctor know more about your condition and your health needs than anyone else. Decisions about your medical
treatment should be made between you and your doctor. If you have any questions about your medical treatment, your
need for continued hospital care, your discharge, or your need for possible post-hospital care, don't hesitate to
ask your doctor. The hospital's patient representative or social worker will also help you with your questions and
concerns about hospital services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Ask a hospital representative for a written notice of explanation immediately, if you have not already received
one. This notice is called a Notice of Noncoverage. You must have this Notice of Noncoverage if you wish to exercise
your right to request a review by the PRO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Notice of Noncoverage will state either that your doctor or the PRO agrees with the hospital's decision
that Medicare will no longer pay for your hospital care.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
_If the hospital and your doctor agree, the PRO does not review your case before a Notice of Noncoverage is issued. But
the PRO will respond to your request for a review of your Notice of Noncoverage and seek your opinion. You cannot be made
to pay for your hospital care until the PRO makes its decision, if you request the review by noon of the first work day
after you receive the Notice of Noncoverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_If the hospital and your doctor disagree, the hospital may request the PRO to review your case. If it does make such
a request, the hospital is required to send you a notice to that effect. In this situation the PRO must agree with the
hospital or the hospital cannot issue a Notice of Noncoverage. You may request that the PRO reconsider your case after
you receive a Notice of Noncoverage, but since the PRO has already reviewed your case once, you may have to pay for at
least one day of hospital care before the PRO completes this reconsideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If you do not request a review, the hospital may bill you for all the costs of your stay beginning with the third day after
you receive the Notice of Noncoverage. The hospital, however, cannot charge you for care unless it provides you with
a Notice of Noncoverage.

_The PRO must ask for your views about your case before making its decision. The PRO will inform you by phone or in writing

Note:

The process described above is called ``immediate review.'' If you miss the deadline for this immediate review while
you are in the hospital, you may still request a review of Medicare's decision to no longer pay for your care at any point
during your hospital stay or after you have left the hospital. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 will tell you how to request this review.

Post-Hospital Care
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When your doctor determines that you no longer need all the specialized services provided in a hospital, but you still
require medical care, he or she may discharge you to a skilled nursing facility or home care. The discharge planner
at the hospital will help arrange for the services you may need after your discharge. Medicare and supplemental insurance
policies have limited coverage for skilled nursing facility care and home health care. Therefore, you should find
out which services will or will not be covered and how payment will be made. Consult with your doctor, hospital discharge
planner, patient representative, and your family in making preparations for care after you leave the hospital. Don't
hesitate to ask questions.

Appendix II_Posting of Signs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6018(a)(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89), effective July 1, 1990, requires
hospitals and rural primary care hospitals with emergency departments to post signs which specify the rights (under
section 1867 of the Social Security Act) of women in labor and individuals with emergency medical conditions to examination
and treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To comply with these requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;At a minimum, the signs must specify the rights of unstable individuals with emergency conditions and women
in labor who come to the emergency department for health care services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It must indicate whether the facility participates in the Medicaid program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The wording of the sign must be clear and in simple terms understandable by the population serviced; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Print the signs in English and other major languages that are common to the population of the area serviced;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The letters within the signs must be clearly readable at a distance of at least 20 feet or the expected vantage
point of the emergency department patrons; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Post signs in a place or places likely to be noticed by all individuals entering the emergency department, as
well as those individuals waiting for examination and treatment (e.g., entrance, admitting area, waiting room,
treatment area). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule lists communities where modification of the base (100-year) flood elevations is appropriate because
of new scientific or technical data. New flood insurance premium rates will be calculated from the modified base (100-year)
flood elevations for new buildings and their contents.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this interim rule. However, the
address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base (100-year) flood elevation determinations
are available for inspection is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any request for reconsideration must be based upon knowledge of changed conditions, or upon new scientific or technical
data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modifications are made pursuant to Section 201 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR Part 65.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes in base flood elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act because modified base (100-year) flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are required to maintain community eligibility in the NFIP. No regulatory
flexibility analysis has been prepared.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Emergency Management Agency makes the final determinations listed below of the final determinations
of modified base (100-year) flood elevations for each community listed. These modified elevations have been published
in newspapers of local circulation and ninety (90) days have elapsed since that publication. The Associate Director
has resolved any appeals resulting from this notification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this notice. However, this rule
includes the address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base (100-year) flood elevation
determinations are available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modifications are made pursuant to Section 206 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR Part 65.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP and are also used to
calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations are made
final, and for the contents in these buildings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes in base (100-year) elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act because modified base (100-year) flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are required to maintain community eligibility in the NFIP. No regulatory
flexibility analysis has been prepared.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is today amending the table of currently approved information collection request (ICR) control numbers issued
by OMB for EPA Acquisition Regulations (EPAAR). Today's amendment updates the table to accurately display those
information requirements promulgated under the EPAAR which implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulations
(FAR). The affected regulations are codified at 48 CFR part 1532. EPA will continue to present OMB control numbers
in a consolidated table format 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be codified in 48 CFR part 1501 of the EPAAR, in 40 CFR part 9 of the Agency's regulations, and in each 40 CFR volume containing
EPA regulations. The table lists the part and section numbers with reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and
the current OMB control numbers. This display of the OMB control numbers and their subsequent codification in the
Code of Federal Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ICR(s) were previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there
is ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this
table without prior notice and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would
be unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under 49 CFR 5.11, any person may petition the Secretary of Transportation to issue, amend, or repeal a rule, or for
a permanent or temporary exemption from any rule. Under 49 CFR 5.13, if the Secretary determines that the petition
contains adequate justification, he is authorized to initiate rulemaking action or grant the exemption. If the Secretary
determines that the petition does not contain adequate justification, he is authorized to deny the petition. The
Secretary is also authorized to notify the petitioner of the decision. This rule delegates to the General Counsel
the Secretary of Transportation's authority to deny a petition for rulemaking or a petition for exemption and to notify
the petitioner of the denial.

Since this rule relates to departmental management, organization, procedure, and practice, notice and public comment
are unnecessary. For the same reason, good cause exists for not publishing this rule at least 30 days before its effective
date, as is ordinarily required by 5 U.S.C. 553(d). Therefore, this rule is effective on the date of its publication.

 NMFS announces the approval of Amendment 6 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Northeast Multispecies Fishery
(FMP) and issues final regulations to implement it. This rule continues on a permanent basis three measures originally
imposed by a temporary emergency rule: A 500-lb (226.8-kg) possession limit for haddock year-round for all vessels
permitted under the FMP and for all vessels in possession of haddock from or in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ); a
prohibition on scallop dredge vessels from possessing or landing haddock from January through June; and an extension
of the time period of the closure of Closed Area II to 6 months (from January through June), rather than 4 months (February
through May), in 1995. The intended effect of this rule is to protect depleted haddock stocks.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Supplementary and background information on Amendment 6 and the proposed implementing regulations (which were
initiated by NMFS rather than the New England Fishery Management Council (Council)) was published in the preamble
to the proposed rule to implement Amendment 6 (59 FR 18092, on April 15, 1994), and is not repeated here. All three of
the measures contained in this final rule are also contained in the emergency rule that is effective through June 30,
1994 (59 FR 15656, April 4, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council voted on February 17 to begin the resubmission process for the disapproved 5,000-lb (2,268-kg) haddock
possession limit in Amendment 5 to the FMP by submitting a 750-pound (340-kg) possession limit. The 750-pound (340-kg)
limit was recommended by the Council on the basis of Plan Development Team and Council staff analysis of the haddock
fishery. The 750-pound (340-kg) limit and a proposed implementing rule were submitted to NMFS on March 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 28, 1994, NMFS disapproved the Council's 750-pound (340-kg) limit because it was determined to be inconsistent
with National Standard 1 of the Magnuson Act, which requires that management measures prevent overfishing while
achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery for the U.S. fishing industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This determination was based, in part, on data from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) that indicate
that current haddock catches are generally less than 500 pounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(226.8 kg). The Council's argument that a 750-pound (340-kg) limit would allow vessels to keep what would be discarded
anyway, therefore, was no longer relevant to this segment of the multispecies fishery. This additional information
which was available to NMFS at the time the resubmission was disapproved, but not available to the Council at the time
of its analysis, underscores the appropriateness of a 500-pound (226.8-kg) possession limit in order to ensure maximum
protection to this severely depleted resource. Accordingly, the 500-pound (226.8-kg) possession limit is included
in Amendment 6 and is implemented by this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS also determined that, because scallop vessels fish in Closed Area II during the period when haddock are congregated
to spawn, all scallop dredge vessels should be prohibited from landing or possessing haddock during the closed period
to ensure that such vessels do not target these concentrations of haddock. While the Council requested that the Regional
Director consider whether scallop dredges should be prohibited from being in the area during the closure, instead
of being prohibited from possessing or landing haddock, the information provided by the NEFSC of NMFS did not support
precluding scallopers from the closed area. Accordingly the prohibition from possessing or landing haddock is included
in Amendment 6 and is implemented by this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the resubmission package did not propose the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension of the time closure of Closed Area II. The data acquired by the NEFSC since the Council's analysis supports
an extension of the time closure in 1995, rather than beginning in 1996, as stipulated in Amendment 5. The expansion
of Closed Area II in time for 1995 will provide additional protection to the concentrations of haddock that occur in
the area. The closure of Area II beginning in January rather than February, and ending at the end of June rather than
at the end of May, should ensure that haddock beginning to concentrate in the area are provided the fullest protection.
Accordingly, an extension of the time period of the closure is included in Amendment 6 and is implemented by this final
rule.

Written comments on the proposed rule to Amendment 6 to the FMP were received by the NMFS from the Center for Marine Conservation
(CMC) and from the Council. The Council had no specific comment on the proposed rule but went on record at its May 11&hyph;12,
1994, meeting and again in writing on May 13, as supporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 6. In addition, on March 8, 1994, prior to the beginning of the comment period for the proposed rule to implement
Amendment 6, the Council submitted comments on proposed Amendment 6 and its EA/RIR.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council commented that proposed Amendment 6 and its EA/RIR had several deficiencies in content and format including:
The need for a ``Purpose and need'' section, a clear statement of objectives of the Amendment, a description of the
consistency of the Amendment with the national standards of Magnuson Act, evidence that the Amendment's possession
limit for haddock promotes efficiency in the utilization of the resource, a section describing the Amendment's relationship
to other applicable law, better evidence that the 500-pound possession limit is the proper preferred alternative
compared to several incremental amounts higher than 500 pounds, and a convincing argument justifying preparation
of an EA rather than an EIS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final EA/RIR of Amendment 6 has been revised to contain a ``Purpose and Need'' section (page 4), an improved objectives
statement (page 5), consistency of the Amendment with national standards (page 75), evidence that the 500-pound
haddock possession limit promotes efficiency of the resource, and effects of the preferred possession limit on the
resource (pages 19&hyph;27), a discussion of compliance of the Amendment with other applicable law (pages 72&hyph;76),
a comparison of the effects of the preferred alternative versus several different haddock possession limit amounts
(pages 19&hyph;37), and a convincing argument for preparation of an EA rather than an EIS (pages 38, 72, and 73).

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CMC supported the protective measures contained in Amendment 6 and suggested the possession limit on haddock
be reflected in three standard totes, consistent with the Council's recommendation from its May (1994) meeting.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council and the NMFS are aware of the need to ensure that the haddock possession limit is adhered to strictly. The
standard tote, or box, measure is currently under review to determine whether the number of totes allowed is sufficiently
equivalent to 500 lb (226.8 kg).

Changes from the Proposed Rule

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;651.9(a)(12) and (e)(34), the phrase ``or the equivalent in totes or boxes'' is added to reflect the language
in the amendment and to clarify the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 651.27(b)(1)(iii) is added to clarify who is subject to the haddock possession limit and provisions specified
in &sect;651.27(b)(2).

The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce, when this rule was proposed, certified to the Small Business Administration
that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Fishing vessels
that will be subject to this rule rarely take more than 500-lb (226.8-kg) of haddock per trip because of the severely
depleted status of the stock. Based on the most recent catch statistics, 68 percent of the fishing trips landing groundfish
landed no haddock, 84 percent involved less than 500 lb (226.8 kg). The allowable bycatch of 500 pounds (226.8 kg) is
expected to discourage vessels from targeting haddock, promoting rebuilding of the stock that will result in long
term benefits to the groundfish fleet. The measures in this rule will not result in a reduction of annual gross revenues
of more than 5 percent. Annual compliance costs are not expected to increase total costs by more than 5 percent and are
not expected to be substantially higher for small, as compared to large, business entities. The measures will not
force more than 2 percent of small business entities to cease business operations. As a result, an initial regulatory
flexibility analysis was not prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, finds that under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure
Act, there is good cause to waive part of the 30-day delay in effectiveness and make this rule effective on June 30, 1994.
This effective date will avoid a one or two-week hiatus between the effective date of this rule with a 30-day delay in
effective date and the expiration of the emergency rule on June 30, 1994, that imposes the three management measures
contained in this final rule. This will avoid confusion in the fishery, continue protection of badly depleted stocks
of haddock from further overfishing; and enhance the likelihood that abundance of those stocks begin replenishment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The implementing regulations at 50 CFR 630.24(b)(1)(i)(A) establish a quota of 69,286 lbs (31,428 kg) of swordfish
that may be harvested by drift gillnet during the period January 1 through June 30, each year. Under 50 CFR 630.25(a),
NMFS is required to close the drift gillnet fishery for swordfish when its quota is reached, or is projected to be reached,
by filing a notice with the Office of the Federal Register at least 8 days before the closure is to become effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the current level of swordfish catch by drift gillnets, historic data on average catch per set for June, and
the number of vessels fishing or expected to fish, NMFS has determined that the drift gillnet quota for the January
1 through June 30 period will be reached on or before June 25, 1994. Hence, the drift gillnet fishery for Atlantic swordfish
is closed effective 0001 hours, local time, June 25, 1994, through June 30, 1994, when a new semiannual quota becomes
available. NMFS may adjust the July 1 through December 31, 1994, drift gillnet quota to reflect actual catches made
in the January 1 through June 30, 1994, semiannual period as specified in 50 CFR 630.24.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During this closure of the drift gillnet fishery: (1) A person aboard a vessel using or having aboard a drift gillnet
may not fish for swordfish from the North Atlantic swordfish stock; (2) no more than two swordfish per trip may be possessed
in the North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, north of 5
