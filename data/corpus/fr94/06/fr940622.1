SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is proposing to amend its regulations for nonreactor licensees on decommissioning
financial assurance, and expiration and termination of licenses. These amendments are intended to clarify that
financial assurance must be in place during operations and updated when the licensee decides to cease operations
and begin decommissioning. These amendments would explicitly describe the financial assurance certification
requirements for licensees during operation, the implementation and timing requirements for licensees whose licenses
have been in timely renewal since the promulgation of the 1988 decommissioning funding rules, and for licensees who
cease operations without adequate funding arrangements in place.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1983, the Commission amended 10 CFR Parts 30, 40, and 70 to add requirements addressing ``Expiration and Termination
of Licenses'' (10 CFR 30.36, 40.42, and 70.38 (48 FR 32324; July 15,1983)). Similar provisions were added to 10 CFR
Part 72 in 1988 (10 CFR 72.54 (53 FR 24018)). These requirements set out the procedures to be followed by a licensee who
decides to decommission a facility and seek termination of the applicable license. Under certain circumstances
(which apply when a Part 30, 40, 70, or 72 licensee has more than a modest amount of radioactive contamination to remediate),
the licensee is required to submit a decommissioning plan that lays out the methods and measures for decontamination
of the property and equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1988, the Commission promulgated rules addressing ``Financial Assurance and Recordkeeping for Decommissioning''
(10 CFR 30.35, 40.36, 70.25 and 72.30 (53 FR 24018; June 27,1988)). These rules established a graded structure for
financial assurance that relates the amount of the financial assurance required of a licensee to the possession limits
in his or her license. The graded structure is based on the reasonable assumption that the kinds and quantities of radioactive
materials authorized in the license provide a reasonably good correlation to the amount of contamination that has
to be remediated. Further, Part 30, 40, or 70 applicants or licensees whose possession limits exceed or would exceed
a certain level, and all Part 72 licensees and license applicants must provide an estimate of the actual expected decommissioning
cost as part of their application for a license or for license renewal. The estimated costs are reviewed and approved
by the Commission. Before the license is issued or renewed, the applicant must provide financial assurance in one
or more of the forms required by the rule (prepayment, surety, insurance or other guarantee, or external sinking fund
with a backup surety). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same June 27, 1988, final rule also added a requirement that decommissioning plans include an updated detailed
cost estimate for decommissioning, a comparison of that estimate with present funds set aside for decommissioning,
and a plan for assuring the availability of adequate funds for the completion of decommissioning. The intent in promulgating
these rules was to ensure that adequate funds would be available to cover the costs of decommissioning NRC licensed
facilities. At the time the decommissioning funding rules were promulgated, it was not anticipated that a licensee
would move to decommissioning without having complied earlier with the financial assurance requirements. Since
that time a number of licensees who were in timely renewal (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., licensees who had timely filed an application for renewal of their licenses and whose licenses, therefore, continued
in effect while the renewal applications were being acted upon) when the June 27, 1988, rule became effective have
decided to terminate their activities and begin decommissioning. Other licensees that only provided certification
for the minimum amounts of financial assurance have also decided to terminate activities and begin decommissioning.
In both situations, insufficient funding was in place when the licensee ceased operations and began decommissioning.
These amendments are intended to clarify that financial assurances must be in place and updated when the licensee
decides to cease operations and begin decommissioning.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments proposed here would amend those sections in 10 CFR Parts 30, 40, 70, and 72 dealing with assurance of
adequate funding for decommissioning. These changes would more explicitly describe the implementation and timing
requirements for licensee financial assurance instruments and clarify that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Licensees who have applied for license renewal must provide financial assurance for decommissioning during
the period that they remain in timely renewal. This is addressed through the addition of Paragraph (c)(4) to &sect;&sect;30.35,
40.36, and 70.25. Licensees currently in timely renewal would need to have the required financial assurance instrument
when this rule if adopted as a final rule, becomes effective, 90 days after publication of the final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Specific comments are solicited on the adequacy of the 90 day time period for licensees currently in timely renewal
to obtain the required financial assurance instrument; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each decommissioning funding plan must include a certification by the licensee that financial assurance for
decommissioning has been provided in the amount of the cost estimate. This is addressed through a modification to
Paragraph (e) of &sect;&sect;30.35, 40.36, and 70.25; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The decommissioning financial assurances provided by the licensee in conjunction with a license renewal or issuance
must remain in effect during the period of decommissioning and must be increased or may be decreased, as appropriate,
within 90 days of the licensee notice of termination of activities and request to terminate the license. This is necessary
to cover the detailed estimated decommissioning costs developed as part of the decommissioning plan. This is addressed
through the addition of Paragraph (b)(2) to &sect;&sect;30.36, 40.42, and 70.38, and Paragraph (a)(2) to &sect;72.54;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any licensee who submits a notice of termination of activities and request to terminate the license, and has not
provided appropriate financial assurance for decommissioning, shall do so within 90 days of the notice. This is addressed
through the addition of a new Paragraph (b)(2)(i) to &sect;&sect;30.36, 40.42, and 70.38, and Paragraph (a)(2)(i)
to &sect;72.54. Any licensee who has already submitted a notice of termination of activities and request to terminate
the license would need to have the required financial assurance instrument when this rule, if adopted as a final rule,
becomes effective, 90 days after publication of the final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Licensees may reduce the amount of financial assurance semiannually as decommissioning proceeds and radiological
contamination is reduced at the site, with the approval of the Commission. This is addressed through the addition
of a new Paragraph (b)(2)(ii) to &sect;&sect;30.36, 40.42, and 70.38, and Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) to &sect;72.54.
The semiannual interval is proposed as a balance between the financial incentive that this provision gives to licensees
to proceed promptly with the decommissioning work after approval of the decommissioning plan and the burden imposed
on both the licensee and staff in implementing a reduction. Specific comments are solicited on the interval proposed.

Regulatory Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has prepared this proposed regulation to clarify its decommissioning funding requirements for persons
licensed under Parts 30, 40, 70, and 72. Although it does alter existing requirements, regulatory analyses developed
in support of prior decommissioning regulations remain valid and appropriate for this rulemaking because these
analyses assumed that all licensees would submit a certification of financial assurance to the NRC of a rule prescribed
amount, or licensee estimated and NRC approved amount, necessary to provide adequate funds to decommission the licensed
facility and that licensees would have complied with the decommissioning funding requirements prior to ceasing
operations and commencing decommissioning. These prior analyses, developed for the rules on expiration and termination
licenses and financial assurances for decommissioning, remain available for inspection in the NRC Public Document
Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. This discussion constitutes the regulatory analysis for
this proposed rule.

Regulatory Flexibility Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the NRC carefully considered the effect on
small entities in developing the final rule on decommissioning funding and scaled the requirements to reduce the
impact on small entities to the extent possible while adequately protecting health and safety. Therefore, it is not
expected to have an impact on licensees not already analyzed in the regulatory flexibility analysis for the decommissioning
funding rule as published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 27, 1988 (53 FR 24018). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission certifies that this proposed rule, if adopted, will not have any additional significant
economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities.

Backfit Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this rule, and therefore, a backfit analysis
is not required for this rule because these amendments do not involve any provisions which would impose backfits as
defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under OTS's capital rule, 12 CFR 567.1, common stockholders' equity, the primary component of core capital for most
savings associations, includes items that are generally the same as the items that comprised GAAP equity, when the
capital rule was adopted. Today's proposal would revise the OTS's definition of common stockholders' equity in order
to incorporate a change in GAAP made by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, in May 1993, when it issued SAFAS
No. 115.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SFAS No. 115 requires that most debt and equity securities be reported at fair value, rather than at amortized cost.
It supersedes SFAS No. 12, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accounting for Certain Marketable Securities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When SFAS No. 115 becomes effective,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities will be included in GAAP equity. On August 10, 1993,
the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council announced that it will adopt SFAS No. 115, and that it will
require all federally supervised banks and savings associations to adopt SFAS No. 115. The OTS and the Federal banking
regulatory agencies announced their intention to proposed amendments to their respective capital rules to make
the rules reflect the accounting and reporting standards contained in SFAS No. 115.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
SFAS No. 115 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. SFAS No. 115, however, includes
early adoption provisions, under which savings associations may adopt its standards as early as June 30, 1993, depending
on when their fiscal years end.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(2) of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 (HOLA), 12 U.S.C. 1463(b)(2), requires the OTS to prescribe accounting
standards that ``incorporate [GAAP] to the same degree that such principles are used to determine compliance with
regulations prescribed by the Federal banking agencies.'' The proposal revises the OTS definition of common stockholders'
equity so that it will be consistent with the change in GAAP made by SFAS No. 115. It is similar to amendments the other
Federal banking agencies have proposed to their respective capital rules in order to incorporate the modification
of GAAP made by SFAS No. 115.

II. Comment Solicitation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS solicits comment on all aspects of the proposal, but is particularly interested in comments on the following
specific questions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. If the SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses are included in regulatory capital, how should OTS include these
adjustments in its calculations?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Should SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses be included in core capital for purposes of the leverage ratio requirement?

b. Should SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses be included in core capital for purposes of the risk-based capital
requirement?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Should SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses be included in supplementary capital for purposes of the risk-based
capital requirement?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Should SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses be included in capital for purposes of Prompt Corrective Action
(PCA)? If so, should the OTS initiate a rulemaking to amend the PCA capital definitions (i.e., tangible equity) or
capital categories to ameliorate the statutory effects resulting from the potential volatility due to SFAS No. 115
adjustments?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What changes, if any, in asset-liability management, or risk management, would likely result from the inclusion
of SFAS No. 115 unrealized gains and losses in capital? Would such changes increase or decrease the risk to the Savings
Association Insurance Fund?

III. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 5 U.S.C. 601), it is certified
that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small savings associations.
This proposed regulation simply revises the definition of common stockholders' equity included in the OTS capital
rule so that it will include a new component of GAAP equity that was added to GAAP equity by SFAS No. 115. Section 4(b)(2)
of HOLA requires the OTS to promulgate accounting standards that incorporate GAAP standards to the same degree that
those standards are used by the Federal banking agencies.

The Director of the OTS has determined that this proposed rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' for purposes
of Executive Order 12866. The OTS proposes to revise its capital definition, in order to bring it into conformity with
SFAS No. 115, and to ensure that its definition of common stockholders' equity is consistent with those of the other
Federal banking agencies.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft
Model S&hyph;58 and S&hyph;58T series helicopters. This proposal would require the removal and replacement of the
transmission main gear box ring gear (ring gear) within certain time intervals and would establish a retirement life
for the ring gear. This proposal is prompted by reports of failures of the ring gear due to slow-growth fatigue cracks.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the ring gear, failure of the main transmission,
and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft
Model S&hyph;58 and S&hyph;58T series helicopters. There have been four failures of the transmission main gear box
ring gear (ring gear), part number (P/N) S1635&hyph;20058&hyph;2, reported by the manufacturer. The failures were
caused by a slow-growth fatigue crack in a single tooth on the drive side of the ring gear. The ring gear is a critical
part in the main transmission. Therefore, any cracks in the teeth of the ring gear create an unsafe condition. This
condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the ring gear, failure of the main transmission, and subsequent
loss of control of the helicopter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Sikorsky Aircraft Alert Service Bulletin No. 58B35&hyph;32, dated July 6, 1993,
that describes procedures for removal and replacement of the ring gear, provides a new mandatory retirement life
for the ring gear, provides for originating a component time-in-service record, and provides for marking a permanent
serial number on zero-time and replacement ring gears as well as ring gears removed for servicing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require removing and replacing the ring gear within certain time intervals, establishing
a mandatory retirement life of 2,500 hours' total time-in-service, originating a component service record, and
marking a serial number on the ring gear, P/N S1635&hyph;20058&hyph;2. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 125 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
31.5 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $2,000 per ring gear. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $466,562. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent failure of the transmission main gear box ring gear (ring gear), failure of the main transmission, and subsequent
loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Within the next 25 hours' time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, accomplish the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) From component records, determine the TIS for the ring gear, part number (P/N) S1635&hyph;20058&hyph;2, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the TIS on the ring gear is 2,400 or more hours' on the effective date of this AD, replace it with an airworthy serialized
ring gear within the next 100 hours' TIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the TIS on the ring gear is less than 2,400 hours' on the effective date of this AD, replace it with an airworthy
serialized ring gear at or before reaching 2,500 hours' TIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the TIS on the ring gear cannot be determined, replace it in accordance with the time since last overhaul (TSO)
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the TSO on the ring gear is 1,150 or more hours' on the effective date of this AD, replace it with an airworthy serialized
ring gear within the next 100 hours' TIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the TSO on the ring gear is less than 1,150 hours' on the effective date of this AD, replace with an airworthy serialized
ring gear at or before reaching 1,250 hours' TSO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Create a component log and a serial number and apply the serial number to the ring gear between the ring gear flanges
in accordance with Paragraph B of the Accomplishment Instructions of Sikorsky Aircraft Alert Service No. 58B35&hyph;32
(ASB 58B35&hyph;32), dated July 6, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Create a component log and a serial number for replacement ring gears and apply the serial number to the ring gear
between the ring gear flanges in accordance with Paragraph B of the Accomplishment Instructions of the ASB 58B35&hyph;32,
dated July 6, 1993, prior to installing a replacement ring gear on the helicopter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) This AD establishes a retirement life of 2,500 hours' TIS for the ring gear. However, ring gears with 2,400 or more
hours' TIS or, if the TIS cannot be determined, 1,150 or more hours' TSO on the effective date of this AD, need not be retired
until on or before the accumulation of an additional 100 hours' TIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Boston Aircraft Certification Office, FAA. Operators shall submit
their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager,
Boston Aircraft Certification Office.

This action withdraws the Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) which proposed to modify Class D airspace near Traverse
City, Michigan to change the operating times of the controlled airspace from continuous to parttime. The NPRM is being
withdrawn because the modification is contained in another regulatory airspace action, Docket No. 94&hyph;AGL&hyph;16.

The Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On May 6, 1994, an NPRM was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to modify the official description of the Class D airspace associated with the Cherry Capital Airport, Traverse City,
Michigan. The modification was to allow a variation to the class D airspace effective times to coincide with the operating
hours of the Traverse City ATCT (99 FR 23642). The NPRM is being withdrawn since this section is contained in Airspace
Docket No. 94&hyph;AGL&hyph;16, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at St. James Municipal Airport, St. James, MN, to accommodate a Nondirectional Beacon (NDB), Runway 32.
Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The intended
effect of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures from other aircraft
operating in visual weather conditions. Aeronautical maps and charts would reflect the defined area which would
enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable visual flight rules requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

1. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 7, 1994 (59 FR 1062), NOAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the natural resource damage
assessment and restoration regulations required by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. NOAA requested comments, recommendations,
and technical information concerning appropriate assessment procedures and the overall assessment process. NOAA
also announced a series of regional meetings to discuss and solicit comments on the proposed rule (59 FR 1189). On March
1, 1994, NOAA extended the comment period to July 7, 1994 (59 FR 9688). Through today's Notice, NOAA announces a further
extension of the comment period to October 7, 1994. A summary of information gathered at the previously announced
regional meetings and specific issues on which NOAA seeks further comment will appear in a future Notice.

II. Comment Period for Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since its first extension of time for public comment from April 7, 1994 to July 7, 1994, NOAA has received numerous requests
from States and other interested parties to extend the comment period for the proposed rule. As in the previous extension
requests, most requesters need more time to review the compensation formulas and its supporting documentation.
In addition, some requesters need additional time to review the body of literature supporting NOAA's proposal for
the use of contingent valuation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA is dedicated to encouraging a thorough and thoughtful review of all components of the proposed rule, and in particular
review and comment on the proposed compensation formulas and the economic methodology for estimating lost nonuse
values known as contingent valuation. Therefore, the comment period for the proposed rule on natural resource damage
assessment under the OPA is extended for ninety days. Comments on the proposed rule are now due on or before October
7, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA is coordinating its rulemaking with a rulemaking being conducted by the Department of the Interior (DOI). DOI
has published a proposed natural resource damage assessment rule under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) and the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251
et seq.). (59 FR 23097) In a separate Notice in today's

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, DOI is announcing the extension of the comment period on its proposed rule. The standards proposed for the assessment
of lost nonuse values contained in DOI's proposed rule are identical to those proposed by NOAA. Commenters on NOAA's
proposed standards for use of the economic methodology known as contingent valuation are encouraged to submit copies
of their comments both to NOAA, at the address provided at the beginning of this Notice, and to DOI at the address specified
in its notice appearing elsewhere in today's

., provides for the prevention of, liability for, removal of, and compensation for the discharge, or substantial
threat of discharge, of oil into or upon the navigable waters of the United States, adjoining shorelines, or the Exclusive
Economic Zone. Section 1006(e) requires the President, acting through the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans
and Atmosphere, to develop regulations establishing procedures for natural resource trustees to use in the assessment
of damages for injury to, destruction of, loss of, or loss of use of natural resources covered by OPA. Section 1006(b)
provides for the designation of federal, state, Indian tribe and foreign natural resource trustees to determine
resource injuries, assess natural resource damages (including the reasonable costs of assessing damages), present
a claim, recover damages, and develop and implement a plan for the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or
acquisition of the equivalent of the injured natural resources under their trusteeship.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule summarizes the written comments received by the agency and issues raised during the public meetings
and workshops, responds to those comments, and contains proposed regulatory language on the various issues raised.
Many of the specific comments summarized in the proposed rule refer to the status report published by NOAA in the March
13, 1992,

 Notice. Within the preamble to the proposed rule, NOAA specifically listed a series of issues that were raised during
the various meetings and comments (at 59 FR 1071&hyph;1074). The goal of this statement of issues of interest was to
stimulate discussions on some of the more intriguing suggestions considered in developing the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After publication of the proposed rule, NOAA held six regional meetings in January and February of 1994 in New Orleans,
Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco, and Seattle. These meetings began with a discussion of the issues identified
in the preamble to the proposed rule, but were open to discussion of other issues. There was a diverse turnout, interest,
and response at those meetings. In response to requests from many interested parties, on March 1, 1994, NOAA extended
the comment period on the proposed rule to July 7, 1994. (59 Fed Reg 9688) A final workshop on March 25, 1994, was held
in Washington, D.C. A set of discussion papers was distributed at the Washington meeting. These discussion papers
reflected issues and questions raised during the regional meetings. The discussion papers were not intended to reflect
final agency position on any issue. Instead, they were intended to focus on some relevant questions raised by the rulemaking
to date. Although the Washington, D.C. meeting emphasized the issues presented in those papers, discussions on other
concerns were encouraged. These discussion papers have been incorporated into this Notice.

included federal, state, Indian, and foreign trustees, industry, protection and indemnity (P&amp;I) clubs, environmental
groups, and private citizens. Information disseminated for the workshops included NOAA's proposed rule, an outline
of the proposed rule, a draft memorandum of agreement, and an agenda for the workshops. The purpose of the agenda was
to reach agreement on many of the issues of cooperative NRDA through open discussion among participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Notice provides a summary of information, concerns and recommendations received by NOAA at the workshops and
requests further comment on specific issues raised by NOAA and members of the public at the workshops. In addition,
this Notice makes available to the public a document summarizing the proceedings at the six workshops on cooperative
damage assessment. The document entitled ``Summary Report of Six Cooperative Natural Resource Damage Assessment
Workshops'' is available upon request to the address provided above.

Sections 1002(a) and (b)(2) of OPA establish the elements for a natural resource damage claim. Under OPA, a party responsible
for a vessel or facility is liable if there is (1) a discharge or a substantial threat of discharge (2) of oil (3) from
the vessel or facility (4) into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or the Exclusive Economic Zone. Damages
are measured in terms of the injury to natural resources resulting from such an incident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Damages resulting from an incident include those associated with injury to, destruction of, loss of, and loss of use
of natural resources. OPA adds the phrase ``loss of use of'' which is not explicit under CERCLA. The proposed rule defines
``injury'' to incorporate these concepts. The damage assessment process as under the proposed rule is designed to:
determine if there is an injury to a natural resource (Injury Determination), and subsequently quantify the extent
of those injuries (Injury Quantification). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OPA proposed rule defines ``injury'' as ``any adverse change in a natural resource or impairment of a service provided
by a resource.'' While measurement is not required for Injury Determination, it is usually needed for Injury Quantification.
It is necessary to quantify the injury to provide the basis for restoration and determine the extent or amount of damages.
Injury Quantification also may be relevant in establishing that the natural resource injuries resulted from or were
caused by the incident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast to the definition under the proposed rule, ``injury'' under the CERCLA regulations is generally defined
as ``a measurable adverse change, either long- or short-term, in the chemical or physical quality or the viability
of a natural resource resulting either directly or indirectly from exposure to a discharge of oil or release of a hazardous
substance, or exposure to a product of reactions resulting from the discharge of oil or release of a hazardous substance.''
The CERCLA regulations provide specific injury definitions for various categories of natural resources in the Injury
Determination Phase.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OPA proposed rule specifies that an injury resulting from the incident is demonstrated in the case of direct exposure,
if: (a) the natural resource was exposed, (b) there is a pathway between the discharge and exposed natural resource,
and (c) the exposure of oil, its components, or by-products have been shown by rigorous and appropriate scientific
methodology to have an adverse effect on the natural resource in laboratory experiments or the field. In the absence
of direct exposure, an injury resulting from the incident is demonstrated if: (a) the adverse effect on or impaired/diminished
use of a natural resource has been shown by rigorous and appropriate scientific methodology; and (b) the adverse effect
on or impaired/diminished use of the natural resource would not have occurred but for the discharge or threat of a discharge.
This definition differs from the corresponding definition under the CERCLA rule (43 CFR 11.62(b)-(f)), but this
difference should not produce inconsistencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA is developing guidance on the types of adverse effects that are associated with discharges of oil in a technical
support document for Injury Determination and Quantification. Generally, when attempting to determine whether
there is an injury, quantify that injury, and evaluate whether the injury is a type of injury associated with the discharge
of oil, the trustee should identify those adverse effects that meet certain ``acceptance criteria.'' Factors that
are relevant in choosing a methodology to use to demonstrate adverse effect include the extent to which that methodology
has been able to demonstrate adverse effect in the laboratory or field, and the scientific appropriateness of that
methodology.

Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The discussions at the regional workshops and the Washington, D.C. meeting focused on whether trustees should be
required to ``measure'' an adverse change in order to show injury under OPA. NOAA presenters discussed the distinction
between establishing ``liability'' under OPA and proving ``damages.'' Participants indicated that the proposed
rule should explain the distinction better than it does now. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue of concern to many participants was the perception that some biological effects or responses to exposure
to oil are produced in the laboratory but are not reflected in field studies. There was some criticism that the proposed
rule allowed unobserved biological responses to be characterized as ``injury'' to natural resources and that this
amounted to assessing damages for a ``risk of injury'' rather than actual injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that OPA required the injury to be of the type that required restoration or be relevant to restoration
before damages would be owed a trustee. This commenter suggested that adverse effects on natural resources were not
enough by themselves, that the adverse effects had to require restoration in order to constitute injury under OPA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One participant argued that OPA is a civil damages statute imposing tort liability and therefore requires a demonstration
of injury-in-fact on-site to result in damages. It was also suggested that the proposed rule presumed injury if a discharge
of oil occurs and that NOAA has no statutory authority for such a presumption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does NOAA's proposed definition of ``injury'' reflect the general understanding of the term in the scientific
and legal community? Should NOAA define ``adverse change?'' If yes, how? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does NOAA's proposed definition of ``injury'' presume injury or must the trustee present evidence of ``injury''
for purposes of establishing damages under OPA? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. NOAA's proposed rule includes a definition of the phrase ``injury resulting from a discharge of oil'' (see 59 Fed.
Reg. 1169). OPA section 1002 provides that liability is for removal costs and damages ``that result from such incident.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Does NOAA's proposed definition of ``injury resulting from a discharge'' mingle the concepts of ``injury'' with
``causation?''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Does the proposed definition mingle concepts of legal causation with scientific premises for establishing cause-in-fact?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Should NOAA provide a regulatory definition of ``injury resulting from...such incident...''? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Should NOAA limit its regulatory approach to describing acceptable ways trustee and responsible parties may develop
evidence of injury ``resulting from'' an incident; i.e.''acceptance criteria?''

4. NOAA has suggested that where multiple factors may have contributed to the injury, the injury be viewed as ``resulting
from'' the discharge or incident if the discharge, or incident was a factor contributing to the injury. Should this
view of the ``contributing factor'' test be included in either ``acceptance criteria'' or a definition of ``injury''
or some other appropriate place in the regulations?

Compensation Formulas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule is designed to provide a new simple and cost-effective damage assessment procedure for small discharges_compensation
formulas for both estuarine/marine and inland waters. The proposed compensation formulas would be applicable to
the vast majority of oil discharges and for a wide range of the most commonly discharged oil products. An analysis of
reported coastal discharges of oil shows that 99.8% of the discharges were less than 50,000 gallons and 99% were less
than 10,000 gallons. Compensation formulas would be used for most of these relatively small discharges. These formulas
provide an estimate of damages per gallon taking into account average restoration costs, plus average lost direct
use values pending restoration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For various reasons, passive use values are not included in these formulas at this time. The damages calculated with
the formulas vary with the amount and type of oil discharged and region and habitat type in which the discharge occurs.
This approach allows both national consistency and regional specificity. By comparing the habitat of the actual
discharge with the geographical province and specific habitat used to estimate the damages in the formula, the trustee
should, in most cases, find the most applicable scenario. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The simplified damage assessment procedures produce calculations based on statistical averages and are designed
to reasonably reflect the damages of the actual injury in a timely and economical manner. However, any time a simplified
assessment is used, it is unlikely that the exact circumstances of an actual discharge will be represented. Although
the damage calculation is designed to be correct on average, in some cases, the formula will over-state or under-state
the damages. In cases where the circumstances of an actual discharge are determined to be well beyond the parameters
of the compensation formula, the trustee should consider the use of another assessment procedure.

Summary of Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There was a wide range of comment on NOAA's proposed use of the compensation formulas for spills of less than 50,000
gallons. The comments ranged from NOAA's lack of statutory authority to use such formulas to the notion that the compensation
formulas are a ``black box used to club the RP'' into settlement. Other participants focused on the predictability
the compensation formulas will bring to the process of assessing smaller spills and the cost effectiveness of using
the formulas for locations where access is difficult. One participant noted that it was unreasonable for NOAA to rely
on formulaic averages when the state of science is insufficient to develop predictive models. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several suggestions were made at the workshops. It was recommended that NOAA provide guidance or criteria for proceeding
from pre-assessment to the assessment phase, as well as guidance for the use of the compensation formulas. In particular,
it was suggested that NOAA provide guidance on when the formula should be used and when the Type A model should be used,
as sometimes the Type A model resulted in lower damages than the formulas. It was also suggested that NOAA develop a
set of appropriate, ``off-the-shelf'' studies for the trustees to use in small spills to confirm actual injury. One
commenter stated that the formulas resulted in extraordinarily high per gallon damage figures for certain hypothetical
spills. It was suggested that these worst case scenarios were damaging NOAA's credibility and would affect industry's
view of the simplified procedures generally. To address this problem, the commenter recommended NOAA develop a ceiling
or cap for dollars per gallon spilled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions were received as to how the various state formulas and NOAA's proposed formulas would compare or work together,
and what to do when a complex assessment results in lower damages than the formulas or the Type A model. Lastly, some
comments and questions were posed as to when and how the compensation formulas could be attacked in litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Specific questions on which NOAA is seeking comment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed compensation formulas are based upon various representative province/habitat combinations. Since
the compensation formulas are based upon averages, it is impossible to include all known coastal habitats and every
combination of discharges. By comparing the habitat of the actual discharge with the province and specific habitat
used to estimate the damages in the formula, the trustee should, in most cases, find the most applicable scenario.
However, any time a simplified assessment is used, the exact circumstances of an actual discharge will only be approximated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there is no direct statutory language calling for this form of assessment procedure, NOAA recognized the
need for such a procedure. NOAA emphasizes that the primary advantages of a compensation formula are simplicity and
cost-effectiveness. Are the values of simplicity and cost-effectiveness in the compensation formulas outweighed
by their inherent technical limitations? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The compensation formulas were developed after extensive review of the scientific and economic literature, with
particular emphasis on restoration of various habitat types. This information was then compiled to be used with both
the current Type A model for Coastal and Marine Environments and a draft version of the Type A model under development
for the Great Lakes Environments, which provide the basis for the compensation formulas. Was this procedure for developing
the formulas appropriate and reasonable?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Because NOAA's proposed rule may be published as a final rule before the Department of the Interior (DOI) publishes
the two Type A models as final rules, NOAA is seeking comment on three options: (1) Publish the formulas as final rules,
with the option to revise once the DOI Type A models are promulgated as final rules; (2) publish the formulas as interim
final rules, pending revision based upon the completion of the Type A models; or (3) reserve the formulas as proposed
rules pending the completion of the Type A models, with the rest of the NOAA rule being published as a final rule; or (4)
repropose each formula after the model upon which it is based is published as a proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. NOAA is proposing that the damages generated by the compensation formulas be conclusive in nature for those resources
and/or services covered by the formulas. That is, once the rule becomes final and survives any judicial review, parties
may challenge the information used in applying the formulas in a particular assessment or the appropriateness of
using the formula for a specific incident, but may not challenge the underlying algorithms and data used in developing
the formulas. NOAA is specifically seeking comment on this approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Passive use (nonuse) values are not included in the formulas at this time, since NOAA determined that sufficient
information does not currently exist concerning average passive use values applicable to the compensation formula
approach. NOAA decided to propose the formulas without passive use values so that they would be available for trustee
use rather than delay proposing to a future date. The trustee, of course, may use some other assessment method to estimate
lost passive values. NOAA specifically requests comments on how such passive values might be included in the compensation
formulas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Several simplified natural resource damage assessment schemes have been developed by State trustees over the
last few years to estimate damages to natural resources resulting from discharges of oil. How may any inconsistencies
among the various State assessment methods and NOAA's proposed rule be addressed through NOAA's rulemaking?

Regional Restoration Plans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1006(f) of OPA requires that sums recovered as damages be used to develop and implement a plan for the restoration,
rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the injured natural resources. The proposed rule allows the trustees
either to develop an Incident-Specific Restoration Plan to address the effects of the incident of concern, or to pool
recoveries to apply them to a Regional Restoration Plan. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regional plans could be developed on a geographical or ecosystem basis to allow the recovery of the system covered
by the plan. Where such a plan already exists (i.e., National Estuary Program (NEP), established by Congress in 1987;
includes 21 estuaries), whether developed through prespill planning efforts or under regular management efforts,
that plan may be used if it is developed through a public review and comment process that considers the major factors
contained in the restoration planning guidance in the rule. The restoration action must address similar or comparable
resource injuries as those identified in the assessment procedure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In NOAA's view, there are a number of benefits to aggregating recovered monies in a regional restoration plan. First,
it is not cost-effective for trustees to attempt to restore natural resources affected by oil if those restored resources
are still going to be at risk from other pollutant sources that trustees have no authority to address. This problem
is less likely to arise when a regional restoration plan is used because regional plans are more likely to include a
wide range of federal, state, and local enforcement authorities to address pollutant sources (i.e., point and nonpoint
sources) affecting the region in question. Second, the trustees could also benefit from information gathered by
the regional planning process conducted by other agencies (i.e., EPA's Comprehensive Conservation and Management
Plans developed under the NEP) in efficiently and effectively addressing injured resources. Third, where a coordinated
structure involving both public and private parties already exists, it is prudent to take advantage of that structure
for public review of trustee restoration plans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments centered on the accountability of trustees for monies in a regional restoration pool and protections necessary
to prevent monies intended for restoration from being used for other purposes. In general, there was suspicion that
the regional restoration funds would be siphoned off for non-restoration-related purposes or for research projects
related to natural resource damage assessment. One commenter stated that NOAA has no statutory authority for pooling
recoveries and that each recovery must be spent for the restoration of resources injured by a particular incident.
One suggestion received was that pooled recoveries be permitted only on a consensual basis with each responsible
party. Another suggestion was that a time limit be imposed on trustees for the expenditure of pooled restoration monies.

Specific questions on which NOAA is seeking comment:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Is it likely that these regional plans would be useful in areas with long-term pollution effects, where damages
from a single incident would be too small to ``restore'' the injured natural resources or where the planning costs
for the restoration after a single incident would be quite high compared to the damage figure? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is pooling of funds contrary to the principles of restitution or compensatory damages? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the use of such regional plans contradict section 1006(f) that ``there be a nexus between monies recovered
resulting from a particular spill and their use to restore or enhance the specific resources `affected by a discharge.'''?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. May some percentage of the ``pooled'' funds be used to pay for the planning costs to develop such plans, since the
estimated restoration costs from the underlying incidents do include planning costs?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1006(c) of OPA requires federal, state, tribal and foreign trustees to ``develop and implement a plan for
the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement or acquisition of the equivalent, of the natural resources under
their trusteeship.'' 33 U.S.C. 1006 (c)(1),(2),(3), and (4). In addition, OPA provides that such ``[p]lans shall

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (emphasis added). In NOAA's view, OPA requires restoration planning to proceed like any other federal statutorily-mandated
planning activity_in the sunshine, subject to review under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), and in compliance
with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and other applicable federal
laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To fulfill the trustee obligations for restoration planning NOAA has proposed a process for the development of an
administrative record documenting all aspects of an incident relevant to the trustee obligation to restore, rehabilitate,
replace, or acquire the equivalent natural resources. In NOAA's view an administrative record for injury assessment
and selection of restoration alternatives achieves four important objectives: (1) It provides a central repository,
open to the public, for all scientific data relevant to the incident; (2) it facilitates public participation; (3)
it documents trustee decisionmaking and selection among alternatives to restore, replace or acquire the equivalent;
and (4) it minimizes transaction costs by encouraging an open, participatory process for the ultimate resolution
(i.e. restoration of natural resources) of an incident rather than resolution through litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA's attempt to minimize transaction costs and discourage complex litigation and other activities not leading
to restoration of natural resources is born of the unsatisfactory experience of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exxon Valdez 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
oil spill. In that incident all parties were criticized by the public for maintaining the confidentiality of scientific
studies, conducting science for purpose of litigation, and then settling the case without providing for the release
of the scientific data gathered. It is generally accepted that such a process does not serve the resources, the public,
or the responsible party well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA's proposed rule seeks to address these problems by providing for a contemporaneous public repository of scientific
data for injury assessment and restoration activities. As presently proposed, the administrative record documents
trustee decisionmaking processes for injury assessment, selection of restoration activities, the trustee costs,
and anticipated costs of restoration, and may include the economic valuation of injury resulting from the incident.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an open record process, subject to the opportunity for public hearing and comment, NOAA intends the trustee's selection
of restoration activities, and their costs, to be available for judicial review under the Administrative Procedure
Act. The standard for judicial review under the APA in an informal rulemaking context is whether the actions of the
trustee were ``arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA has taken the position that NEPA should be implemented during the restoration planning process and integrated
into the development of the Draft Assessment Restoration Plan (DARP). It is NOAA's view that those procedures normally
contemplated as part of the DARP can be framed and addressed as NEPA analysis and full NEPA compliance achieved without
additional paperwork or data collection. A concise analysis of available restoration alternatives and the consequences
of their implementation in the post-spill environment should form the heart of the DARP document as well as any NEPA
document with which it may be combined.

Public comment on the proposed DARP was varied. Some commenters suggested NOAA prepare a guidance document with a
standardized format and criteria for information to be included in the record. Another participant suggested that
NOAA refer to the EPA guidance for preparation of an administrative record. Commenters felt that organization and
cross-referencing mechanisms were important if the record was to be useful to people in the field.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters discussed the importance of including all available data and the QA/QC criteria in the record.
It was often stated that from the scientist's point of view, there is no reason not to put all data in the record as long
as it is accompanied by sound study design, appropriate sampling and QA/QC protocols and a description of the level
of review. Another commenter suggested that a standing peer review committee should review data before it is entered
in the record. One participant asked whether or how the record could contain useful information or documents that
do not meet pure chain of custody requirements. There was some concern raised about parties ``stuffing'' or ``dumping''
material in the record to force the other party to respond or overwhelm the other party. Another concern raised was
that the proposed rule does not require the trustee to invite responsible party participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some participants stated that the proposed administrative record process would promote litigation rather than
reduce transaction costs. There was a strong feeling on the part of some commenters that NOAA's position that the administrative
record would receive judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act using the standard of ``arbitrary and
capricious'' was fundamentally unfair to the responsible party and a violation of due process. Several commenters
felt the trustees had too much flexibility and too much control over the contents of the record. Some commenters felt
the responsible party was entitled to challenge the trustee's decisions on a ``preponderance of the evidence'' before
a jury. Another commenter suggested NOAA set up an adjudicative process where an administrative law judge would preside
and apply the ``substantial evidence'' standard to the trustee's record and allow extra-record evidence to be produced
at an administrative trial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally it was suggested that federal trustees need not comply with NEPA because the DARP would qualify under the ``functional
equivalency'' doctrine. Another commenter queried whether the responsible party would have to bear the costs of
NEPA compliance.

Specific questions on which NOAA is seeking comment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Should trustee decisionmaking on the record include all aspects of injury assessment and restoration/replacement
activities including financial costs and economic valuation or should the trustee decisions on the record include
only the injury assessment and restoration/replacement activities excluding a determination of costs and economic
values as aspects of money damages suitable for de novo trial along with liability? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is a ``bifurcated'' review process practical, i.e. will an administrative record review for injury assessment
and restoration selection and a separate litigation-driven process for determination of liability and money damages
prove workable or raise significant timing issues and evidentiary problems? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Is a trial appropriate for determination of liability and/or money damages under OPA? Is a trial appropriate for
review or litigation of trustee's decisions during injury assessment and selection of restoration activities?
If yes, should such a trial be to the court or to the jury? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Is the administrative record process for developing the trustee's assessment and/or restoration alternatives
``informal rulemaking'' or ``quasi-adjudicative'' under the APA? How would an administrative record prepared
by a state trustee be reviewed by a state court? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Should there be a means for preventing any one party from ``stuffing'' the administrative record to achieve a preponderance
of evidence or strain the ability of other parties to respond on the record? If so, what should it be? Should there be
designated times for the submission of materials to the record? Should the rule define the types of data, analysis
and other documents submitted to the record? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. How should the trustee comply with section 1006(c)(5) of OPA [restoration plans developed and implemented only
after adequate public notice, opportunity for hearing and comment] in the context of settlement? Specifically,
what type of process would satisfy the potential desire to settle an OPA claim with specific performance of a restoration
activity as well as comply with section 1006(c)(5) and NEPA? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The rule as currently proposed requires public review only when the trustee releases the Draft Assessment and Restoration
Plan. Should there be additional requirements for public review or participation? Should the requirements vary
according to the type of assessment chosen by the trustee?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Does NEPA apply to the trustee's selection of restoration alternatives? At what point is restoration planning
a ``major federal action'' or ``irretrievable commitment of resources'' for purposes of NEPA compliance? Is it appropriate
to postpone NEPA compliance until the trustee has received the money damages? Is it practical to combine NEPA compliance
with the development of the DARP? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If an administrative adjudication process conducted by an administrative law judge were set up for the review of
the administrative record and the trustee's demand for damages, would transaction costs be reduced from the present
system? Would the trustees be forced into a disadvantage by providing all of their data and basis for decisionmaking
on the record while the responsible party waited until the administrative trial to attack the record with expert witnesses
and extra-record evidence? Who would bear the costs of setting up and operating administrative adjudication system?
Would state or tribal trustees be required to use such a system?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Much attention has been given to valuing damages to natural resources. This attention has been directed, for the most
part, at the controversial economic valuation method of contingent valuation. However, given the expense and time
associated with designing and implementing site-specific studies, such as contingent valuation, natural resource
trustees have turned to alternative methods for the majority of oil spill damage assessments. Two alternative methods
have been included in the natural resource damage assessment regulations promulgated pursuant to the OPA: 1) the
benefits transfer method and 2) the habitat or species replacement cost method. These alternatives allow the trustee
to estimate compensable values or estimate damages for interim lost services at a lower cost than with site-specific
studies. A third alternative may also be considered that would involve government expenditures on a resource as a
lower bound for the ``value'' of that resource. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Benefits Transfer: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The benefits transfer method uses existing estimates of use values or of valuation functions that were developed
in one context to address a similar resource valuation question in a different context. Where resource values exist
that have been developed through an administrative or legislative process, or where other values are appropriate,
use of these values may allow a less time-consuming and less expensive damage estimation than original valuation
analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Habitat or Species Replacement Cost: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The habitat or species replacement cost method may be used to estimate damages for lost services from the injured habitats
and/or biological resources, when human services provided by the habitat or species are difficult to quantify. This
method involves estimating damages in terms of the cost of obtaining from alternative services the equivalent of
the resource and/or services. In order to ensure that the scale of the compensatory restoration or replacement project(s)
on which the cost calculation is based does not over- or under-compensate the public for injuries incurred, the proposed
OPA rule suggests that the trustee must establish an equivalency between the present discounted value (PDV) of the
quantity of lost services and the PDV of the quantity of services provided by the replacement project(s) over time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Contingent Valuation: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NOAA's proposed rule allows the use of contingent valuation (CV) to produce assessments of interim lost value, including
lost passive use value, based on its preliminary finding that such methodology is reliable enough for use in a judicial
or administrative determination of natural resource damages. To achieve the reliability necessary for this purpose,
however, NOAA has proposed a set of requirements to which the studies must adhere. This proposal was based on the guidance
provided by the report of the NOAA Blue Ribbon Panel on Contingent Valuation (chaired by Professors Kenneth Arrow
and Robert Solow) as well as other comments submitted to NOAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAA worked closely with The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) in drafting and refining the contingent valuation
(CV) language for the rule and in outlining the scope of a possible CV guidance document. DOI and NOAA agreed to propose
similar language for both the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and
Oil Pollution Act (OPA) rules, thereby providing consistent approaches to CV in the two regulatory schemes.

Comment Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the economic methods for computing compensable values generally took the form of question or dialogue.
There was some dialogue among members of the public and NOAA presenters concerning the appropriateness of including
contingent valuation as a method for estimating nonuse or ``passive'' values. One commenter queried whether trustees
could do inexpensive contingent valuation surveys for smaller spills. Another participant wondered how the trustees
would respond to a situation where a contingent valuation study used to measure total compensable value resulted
in damages less than necessary for restoration. Conversely, the commenter queried how the rule would guide the trustee
for whom a contingent valuation survey resulted in total compensable values of 100 million dollars when habitat replacement
would result in damages of 100 thousand dollars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Habitat replacement was the subject of significant interest as commenters inquired whether it was a compensable
values methodology or a restoration methodology. One commenter recommended NOAA provide a more clear explanation
of the habitat replacement method in the rule and distinguish between habitat replacement and acquisition of the
equivalent. In addition, it was suggested that NOAA clearly identify the possible double counting issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested better guidance be made available on the ``benefits transfer'' methodology. Of particular
concern was the situation where baseline studies failed to be reliable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, the question of whether trustees should apply ``offsets'' when calculating damages was a topic of extensive
discussion. Several commenters felt that in some circumstances a discharge of oil will cause an improvement in conditions
for some natural resources or increase the services of other natural resources. These commenters felt that the responsible
party should receive a positive offset against the injury to other natural resources or loss of their services. The
``offset'' concept was viewed by some commenters as particularly appropriate for direct uses vis a vis passive uses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Specific questions on which NOAA is seeking comment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. What should be the role, if any, of the requirements for site-specific CV studies measuring passive use value in
determining whether the quality of a CV study is adequate for use in benefits transfer? How would the extent of the market
be determined for benefits transfer using CV studies? Should the conditions be different for valuing direct use losses
and for valuing passive use losses? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Government expenditures (per unit of services injured) have been suggested as a proxy for the value of those services
lost as a result of an incident. Should the OPA rule suggest that government expenditures may be used as a proxy for the
value of a resource? Under what circumstances would use of this method be appropriate? For example, should the trustee
be directed to consider whether the following two conditions be met in determining appropriateness of the method:
changes in the quality/quantity of the injured resources can be related to the (change in) level of government expenditures;
the government programs for which expenditures have been accounted are the major cause of the changes in the quality/quantity
of the affected resource? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed OPA rule specifies that the trustee is to use the U.S. Treasury rate to discount for all three categories
of damages: restoration costs, interim lost value, and damage assessment costs. Following the guidance in OMB Circular
A&hyph;94 (for cost-effectiveness analysis and for federal leasing), nominal interest rates are to be used with
damages in nominal terms (for example, past costs) and real rates (with an adjustment based on the Administration's
prediction for future inflation published in the President's budget) are to be used for damages in real terms. ``Nominal
terms'' refers to calculations expressed in the dollars of the year in which the damages accrued; ``real terms'' refers
to damages expressed in dollars of a base year (such as the year in which the claim is presented). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For restoration costs, what if the return on accounts available to the trustee(s) for placement of recovered funds
is lower than the U.S. Treasury rate, so that the present discounted value of future restoration costs will not support
the full restoration project? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The proposed OPA rule provides that the trustee must document the method used to calibrate hypothetical willingness
to pay to actual willingness to pay. In the absence of such documentation, the trustee must divide by two. This calibration
procedure is to ``correct'' for the combined effects of two countervailing potential biases: the mandated elicitation
of willingness to pay (WTP) measures may understate the correct measure of damages [willingness to accept], whereas
the elicitation of hypothetical WTP in contingent valuation studies may overstate ``true'' WTP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Is calibration appropriate? If so, is the proposed default calibration factor appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. On what basis could ``calibration'' factors be developed for individual cases? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. If reliable calibration of hypothetical to actual WTP is not feasible, would it be reasonable to rely on unadjusted
WTP results of CV studies as a valid measure of nonuse values/use values? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The proposed OPA rule states that two independent ``scope'' tests are to be conducted, showing significant changes
in respondents' WTP in response to variations in the scope of injuries (from the injury scenario to be proved in the
case), unless the trustee(s) can show creation of two alternate scenarios to the base case is infeasible due to considerations
of cost or lack of plausibility of scenarios. The tests are to be conducted with an additional sample for each additional
scenario, (a ``split sample'' test). Procedures are outlined for limiting the differences in scope between the base
case and alternative scenarios.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. How many sensitivity to ``scope of injury'' tests are appropriate to require? Are restrictions on differences
between scenarios appropriate or feasible? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Is it appropriate to allow the trustee(s) to conduct the scope test with the base survey instrument, by constructing
a valuation function to examine whether variations in belief about injuries predict variations in WTP, controlling
for demographic and attitudinal factors? Are there additional/alternative internal validity test(s) that NOAA
should consider? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 70% is the minimum allowable response rate contained in the proposed OPA rule. In order to minimize non-response
bias, should a minimum response rate be specified? If so, is 70% the appropriate level? If 70% is not the appropriate
rate, what rationale is there for a different rate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In the proposed OPA rule, the trustee(s) is directed to use a choice mechanism that is credible and incentive-compatible,
i.e., one that does not provide respondents with incentives to understate or overstate their true value. The reasons
are outlined in the preamble for recommending the use of a referendum as the choice mechanism in a survey. Are these
requirements appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Should respondents with no knowledge of the resources and/or injuries prior to survey be assigned a zero value?
What is the appropriate use of data on respondents' prior information? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Should there be thresholds for damages, below which CV could not be used in a damage assessment, e.g., an expected
$5/household times the number of households expected to hold passive values; and/or twice the cost of a contingent
valuation survey following these regulations. What threshold, if any, is appropriate? How would the threshold be
implemented (without performing a CV study? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In the proposed rule, the trustee(s) has the option of choosing the mode of administration of a survey, but the choice
must be justified. Is one mode, e.g., in-person, telephone, or mail, preferable to another? If so, or if not, what rationale
supports it? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Should the rule or preamble provide guidance as to criteria to be employed in determining the extent of the market?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. What requirements, if any, should be imposed on CV studies for valuing direct use only? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. What requirements, if any, should be imposed on contingent behavior studies?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of the Treasury (``Department'') is publishing for comment proposed amendments to the financial
responsibility rules in Part 402 and a conforming amendment to a recordkeeping requirement in Part 404 of the regulations
issued under the Government Securities Act of 1986 (``GSA''). The proposed amendments would raise the minimum capital
requirements for all government securities brokers and dealers subject to the requirements of Section 402.2 and
establish a written notification requirement for certain withdrawals of capital. The proposed amendments parallel
the Securities and Exchange Commission's (``SEC'') final and proposed amendments to the minimum net capital requirements
for brokers and dealers subject to the requirements of 17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1 (Rule 15c3&hyph;1) and final rules
regarding the withdrawal of capital.

1. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is proposing amendments to its financial responsibility rules in Part 402 that would raise the minimum
capital requirements and establish written notification requirements for certain capital withdrawals for those
government securities brokers and dealers subject to the provisions of &sect;402.2. Additionally, the Department
is proposing a conforming change to the recordkeeping requirements of Part 404 which is necessitated by the proposals
to revise the minimum capital levels. The Department believes that these proposed amendments will enhance the capital
adequacy of government securities brokers and dealers and provide for more effective regulatory oversight. These
proposed amendments parallel rule amendments adopted or proposed by the SEC. The Department's amendments, if adopted,
will increase investor confidence in the financial responsibility of government securities brokers and dealers
without creating any substantial new barriers to entry into the government securities market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SEC published proposed revisions to its minimum capital levels in October 1989
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and December 1992
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and to its capital withdrawal rules in August 1990.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The SEC published its final capital withdrawal regulations on March 5, 1991,
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 finalized its first change in minimum capital levels on November 24, 1992,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 but has not yet finalized its second proposal on minimum capital levels for certain introducing firms. The Treasury
capital rule
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 uses the SEC capital standard (Rule 15c3&hyph;1)
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 as a foundation and, accordingly, it is useful to strive to minimize the differences between the two rules. Additionally,
it is Treasury's objective to maintain consistency with the SEC rule and, ultimately, have a uniform capital rule
for all government securities brokers and dealers registered with the SEC. The Treasury would have acted sooner to
propose these amendments but its rulemaking authority under the GSA expired on October 1, 1991, and was not reauthorized
until December 17, 1993. (107 Stat. 2344, Pub. L. 103&hyph;202).

Having reviewed the SEC's actions, the Department has determined to propose changes to its capital rule, which, for
the most part, parallel the SEC's modifications. The following text explains the Department's rationale supporting
its amendments, with particular emphasis on the differences between the Department's and the SEC's changes.

A. Minimum Capital Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SEC has either increased or proposed increasing the minimum net capital requirements for most brokers and dealers
subject to Rule 15c3&hyph;1 to an amount ranging up to $250,000, depending on the type of business conducted by the
broker or dealer. The previous minimum requirements had been unchanged for at least 16 years, and, in the case of the
$5,000 level applicable to introducing brokers, for 26 years.

The Department, in developing its existing capital rule, modified the SEC minimum capital levels prior to incorporating
them into the Treasury rule. The modifications reflected the different structure of the Treasury capital requirement
whereby securities haircuts are not deducted but instead act as a benchmark with which liquid capital is compared
in determining capital adequacy. Nonetheless, the minimum dollar capital levels are based on liquid capital after
deducting haircuts, which is comparable to the SEC's calculation of net capital. The Treasury rule currently has
a $5,000 minimum liquid capital requirement for introducing brokers
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 and a $25,000 minimum liquid capital requirement for all other government securities brokers and dealers
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 subject to the rule.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 These levels are equivalent to SEC requirements applicable to brokers and dealers operating under the aggregate
indebtedness capital computation prior to the amendments. The Department believes that increasing the minimum
levels is appropriate in order to provide better protection to investors in the event of a government securities broker's
or dealer's insolvency and to reflect the current realities of the government securities market. Accordingly, the
Department is proposing to increase the minimum capital requirements for all government securities brokers and
dealers subject to the provisions of &sect;402.2. The other capital requirement_that liquid capital be at least
equal to 120% of haircuts_would be unaffected by this proposal.

The Treasury capital rule requires that a government securities broker or dealer maintain a capital level of the greater
of (i) 120% of total haircuts; or (ii) the minimum dollar capital amounts, computed by deducting total haircuts from
liquid capital, applicable to its business.

The increases would be effected by creating four minimum capital standards from the two current requirements, reflecting
a better differentiation of the risks related to a government securities broker's or dealer's operations based on
the type of government securities business it conducts. The four proposed minimum capital requirements would be
as follows: (1) government securities brokers and dealers that carry customer or broker-dealer accounts would be
subject to a minimum level of $250,000; (2) government securities brokers and dealers that carry customer accounts
but that operate under the exemption provided by Rule 15c3&hyph;3(k)(2)(i)
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 would have a minimum requirement of $100,000; (3) government securities brokers that introduce accounts on a fully
disclosed basis and receive but do not hold customer securities would be subject to a minimum requirement of $50,000;
and (4) introducing firms that never handle customer funds or securities would be subject to a minimum requirement
of $25,000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These changes represent increases from the current minimum levels of between $20,000 and $225,000, depending on
the type of business conducted by the government securities broker or dealer. The Department is proposing fewer levels
than the SEC has proposed since the operations of government securities brokers and dealers do not encompass all the
activities available to diversified brokers or dealers. The proposed Treasury minimum capital requirements adequately
reflect the different levels of custodial risk found in the various types of government securities operations without
creating significant barriers to entry into the government securities market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any increase of capital requirements represents a potential burden on regulated entities and on the market; this
potential effect must be weighed against the resulting benefits. Minimum capital levels provide a cushion which
is available to ease the liquidation or resolution of troubled government securities brokers and dealers. This is
a fundamental element of customer protection. The increases that the Department is proposing are modest relative
to the size and complexity of the government securities market and the operations of government securities brokers
and dealers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the SEC first proposed increasing broker's and dealer's minimum capital levels, the SEC received comments opposing
the increased requirements. The SEC has also received additional negative comments from introducing firms that
would be affected by the outstanding proposal to increase the minimum net capital level of such brokers. However,
the Department believes that its proposed increases will have a very small impact on the firms, including introducing
brokers, subject to &sect;402.2. An analysis of the government securities brokers and dealers subject to the provisions
of &sect;402.2 indicates that, as of June 30, 1993, only seven, out of a total of 39, would not be in compliance with the
proposed, fully phased-in minimum capital levels. Four of these firms would not be in compliance with the new requirements
for introducing firms, two would be out of compliance with the $100,000 requirement and one would not meet the $250,000
level. The aggregate capital shortfall of these seven firms is less than $200,000, with the largest individual deficit
being less than $50,000. To ease the compliance burden and to provide a period for the affected government securities
brokers and dealers to adjust, the Department is proposing to add an Appendix E to &sect;402.2 which would phase in
the increases over an 18-month time frame from the effective date. This corresponds to the phase in time frames that
were adopted and proposed by the SEC.

14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These rules require written notification to the SEC and the broker's or dealer's designated examining authority
of certain capital withdrawals; add a restriction on the withdrawal of capital based on the ratio of net capital to
securities haircuts; provide additional definitions; and permit the SEC, by order, to prohibit the withdrawal of
capital in certain described circumstances. The Department is proposing to amend its capital withdrawal provisions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The notification provisions would require post-withdrawal notification of certain significant capital withdrawals
as well as prior notification for larger withdrawals. Whether the notification would be required prior to the withdrawal
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 would be determined by the aggregate size of total withdrawals relative to the government securities broker's or
dealer's excess liquid capital
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 over a 30 calendar day period. Once aggregate withdrawals have exceeded 20 percent of a government securities broker's
or dealer's excess liquid capital in a 30 calendar day period, the government securities broker or dealer will have
two business days thereafter in which to file notification of the withdrawals. Aggregate withdrawals in excess of
30 percent of excess liquid capital in any 30 calendar day period would require notification two business days prior
to such withdrawal. A government securities broker or dealer may use the level of excess liquid capital calculated
in its most recent Form G&hyph;405, ``Report on Finances and Operations of Government Securities Brokers and Dealers
(FOGS)'' filing,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provided the firm assures itself that this amount has not materially changed since that time. A government securities
broker or dealer is not required under the proposed rule to provide notice to the Department, but instead notice would
be sent to the SEC and to the broker's or dealer's designated examining authority.

The proposed rule would exclude the reporting of net withdrawals that, in the aggregate, are less than $500,000 in
any 30 calendar day period or those that represent securities or commodities transactions between affiliates. The
exclusion for securities and commodities transactions requires that the transactions be conducted in the ordinary
course of business and settled no later than two business days after the date of the transaction. Discussions with
SEC staff have indicated that forward settling transactions between affiliates would not be eligible for this exclusion.

Therefore, net losses on forward contracts or net payments on swap agreements, if due an affiliate, could trigger
the notice requirement. The Department specifically requests comment as to whether this exclusion should be broadened
and if so how. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only material difference between the notification rules as promulgated by the SEC and as proposed by the Department
is that the SEC's rules use excess net capital, whereas the Department's rule uses excess liquid capital. This variance
conforms to the different measurement standards used under each rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that knowledge of significant capital movements is an essential part of ensuring capital
adequacy and financial responsibility. The SEC's experience with the Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, Inc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the National Association of Securities Dealer's experience with Drexel Burnham Lambert GSI making substantial
amounts of inadequately secured loans to its holding company indicate the importance of prompt and accurate knowledge
of the movement of capital.

The Department does not plan to amend the current restrictions on the withdrawal of capital to reflect the SEC's adoption
of a new early warning threshold derived from securities haircuts. It has been the Department's belief, in establishing
its capital standard, that a capital cushion related to a firm's securities position risk is a prudent approach to
determining capital adequacy. The Treasury rule currently places a restriction on any capital withdrawals that
would cause a government securities broker's or dealer's liquid capital to fall below a level of 150% of haircuts.
This standard is analogous to the recently-adopted SEC requirement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

The third element of the SEC's capital withdrawal rule is a provision giving the SEC authority to prohibit a withdrawal
of capital by a broker or dealer, for up to 20 business days, if the withdrawal would exceed 30% of excess net capital
and is deemed detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker or dealer or may unduly jeopardize the broker's
or dealer's ability to repay its creditors.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 The SEC intends that this provision be used in emergency situations and the rule provides for an expeditious review
of the SEC's action. For the reasons that follow, the Department has determined that a similar provision should not
be incorporated in the Treasury capital rule.

First, while the SEC has an existing process for holding hearings, the Department has no comparable structure and
therefore the implementation of the post-order process would require the Department to develop additional administrative
regulations and procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department's decision not to enact a corresponding order provision is based on the fact that the SEC
has existing temporary cease and desist authority. The SEC was granted this authority prusuant to the Securities
Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;429), Section 203 of which added Section
21C to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Paragraph (c) of Section 21C provides the SEC with authority to issue a temporary cease and desist order in the event
``that the alleged violation or threatened violation specified in the notice *&blank;*&blank;* is likely to result
in significant dissipation or conversion of assets, significant harm to investors, or substantial harm to the public
interest,*&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
23
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A temporary cease and desist order, while different from a capital withdrawal order, serves a similar purpose. Both
are emergency remedies that can be expeditiously applied. Prior to issuing a temporary cease and desist order, the
SEC must provide notice and opportunity for a hearing unless the SEC ``*&blank;*&blank;* determines that notice
and hearing prior to entry would be impracticable or contrary to the public interest.''

The more limited scope of the temporary cease and desist order is not problematic to the Department because the authority
provides the SEC with the ability to issue such an order not only if a rule violation has occurred but also if one is threatened.
Since the SEC is the appropriate regulatory agency for government securities brokers or dealers subject to &sect;402.2,
an impending violation of a &sect;402.2 requirement would be cause for the issuance of a temporary cease and desist
order. The SEC would still be able to anticipate sizeable capital withdrawals that might result in violations of &sect;402.2,
since it would receive the notifications required by the proposed rule, as described earlier. The SEC would only be
prevented from issuing a temporary cease and desist order in the circumstance where a government securities broker
or dealer would remain in capital compliance and would not breach the rule's early warning levels as a result of the
withdrawal. Assuming the adequacy of the current capital standards and withdrawal restrictions, it is difficult
to foresee a circumstance in which issuance of a capital withdrawal order would be desirable when a government securities
broker or dealer would continue to remain in capital compliance. For these reasons, the Department believes that,
in lieu of developing a separate capital withdrawal order provision, it should rely on the SEC's existing cease and
desist order authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with this approach, the Department also is excluding this provision of Rule 15c3&hyph;1 from the compliance
requirements for those government securities brokers and dealers registered under Section 15C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o&hyph;5) that are subject to the SEC capital rule (i.e., interdealer brokers operating
under &sect;402.1(e) and futures commission merchants). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In amending the withdrawal provisions, the Department has restructured certain related definitions of terms into
a Miscellaneous Provisions paragraph (i)(3) and has added a description of what constitutes an advance or loan of
liquid capital, which is one component of the restricted activities.

Due to the revisions of the minimum capital requirements under both the SEC and Treasury capital rules, a conforming
change is required in the recordkeeping provisions of Part 404. Specifically, paragraph 404.2(a)(4) contains references
to the minimum dollar capital amounts required of government securities clearing brokers and dealers. The Department
is proposing to revise these references in accordance with the proposed fully phased-in minimum capital level of
$250,000 required of clearing firms.

III. Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the very limited impact of the proposed amendments, it is the Department's view that the proposed regulations
are not a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes of Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), it is hereby certified that the proposed regulations, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. As of June 30, 1993, only 39 government securities brokers and dealers were
subject to the capital requirements of &sect;402.2. Of these, only 11 firms would be considered small entities. Accordingly,
the relatively low dollar value of the proposed capital increase and the small number of firms affected indicates
that there is not a significant impact. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) requires that collections of information prescribed in proposed
rules be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval. In accordance with this requirement,
the Department has submitted the collection of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking for review.
Comments on the collection of information should be directed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,
Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for Department of the Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20503;
and to the Government Securities Regulations Staff, Bureau of the Public Debt, at the address specified at the beginning
of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collections of information in this proposed rule are contained in proposed &sect;402.2(i)(1). This paragraph
would require a government securities broker or dealer, subject to the requirements of &sect;402.2, to provide written
notification of certain specified withdrawals of capital. This collection of information is intended to allow the
SEC and the designated examining authority of the firm to better monitor the government securities broker's or dealer's
operations and financial condition. The rule applies primarily to larger government securities brokers and dealers
since aggregate withdrawals of less than $500,000 are excluded from the requirement.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes amendments to regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to constructive distributions on preferred stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations concern the treatment of stock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redeemable at a premium by the issuer. Under the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, a call premium is generally treated as giving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rise to a constructive distribution only if redemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the call provision is more likely than not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur. The proposed amendments to the regulations also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect 1990 amendments to section 305(c) of the Internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue Code.

Management and Budget for review in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the collection of information should be sent to the Office

of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection of information is in &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(5). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is required to notify the IRS that the issuer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and holder of stock subject to section 305 have made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent determinations as to whether there is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constructive distribution under &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b). The likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondents are individuals or households and business or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other for-profit institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated total annual reporting burden: 333 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated annual burden per respondent varies from 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minutes to 15 minutes, depending on individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, with an estimated average of 10 minutes. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated number of respondents: 2000. Estimated annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency of responses: one.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes amendments to the Income Tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 305 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section 305(a) provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gross income generally does not include stock dividends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 305(b)(4) provides an exception for certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributions with respect to preferred stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 305(c) provides that, under regulations, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between redemption price and issue price, or any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction having a similar effect, shall be treated as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution. This provision addresses methods ``devised to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give preferred stockholders the equivalent of dividends on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred stock which are not taxable as such under present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law.'' S. Rep. No. 552, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 151 (1969). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, ``a corporation may issue preferred stock for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$100 per share which pays no dividends, but which may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redeemed in 20 years for $200. The effect is the same as if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the corporation distributed preferred stock equal to 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the original stock each year during the 20-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period in lieu of cash dividends.'' Id. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(1) provides that if a corporation issues preferred stock which may be redeemed after
a specified period of time at a price higher than the issue price, the difference is considered a distribution of additional
stock on preferred stock which is constructively received by the shareholder over the period of time during which
the preferred stock cannot be called for redemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(2) provides that this rule does not apply to the extent that the higher redemption
price represents a reasonable redemption premium. A safe harbor is provided under which a redemption premium is considered
reasonable if it is not in excess of 10 percent of the issue price on stock not redeemable for five years from the date
of issuance. A redemption premium that does not meet this safe harbor is considered reasonable if it is in the nature
of a penalty for premature redemption and is not larger than the premiums being paid for this purpose by other issuers
of similar stock at the time of issuance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(1) can apply to preferred stock that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is redeemable solely at the option of the issuer. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holder generally must treat a call premium as a constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution under &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b) to the extent that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premium is unreasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 305(c) was amended by the Revenue Reconciliation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1990 (the 1990 Act), Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, which changed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the treatment of stock redeemable at a premium. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments provide that: (a) If the issuer is required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redeem stock at a specified time, or the holder has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option to require the issuer to redeem stock, at a premium, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the redemption premium will result in a constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution if it exceeds a de minimis amount computed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the principles of section 1273(a)(3); (b) a redemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premium will not fail to be treated as a distribution (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
series of distributions) merely because the stock is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
callable; and (c) in any case where a redemption premium is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as a distribution (or series of distributions), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premium will be taken into account under principles similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to those of section 1272(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to section 305(c) did not alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that constructive distributions resulting from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption premium be treated as distributions to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 301 applies only if they have the effect described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 305(b), including section 305(b)(4). Rather, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments were adopted because Congress believed that ``the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic accrual rules applicable to debt instruments issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with [original issue discount (OID)] also should generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to certain preferred stock issued with a redemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premium if the stock will be redeemed, or if it can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably be assumed that the stock will be redeemed, on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fixed date.'' H.R. Rep. No. 881, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 347 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1990). The legislative history to the 1990 amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that Congress did not intend to limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority of the Treasury and the IRS to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper treatment of redemption premiums on callable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred stock. Id. at 348&hyph;49.

1990 Act Amendments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5 (b)(1) and (b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restate the basic rules concerning the treatment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatorily redeemable and puttable stock in conformity with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1990 Act. The IRS and Treasury anticipate that other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues raised by the 1990 Act will be addressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Treatment of issuer call rights
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The primary focus of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations is on the treatment under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
305(c) of stock callable at a premium at the option of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If stock is subject to an issuer call, the holder cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control whether the stock will be redeemed at the premium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount. Moreover, if the payment of a call premium merely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects increases in the value of the holder's stock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from market fluctuations after the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuance, the call premium is not the equivalent of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution and its payment is more appropriately taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only upon realization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, on the date of issuance, however, it is more likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than not that an issuer will exercise its call option based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the economic terms of the stock, the holder's anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in the earnings and assets of the issuer through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the call premium is equivalent to a periodic return on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stock that should be taxed over time as a distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a call has the effect of a mandatory redemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision, and should produce comparable tax consequences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(3) requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constructive distribution treatment with respect to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuer call only if, based on all of the facts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances as of the issue date, redemption pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the call right is more likely than not to occur. Even if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption may be likely, however, constructive distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment does not result if the redemption premium is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely in the nature of a penalty for premature redemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A penalty for premature redemption is a premium paid as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of changes in economic or market conditions over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which neither the issuer nor the holder has control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples include changes in prevailing dividend rates or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the value of the common stock into which the stock is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convertible. Calls in such cases reflect increases in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of the holder's stock resulting from events that occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the date of issuance, and the premiums paid thereon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore represent a penalty for premature redemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than the equivalent of a periodic return on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under a safe harbor, constructive distribution treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not result from an issuer call if the issuer and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holder are unrelated, there are no arrangements that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively require the issuer to redeem the stock, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercise of the option to redeem would not reduce the yield 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard in the proposed safe harbor is similar to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standard for taking into account call options in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the yield of debt instruments potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the accrual of OID. See &sect;1.1272&hyph;1(c)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the determination of whether a redemption premium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be treated as a constructive distribution is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based solely on the effect of an issuer call on yield. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(1) does not provide any exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from constructive distribution treatment for stock that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately callable by the issuer. Under proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(3), a constructive distribution by
reason of the issuer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
call would only occur in cases where a call is more likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than not to occur, based on the facts and circumstances as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the issue date. The holder is treated as constructively

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed regulations, the tax consequences of callable preferred stock are intended to reflect the economic
expectations of the parties and to afford issuers flexibility to issue stock on terms that reflect their business
needs. The proposed regulations are also intended to foreclose corporations from attempting to use issuer calls
to create constructive distributions solely for tax planning reasons. However, no inference is to be drawn from the
proposed regulations as to the appropriate treatment of such call rights under current law. Such provisions are subject
to scrutiny under general tax principles (e.g., substance over form).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
De minimis exception. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(1) would replace the ``reasonable redemption premium'' exception under current
&sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(2) with the statutory de minimis rule under section 305(c)(1) for mandatorily redeemable
and puttable stock, and extend the statutory rule to issuer calls. Extending this rule to issuer calls differs from
the treatment discussed in the legislative history of the 1990 Act, but is appropriate because the proposed regulations
limit constructive distribution treatment with respect to issuer calls to circumstances in which the stock is economically
similar to mandatorily redeemable stock. In those cases, the call premium cannot fairly be said to be ``in the nature
of a penalty for premature redemption.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since those cases are outside of the intended scope of the exception in the current regulations, there is no reason
to retain current &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(2) for callable stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conforming changes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would conform the examples in &sect;&sect;1.305&hyph;3 and 1.305&hyph;5 to the proposed
changes described above. In addition, the proposed regulations would conform language in &sect;1.305&hyph;7(a)
to the proposed changes described above.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effective dates. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(6) contains the effective date rules. In general, the regulations are proposed
to apply to stock issued on or after the date final regulations are filed with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee reports to the 1990 Act indicate that Congress did not intend to limit the authority of the Secretary
to promulgate regulations relating to the accrual of redemption premiums on callable preferred stock. However,
the reports indicate that Congress anticipated any such regulations would be prospective. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964,
101st Cong., 2d Sess. 1095 (1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the proposed regulations do not apply to stock issued before the date final regulations are filed with the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the rules of sections 305(c) (1), (2), and (3) apply to stock described therein issued on or after October 10, 1990,
except as provided in section 11322(b)(2) of the 1990 Act. The committee reports to the 1990 Act express Congress'
intention that the economic accrual and OID de minimis rules generally apply as of the effective date of the 1990 Act
without regard to when regulations are amended to reflect such rules. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess.
1095 (1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee reports note that, in general, the OID de minimis rule will not apply to preferred stock that is callable
solely at the option of the issuer (unless such stock is subject to a mandatory redemption or is puttable). However,
the economic accrual rule will apply as of the effective date of the 1990 Act to the entire call premium on stock that
is callable solely at the option of the issuer (but not mandatorily redeemable or puttable) if such premium is considered
to be unreasonable under the current regulations. In such cases, except as provided in regulations, the entire call
premium will be accrued over the period of time during which the preferred stock cannot be called for redemption. It
should be noted that the committee reports also authorize the Secretary to treat stock that, in form, is merely callable
as being subject to a mandatory redemption or a put if the existence of other arrangements effectively requires the
issuer to redeem the stock. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 1095 (1990).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IRS and Treasury invite public comment on the proposed regulations and on any issues involving the implementation

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

Comments and Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public
inspection and copying. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public hearing has been scheduled for November 14, 1994, at 10 a.m., in the auditorium. Because of access restrictions,
visitors will not be admitted beyond the Internal Revenue Building lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons that wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit written comments by October 24, 1994, and submit
an outline of the topics (signed original and eight (8) copies) to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic
by October 24, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for making comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed.
Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing.

Facts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Corporation V is organized with two classes of stock, class A common and class B convertible preferred. The class B
stock is issued for $100 per share and is convertible into class A at a fixed ratio that is not subject to full adjustment
in the event stock dividends or rights are distributed to the class A shareholders. The class B stock pays no dividends
but it is mandatorily redeemable in 10 years for $200. Under sections 305(c) and 305(b)(4), the entire redemption
premium (i.e., the excess of the redemption price over the issue price) is deemed to be a distribution of preferred
stock on preferred stock which is taxable as a distribution of property under section 301. This amount is considered
to be distributed over the 10-year period under principles similar to the principles of section 1272(a). During the
year, the corporation declares a dividend on the class A stock payable in additional shares of class A stock. (ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Analysis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The distribution on the class A stock is a distribution to which sections 305(b)(2) and 301 apply since it increases
the proportionate interests of the class A shareholders in the assets and earnings and profits of the corporation
and the class B shareholders have received property (i.e., the constructive distribution described above). If,
however, the conversion ratio of the class B stock were subject to full adjustment to reflect the distribution of stock
to class A shareholders, the distribution of stock dividends on the class A stock would not increase the proportionate
interest of the class A shareholders in the assets and earnings and profits of the corporation and such distribution
would not be a distribution to which section 301 applies.

In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a corporation issues preferred stock that may be redeemed under the circumstances described in this paragraph
(b) at a price higher than the issue price, the difference (the redemption premium) is treated under section 305(c)
as a constructive distribution (or series of constructive distributions) of additional stock on preferred stock
that is taken into account under principles similar to the principles of section 1272(a). However, constructive
distribution treatment does not result under this paragraph if the redemption premium does not exceed a de minimis
amount, as determined under the principles of section 1273(a)(3).

In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b)(1) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section applies to stock by reason of the issuer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to redeem the stock (even if the right is immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercisable), but only if, based on all of the facts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances as of the issue date, redemption pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that right is more likely than not to occur. However, even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if redemption is more likely than not to occur, paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) of this section does not apply if the redemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premium is solely in the nature of a penalty for premature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption. A penalty for premature redemption is a premium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid as a result of changes in economic or market conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over which neither the issuer nor the holder has control.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption pursuant to an issuer's right is not treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more likely than not to occur if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The issuer and the holder are not related within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) There are no arrangements that effectively require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the issuer to redeem the stock; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Exercise of the right to redeem would not reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yield of the stock, as determined under principles similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the principles of section 1272(a).

The fact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a redemption right is not described in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(3)(ii) of this section does not affect the determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Coordination of multiple redemption provisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions of stock permit redemption at more than one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, the time and price at which redemption is most likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to occur must be determined based on all of the facts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances as of the issue date. Any constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution under paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construed to result only with respect to the time and price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in the preceding sentence. However, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption does not occur at that identified time, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of any additional premium payable on any later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption date, to the extent not previously treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributed, is treated as a constructive distribution over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period from the missed call or put date to that later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date, to the extent required under the principles of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b).

Consistency. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issuer's determination as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether there is a constructive distribution under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) is binding on all holders of the stock, other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than a holder that explicitly discloses that its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination as to whether there is a constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution under this paragraph (b) differs from that of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the issuer. Unless otherwise prescribed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commissioner, the disclosure must be made on a statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attached to the holder's timely filed Federal income tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return for the taxable year that includes the date the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holder acquired the stock. The issuer must provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant information to the holder in a reasonable manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the issuer may provide the name or title and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the address or telephone number of a representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the issuer who will make available to holders upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Facts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Corporation X is a domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporation with only common stock outstanding. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection with its acquisition of Corporation T, X issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 shares of its 4% preferred stock to the shareholders of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
T, who are unrelated to X. The issue price of the preferred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stock is $40 per share. Each share of preferred stock is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convertible at the shareholder's election into three shares 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of X common stock. At the time the preferred stock is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued, the X common stock has a value of $10 per share. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preferred stock does not provide for its mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption or for redemption at the option of the holder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is callable at the option of X at any time beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three years from the date of issuance for $100 per share. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no other arrangements that would affect X's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision to call the preferred stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Analysis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The preferred stock is described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe harbor rule of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because X and the former shareholders of T are unrelated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are no arrangements that effectively require X to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redeem the stock, and calling the stock for $100 per share 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not reduce the yield of the preferred stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the $60 per share call premium is not treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a constructive distribution to the shareholders of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred stock under paragraph (b) of this section.

Facts_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Corporation Y is a domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporation with only common stock outstanding. On 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1995, Y issues 100 shares of its 10% preferred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stock to an unrelated holder. The issue price of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred stock is $100 per share. The preferred stock is_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) Callable at the option of Y on or before January 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2000, at a price of $105 per share plus any accrued but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unpaid dividends; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) Mandatorily redeemable on January 1, 2005, at a price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of $100 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The preferred stock provides that if Y fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercise its option to call the preferred stock on or before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 2000, the holder will be entitled to appoint a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of Y's directors. It is reasonably anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Y will have available funds sufficient to exercise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to redeem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Analysis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies because, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by virtue of the change of control provision and the absence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of any contrary facts, it is more likely than not that Y 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will exercise its option to call the preferred stock on or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before January 1, 2000. The safe harbor rule of paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(3)(ii) of this section does not apply because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision that failure to call will cause the holder to gain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of the corporation is an arrangement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively requires Y to redeem the preferred stock. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution occurs over the period ending on January 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2000. Redemption is most likely to occur on that date, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because that is the date on which the corporation minimizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rate of return to the holder but yet prevents the holder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from gaining control. The de minimis exception of paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) of this section does not apply because the $5 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
share difference between the redemption price and the issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price exceeds the amount determined under the principles of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1273(a)(3) (5 &times; .0025 &times; $105 = $1.31). Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$5 per share, the difference between the redemption price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the issue price, is treated as a constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution received by the holder on an economic accrual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis over the five year period ending on January 1, 2000, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under principles similar to the principles of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1272(a).

(A) Corporation Z is a domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corporation with only common stock outstanding. On 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1995, Z issues 100 shares of its 10% preferred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stock to C, an unrelated individual. The issue price of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) There are no other arrangements between Z and C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning redemption of the stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Analysis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(4) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because, absent any other facts indicating a contrary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result, the fact that redemption on January 1, 2000, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the yield of the stock and produce the lowest yield 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that exercise of the option to call on that date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is more likely than not to occur. The safe harbor rule of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section does not apply to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option to call on January 1, 2000, because the call would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the yield of the stock. The de minimis exception of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$10 per share difference between the redemption price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payable in 2000 and the issue price exceeds the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined under the principles of section 1273(a)(3) (5 &times; .0025 &times; $110 = $1.38). Accordingly, $10 per
share, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between the redemption price and the issue price, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is treated as a constructive distribution received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holder on an economic accrual basis over the five year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period ending January 1, 2000, under principles similar to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the principles of section 1272(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Coordination rules_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) If Z does not exercise its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option to call the preferred stock on January 1, 2000, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(4) of this section provides that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles of paragraph (b) of this section must be applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine if any remaining constructive distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs. Under paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(4) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies because, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absent any other facts indicating a contrary result, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact that redemption on July 1, 2001, would produce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lowest yield indicates that exercise of the option to call 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on that date is more likely than not to occur. The safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harbor rule of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to the option to call on July 1, 2001, because, as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first call date, a call by Z on July 1, 2001, for $120 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would reduce the yield of the stock. The de minimis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception of paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the $10 per share difference between the redemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price and the issue price (revised as of the missed call 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date) exceeds the amount determined under the principles of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1273(a)(3) (1 &times; .0025 &times; $120 = $.30). Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the $10 per share of additional redemption premium that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payable on July 1, 2001, is treated as a constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution received by the holder on an economic accrual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis over the period between January 1, 2000, and July 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2001, under principles similar to the principles of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1272(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If Z does not exercise its second option to call the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred stock on July 1, 2001, then the $30 additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redemption premium that is payable on January 1, 2003, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as a constructive distribution under paragraphs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(2) and (b)(1) of this section. The de minimis exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the $30 per share difference between the redemption price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the issue price (revised as of the second missed call 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date) exceeds the amount determined under the principles of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1273(a)(3) (1 &times; .0025 &times; $150 = $.38). The holder is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated as receiving the constructive distribution on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic accrual basis over the period between July 1, 2001, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and January 1, 2003, under principles similar to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles of section 1272(a).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 29, 1992, the EPA promulgated final regulations implementing the Early Reductions Program under section
112(i)(5) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA). As part of that rulemaking, EPA designated a list of high risk hazardous
air pollutants and limited the use of offsetting reductions in other hazardous air pollutants as counting towards
the required reductions in high-risk pollutants. The proposed standards would delete acrylic acid (CAS No. 79107)
from the list of high-risk pollutants. This action would be in accordance with the terms of a settlement agreement
reached in the following case: Basic Acrylic Monomer Manufacturers v EPA, No. 93&hyph;1179 (D.C. Cir.).

1. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 29, 1992, the EPA promulgated final regulations implementing the Early Reductions Program under section
112(i)(5) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7412 (i)(5), 57 FR 61970 (December 29, 1992). As part of that
rulemaking, EPA designated a list of 47 high risk hazardous air pollutants and limited the use of offsetting reductions
in other hazardous air pollutants as counting towards the required reductions in high-risk pollutants by assigning
these pollutants various weighting factors. Acrylic acid (CAS No. 79107) was designated as a high-risk pollutant
and was assigned a weighting factor of 10.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The methodology for selecting the high-risk pollutants is documented in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices for the proposed Early Reduction Program rule (56 FR 27338) and the final regulations (as cited above). Additional
detailed information on the selection criteria is also available in the Early Reduction Program docket (Docket No.
A&hyph;90&hyph;47). In general, certain criteria were established to screen hazardous air pollutants for their
potential for high risk of adverse public health effects associated with exposure to small quantities of emissions.
The screening analysis considered health effects and potential exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on EPA's analysis of data available in 1992, acrylic acid was included on the list of high-risk pollutants based
in part on the inhalation reference concentration (RfC) for acrylic acid in EPA's Integrated Risk Information System
(IRIS). A reference concentration is an estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude or more)
of the daily exposure to the human population (including sensitive subpopulations) that is likely to be without deleterious
effects during a lifetime. On February 26, 1993, Basic Acrylic Monomer Manufacturers (BAMM) filed a petition for
review of the final Early Reductions Program regulation in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit,

EPA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, No. 93&hyph;1179 (D.C. Cir.). On April 13, 1993, BAMM submitted an administrative petition to EPA to revise the RfC
for acrylic acid and to delete acrylic acid from the list of high-risk pollutants. BAMM submitted to EPA a new two-generation
reproductive study of acrylic acid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the new data led EPA to revise the RfC for acrylic acid. As a result, acrylic acid no longer meets the criteria
for inclusion on the high risk list.

II. Summary of and Rationale for the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Noncarcinogens meet the criteria for the high risk list if they have a verified RfC less than 0.5 micrograms per cubic
meter. The RfC for acrylic acid that was originally verified in August 1990 was 0.33 micrograms per cubic meter, based
on lesions of the nasal epithelium in a subchronic mouse inhalation study (Miller 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1981).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One of the uncertainty factors applied to the RfC for acrylic acid was a factor of three to account for the lack of a two-generation
reproductive study.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In January, 1994, BAMM submitted additional data to EPA including a new two-generation reproductive study in rats,
a developmental study in rabbits, and a bioavailability study in rats and mice. On February 15 and 16, 1994, the IRIS
RfC/ RfD Work Group met and considered, among other things, the new two-generation reproductive study (BASF, 1993).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Work Group found that the new study met the criteria for an adequate reproductive study and accordingly increased
the RfC for acrylic acid by a factor of three. The increase in the RfC for acrylic acid by a factor of three resulted in
a revised RfC of 1 microgram per cubic meter which was made publicly available on IRIS on April 1, 1994. The revised RfC
is sufficiently high to exclude acrylic acid from the Early Reductions Program high-risk list. Consequently, today's
action proposes to delete acrylic acid from the list of high-risk pollutants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), EPA must determine whether a regulation is ``significant''
and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the requirements of the Executive
Order. The order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs, or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``non significant regulatory
action''. Accordingly, a regulatory impact analysis has not been prepared and EPA has not submitted the action to
OMB for review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 federal agencies are required to assess the economic impact of federal regulations on small entities. Pursuant to
the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small business entities because the impact of the proposed rule is not significant.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to establish time-limited tolerances (with an expiration date of November 15, 1997) for residues of
the synthetic pyrethroid bifenthrin in or on the raw agricultural commodities (RACs) corn (field, seed, and pop)
grain, silage (forage), stover (fodder), milk, milk fat, meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses,
sheep, and poultry and eggs. The proposed regulation to establish maximum permissible levels for residues of the
pesticide in or on these commodities was requested in a petition submitted by FMC Corp. EPA also proposes to extend
tolerances for the residues of bifenthrin in or on cottonseed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA issued a notice, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 25, 1987 (52 FR 45237), which announced that FMC Corp., 1735 Market St., Philadelphia, PA 19103, had submitted
pesticide petition (PP) 7F3546 requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing tolerances for residues of
the pesticide bifenthrin, (2-methyl [1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl)methyl-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3,-trifluoro-1-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate,
and its 4'-hydroxy metabolite in or on the raw agricultural commodities corn (field, seed, and pop) grain at 0.05 part
per million (ppm), forage at 2.0 ppm, fodder at 4.0 ppm, milk at 0.02 ppm, milk fat at 0.20 ppm, meat at 0.10 ppm, fat at
0.30 ppm, and meat byproducts of goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.10 ppm. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the request of FMC Corp., EPA issued an amended notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41473), proposing that tolerances be established as follows: Corn (field, seed, and pop) grain
at 0.05 ppm (No detectable residues were found in grain at exaggerated rates, and the proposed tolerance is based on
method sensitivity), silage (fodder) combined residue of bifenthrin plus 4'-OH bifenthrin at 2.0 ppm, stover (fodder)
for the combined residue of bifenthrin plus 4'-OH bifenthrin at 5.0 ppm; milk, fat at 1.0 ppm (reflecting 0.1 ppm in
whole milk); meat of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.05 ppm; fat of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep
at 1.0 ppm; and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.10 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 8, 1993, FMC Corp. requested that the pesticide petition be amended by proposing that tolerances be established
in/on meat, fat, and meat byproducts of poultry and eggs at 0.05 ppm and by deleting the 4'-hydroxy metabolite from
the tolerance expression. This amendment was submitted in response to EPA's conclusion that although residues in
poultry from existing and proposed uses are expected to be nondetectable, tolerances should be set at the limit of
quantitation and that the residue to be regulated is bifenthrin per se and not the 4'hydroxy metabolite.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological
data considered in support of the proposed tolerances include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Metabolism studies in rats with single doses of 4 and 35 mg/kg demonstrate that about 90 percent of parent compound
and its hydroxylated metabolites are excreted. With doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day, significant bioaccumulation of the
parent compound can occur in tissues with high fat content, with half-lives in these tissues of about 50 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A 12-month feeding study in dogs fed dose levels of 0, 0.75, 1.5, 3.0, or 5.0 milligrams(mg)/kilogram (kg)/day with
a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 1.5 mg/kg/day. The lowest-effect level (LEL) for this study is established
at 3.0 mg/kg/day based on the occurrence of intermittent tremors in the test animals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A developmental toxicity study in rats given gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg/day with maternal and fetal
NOELs at 1.0 mg/kg/day. The maternal NOEL is based on the occurrence of tremors, and the fetal NOEL is based on an increased
incidence of hydroureter without hydronephrosis at the 2.0-mg/kg/day dosage level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A developmental toxicity study in rabbits given gavage doses of 0, 2.67, 4, or 8 mg/kg/day with no developmental
toxicity observed under the conditions of the study. The maternal NOEL is established at 4 mg/kg/day based on the occurrence
of twitching and tremors at the 8 mg/kg/day dosage level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A two-generation reproduction study in rats fed diets containing 0, 30, 60, or 100 ppm with no reproductive effects
or developmental toxicity observed under the conditions of the study. The maternal NOEL for the study is established
at 30 ppm (equivalent to 5 mg/kg/day) based on lower body weight in females.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Mutagenicity tests, including gene mutation in Salmonella, chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary
and rat bone marrow cells, HGPRT locus mutation in mouse lymphoma cells, and unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes,
were all negative. Bifenthrin was marginally active in a forward mutation test involving the thymidine kinase locus
in mouse lymphoma cells. These test results indicate a low mutegenic potential for bifenthrin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A 24-month feeding/carcinogenicity study with rats fed diets containing 0, 12, 50, 100, or 200 ppm with a systemic
NOEL of 50 ppm (equivalent to 2.5 mg/kg/day) based on tremors, elevated body weight, and higher liver and kidney organ-to-body
weight ratios. There were no carcinogenic effects observed under the conditions of the study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A carcinogenicity study with mice fed diets containing 0, 50, 200, 500, or 600 ppm (equivalent to 7.5, 30, 75, or 90
mg/kg/day) for 87 weeks (males) and 92 weeks (females) with a statistically significant trend for hemangiopericytomas
of the urinary bladder of male mice. In this study, male mice in the high-dose group (600 ppm) showed an increase in the
number of hemangiopericytomas of the urinary bladder as compared to the control group. Although the number of hemangiopericytomas
was twice as high in male mice at the high dose level compared to the control animals, the difference in rate of tumors
between the control group and the high-dose group was not statistically significant by pair-wise comparison. There
were also significant dose-related trends in hepatocellular carcinomas and in the combined hepatocellular adenomas
and/or carcinomas in male mice. Female mice had significantly higher incidences of combined lung adenomas and carcinomas
in the 50, 200, and 600 ppm groups, although there was no significant dose-related trend.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bifenthrin has been classified by the Office of Pesticide Programs' Health Effect's Division's Carcinogenicity
Peer Review Committee (CPRC) as a Group C carcinogen, i.e., possible human carcinogen. The Agency has chosen to use
the reference dose calculations to estimate human dietary risk from bifenthrin residues. The decision supporting
classification of bifenthrin as a possible carcinogen (Group C) rather than a probable carcinogen (Group B) was primarily
based on the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Evidence for carcinogenicity was only observed in mice; no compound- related increases in tumors were observed
in the carcinogenicity study in rats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. It is unlikely that the hemangiopericytomas observed in the mouse study were malignant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Mutagenicity studies do not support Group B classification for bifenthrin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Feeding studies using structurally related pyrethroids, which were classified as Group C carcinogens by the CPRC,
have resulted in increased incidences of lung tumors in female mice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A dietary exposure/risk assessment was performed for bifenthrin using a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.015 mg/kg of body
weight/day. The RfD is based on an NOEL of 1.5 mg/kg/day from the 1-year feeding study in dogs, which demonstrated intermittent
tremors in test animals at the lowest effect level, and an uncertainty factor of 100. The current estimated dietary
exposure for the overall U.S. population resulting from established tolerances is 0.000385 mg/kg bwt/day, which
represents 2.6 percent of the RfD. The current action will increase exposure to 0.001935 mg/kg bwt/day or 12.9 percent
of the RfD. In the subgroup population exposed to the highest risk, nonnursing infants less than 1 year old, the current
action would increase exposure to 0.007404 mg/kg bwt/day or 49.4 percent of the RfD. Generally speaking, EPA has no
cause for concern if total residue contribution for published and proposed tolerances is less than the RfD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA concludes that the chronic dietary risk of bifenthrin, as estimated by the dietary risk assessment, does not appear
to be of concern. The cancer risk to humans is considered negligible, given the weight of evidence considerations,
which only support the classification of bifenthrin as a possible carcinogen, and the low level of exposure to bifenthrin
residues in the human diet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The metabolism of the chemical in plants and animals for this use is adequately understood. Although a processing
study shows some concentration of bifenthrin residues in corn oil, EPA has determined that a section 409 food additive
regulation is unnecessary because it is unlikely that the bifenthrin residues in corn oil will exceed the limit of
quantification tolerance that is being established for bifenthrin in corn grain. Analysis of the field trial data
indicates that bifenthrin residue levels in corn grain will be lower than the grain tolerance by a factor greater than
the concentration factor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An adequate analytical method, gas-liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. The enforcement
methodology has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for publication in the Pesticide Analytical Manual,
Vol. II (PAM II). Because of the long lead time for publication of the method in PAM II, the analytical methodology is
being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow,
Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Divisions (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs,
Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1132,
CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-5232.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 5, 1988, EPA issued a conditional registration and time-limited tolerance for bifenthrin for use on cottonseed
with an expiration date of October 31, 1991 (see the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 15, 1988 (53 FR 30676)). On November 12, 1992, the conditional registration was amended and extended to November
15, 1993, and the tolerance on cottonseed extended to November 15, 1994 (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Registers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 20, 1993 (58 FR 54094) and February 22, 1994 (59 FR 9411)). On November 15, 1993, EPA amended the registration
on cottonseed by extending the expiration date to November 15, 1996. The registration was amended and extended to
allow time for submission and evaluation of additional environmental effects data. In order to evaluate the effects
of bifenthrin on fish and aquatic organisms and its fate in the environment, additional data were required to be collected
and submitted during the period of conditional registration. Such requirements included a sediment bioavailability
and toxicity study and a small-plot runoff study that must be submitted to the Agency by July 1, 1996. To be consistent
with the extension issued for the conditional registration, the Agency is proposing to extend the tolerance on cottonseed
and other commodities, and establish a time-limited tolerance on corn (field, seed, and pop) with an expiration date
of November 15, 1997, to cover residues expected to result from use during the period of conditional registration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which it is sought. Based on the information and data considered,
the Agency concludes that the proposed section 408 tolerances and extension will protect the public health. Therefore,
it is proposed that the tolerances be established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [PP 0E3921/P584]. All written comments filed in response to this petition
will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Victorian Chemical Co. Pty. Ltd., 37-49 Appleton St., P.O. Box 71, Richmond, Victoria, 3121 Australia, submitted
pesticide petition (PP) 4E4303 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(c) by establishing an exemption
from the requirement of a tolerance for ethyl oleate (ethyl esters of fatty acids derived from edible fats and oils)
when used as a solvent or cosolvent in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops or raw agricultural commodities
after harvest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125 and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statment
on inert ingredients published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. However, where it can be determined without
that data that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not require some or all
of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert
ingredient. The Agency has decided that no data, in addition to that described below, for ethyl oleate will need to
be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Ethyl oleate, as defined, is expected to be metabolized to ethyl alcohol and edible fatty acids, rendering it of
minimal toxicological concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. There is no significant difference between ethyl oleate and methyl oleate, which is approved under 40 CFR 180.1001(c).
In fact, as noted by the FDA (57 FR 12709, Apr. 13, 1992), on an equal basis, methyl esters of fatty acids have more toxic
potential than the ethyl esters because of the potential for the release of methyl alcohol.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The FDA has approved ethyl oleate as a direct food additive in aqueous emulsions for dehydrating grapes to produce
raisins under 21 CFR 172.225.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this ingredeint is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA
proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request within
30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [OPP-300345]. All written comments filed in response to this document will
be available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the Virginia address given
above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Du Pont Chemicals, Chestnut Run Plaza, P.O. Box 80711, Wilmington, DE 19880-0711, submitted pesticide petition
(PP) 1E3990 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a
tolerance for dimethyl ether (DME) when used as an aerosol propellant in pesticide formulations applied to animals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. The data submitted
in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement on inert ingredients
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. However, where it can be determined without
that data that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not require some or all
of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert
ingredient. The Agency has decided that no data, in addition to that described below, for dimethyl ether will need
to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A cardiac sensitization study in the dog with a no-observed-adverse- effect level (NOAEL) of 100,000 parts per
million and a lowest-observed-adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 200,000 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A 4-hour acute inhalation toxicity study in the male rat with an LC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 164,000 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. No evidence of mutagenicity with and without metabolic activation when exposed in a closed system to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 strains at concentrations determined in a cytotoxicity test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A 2-week inhalation study in rats with a NOAEL of less than 10,000 ppm. 5. A 4-week inhalation study in hamsters showing
changes in red blood cell counts in females and decreased white blood cell counts in both males and females and decreased
body weight and relative spleen weight in males with a NOAEL of 2,000 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A 13-week inhalation study in rats showing elevated neutrophil counts in all test groups with a NOAEL of less than
1,000 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A 13-week inhalation study in hamsters showing decreased red blood cell count and hemoglobin in males with a NOAEL
of 5,000 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A 2-year rat inhalation study in rats showing female rats had a statistically significant increase in total mammary
tumors at the highest concentration tested and a significant positive trend for total mammary tumors. The Cancer
Peer Review Committee concluded that this was due to the less-than-usual incidence of total mammary tumors in the
control group, compared to historical controls, and concluded that there was no convincing evidence of carcinogenicity
in this study. The systemic LOEL in this study is 0.2% (2,000 ppm) based on a significant increase in the incidence of
splenic congestion in males at 6 months, decreased red cell count in males and females at the mid and high doses at 6 months,
increased absolute spleen weight in males at the high concentration at 6 and 12 months, and congestion of the spleen
in males at the high dose at 6 months. The systemic NOEL is less than 0.2% (2,000 ppm). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Two rat developmental effects studies by inhalation with a NOEL for maternal toxicity of 2% DME and a NOEL for developmental
toxicity of 0.125% DME. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA
proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the revocation of certain tolerances, exemptions from tolerances, and food additive regulations
(``tolerances'') established under sections 408 and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C.
346a and 348) for residues of the insecticide/miticide tetradifon and the fungicide sulfur dioxide in or on raw agricultural
commodities (RACs) and processed foods. EPA is initiating this action because all registered food uses associated
with these tolerances, exemptions from tolerances, and food additive regulations have been canceled. The registrations
for sulfur dioxide and tetradifon were canceled because the registrant failed to pay the required maintenance fee
and/or the registrant voluntarily canceled all registered uses of the pesticide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the fact that there are no current food use registrations associated with these tolerances, exemptions from
tolerance, and food additive regulations, EPA proposes to revoke them. A tolerance, an exemption from tolerance,
or a food additive regulation is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical that is not registered for a particular
food use. The Agency is not recommending the establishment of action levels in place of these tolerance regulations.
Since there are no food use registrations associated with these tolerances, exemptions from tolerance, and food
additive regulations, and hence no legal use in the United States, and since these pesticides are either not persistent
or sufficient time has elapsed since their prior use for residues to dissipate, residues should not appear in any domestically
produced commodities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes to revoke the tolerances for residues of the insecticide/miticide tetradifon (2,4,5,4'-tetrachlorodiphenyl
sulfone) as listed in 40 CFR 180.174 in or on the following raw agricultural commodities: peppermint and spearmint
(100 ppm); fresh hops (30 ppm); figs (6 ppm); apples, apricots, cherries, crabapples, grapes, nectarines, peaches,
pears, plums (fresh prunes), quinces, and strawberries (5 ppm); citrus citron, grapefruit, lemons, limes, oranges,
and tangerines (2 ppm); cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, tomatoes, and winter squash (1 ppm); meat and milk (0 ppm). EPA
proposes to revoke the exemption from tolerance for residues of the fungicide sulfur dioxide as listed in 40 CFR 180.1013:
(1) liquid grain-fumigant formulations for marker or fire-retardant purposes at levels not exceeding 5 percent
by weight of such formulations are exempted from the requirement of a tolerance in or on barley, buckwheat, corn, oats,
popcorn, rice, rye, grain sorghum (milo), and wheat; (2) residues of sulfur dioxide resulting from postharvest fungicidal
use are exempted from the requirement of a tolerance in or on corn for feed use only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also proposes to revoke the food additive regulations for residues of the pesticide tetradifon (2,4,5,4'-tetrachlorodiphenyl
sulfone) as listed in 40 CFR 185.5475 in or on the following commodities: dried hops (120 ppm); dried figs (10 ppm);
dried tea (8 ppm).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, which contains sulfur dioxide or tetradifon may request, within 30 days
after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that the proposal to revoke the RAC tolerances be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e)
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation, revoking the tolerances and
exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for raw agricultural commodities, and food additive regulations for
processed foods. Further, EPA is soliciting comments from any person adversely affected by revocation of the tolerances,
exemptions from tolerance, and food additive regulations. EPA requests that anyone adversely affected by these
revocations submit information providing the following specific information: (1) Are there any existing stocks
of the chemical?; (2) If so, how much?; (3) When will the stocks be depleted?; (4) How long would the commodities treated
with these chemicals be in the channels of trade?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300336]. All written comments filed
in response to this document will be available for public inspection in the Public Response Section, at the Virginia

The Agency has conducted an analysis in order to satisfy requirements as specified by Executive Order 12866 and the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4. 1993), the Agency must determine whether a proposed regulatory action
being proposed is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory
Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant'') ;
(2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3)
materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel
legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this
Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354; 94 Stat. 1164, 5
U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have an economic impact on small businesses, small organizations,
or small governmental jurisdictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulatory action is intended to prevent the sale of food commodities containing pesticide residues where the
subject pesticide has been used in an unregistered or illegal manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since all domestic registrations for these uses of tetradifon and sulfur dioxide have been canceled, it is anticipated
that no economic impact would occur at any level of business enterprises if these tolerances, exemptions from tolerance,
and food additive regulations are revoked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, I certify that this regulatory action does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes that the tolerance exemptions for three encapsulating polymers, poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-eicosene),
poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-hexadecene), and vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer be amended to removed language
not directly related to the inert ingredient exemption and to replace the specific tolerance exemption listings
in 40 CFR part 180 for these polymers with general listings under 40 CFR 180.1001(c). This change was requested by International
Specialty Products. On its own inititative, the Agency is also deleting similar language in the tolerance exemption
for cross-linked polyurea-type encapsulating polymer.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 International Specialty Products (ISP), 1361 Alps Rd., Wayne, NJ 07470, has submitted petitions to amend the exemptions
from tolerance for poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-eicosene), pesticide petition (PP) 4E4307, poly(vinylpyrrolidone-1-hexadecene),
PP 4E4304, and vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, PP 4E4306, to remove the specific exemptions in 40 CFR
part 180 for these polymeric encapsulating agents and list them in 40 CFR 180.1001(c). The changes would eliminate
the following statement which was included in each separate exemption from tolerance: ``Registration of each new
pesticide formulation incorporating this dispersing agent must be supported by residue data for the active ingredient(s).''
The petition notes that it is EPA's policy that the data requirements for registration are associated with registered
pesticide products, not inert ingredients. Data may be required on a case-by-case basis for a registered product
when substantial changes are made in the inert ingredients included in the product's formulation, but such data requirements
are not triggered universally by the addition of a specific inert ingredient to the formulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The addition of this language to the tolerance exemption was triggered by concern that the nature of the inert encapsulating
material may affect the residue levels of active ingredients and, therefore, the Agency needed a mechanism to ensure
that each formulation of this type be evaluated for this possibility. However, the Agency agrees that including this
language in the exemption from tolerance expression is an inappropriate way to obtain such assurance. In August 1993,
the Agency issued to product managers internal guidance entitled, ``Data Requirements for Formulations and Translation
of Residue Data between Formulations.'' The document informed product managers that any new food-use pesticide
product which is considered a microencapsulated or controlled-release formulation should be reviewed by residue
chemists to determine ``if there has been a change in the inert ingredients (especially the encapsulating polymer)
that could affect residues of the active ingredient.'' This internal guidance should address the concerns which
led to the inclusion of the objectionable language in these tolerance exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the three polymers of these petitions, the Agency has noted that there is a specific exemption for cross-linked
polyurea-type encapsulating polymer (40 CFR 180.1039) that contains the same language as the three polymers for
which petitions were submitted as well as additional language on quality control procedures to ensure predictable
release characteristics and relatively uniform toxicity of various production lots. This language also refers
to data requirements for the encapsulated pesticide product formulation and is not appropriate to the tolerance
exemption for the inert ingredient. Therefore, the Agency has also decided to amend this exemption to delete the second
sentence of the tolerance exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein may request within

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [OPP-300348]. All written comments filed in response to this document will

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

On May 4, 1994, the Department of the Interior issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (59 FR 23097) to revise the natural
resource damage assessment regulations. The natural resource damage assessment regulations establish procedures
for assessing damages for injury to natural resources resulting from a discharge of oil into navigable waters under
the Clean Water Act, or a release of a hazardous substance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act. The Department is extending the period for comment on the proposed rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The natural resource damage assessment regulations establish procedures for calculating damages for natural resource
injuries under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (42 U.S.C.
9601 et seq.) and the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). The regulations provide an administrative
process for conducting assessments as well as two types of technical procedures for the actual determination of injuries
and damages. ``Type A'' procedures are standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field
observation in cases of minor discharges or releases in certain environments. ``Type B'' procedures are site-specific
procedures for detailed assessments in other cases.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 4, 1994, the Department issued a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing the assessment of damages for lost
nonuse values of injured natural resources using type B procedures. 59 FR 23097. Nonuse values are those economic
values that are not dependent on use of a resource and include the value of knowing that the resource exists and knowing
that a resource will be available for future generations. The only method currently available for the express purpose
of estimating nonuse values is the contingent valuation (CV) methodology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two provisions of the original natural resource damage assessment regulations restricted the use of type B procedures
to estimate lost nonuse values to cases in which lost use values could not be determined. 43 CFR 11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii)
(1993).

) held that these restrictions were inconsistent with section 301 of CERCLA. 880 F.2d 432, 464 (D.C. Cir. 1989). The
court remanded these provisions, along with several other issues, to the Department and ordered the Department to
promulgate new rules on the remanded issues. On March 25, 1994, the Department published a final rule addressing all
aspects of the court remand except the estimation of lost nonuse values. 59 FR 14262. The Department's March 25, 1994,
final rule renumbered 43 CFR 11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii) (1993) as new &sect;&sect;11.83(c)(1)(iii) and 11.83(c)(2)(vii)(B),
temporarily leaving the existing invalid rule language ``on the books'' without substantively addressing in any
way that language or the use of CV for estimating nonuse values. The May 4, 1994, Federal Register notice proposed standards
for the use of CV to estimate lost nonuse values. Pending the completion of this rulemaking, the existing restrictive
rule language concerning the estimation of lost nonuse values, which was struck down in

 remains invalid and ineffective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on the May 4, 1994, proposed rule was originally set to expire on July 7, 1994. The Department has
received several requests from the public for additional time to comment on the proposed rule and has decided to extend
the comment period to October 7, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is coordinating this rulemaking with a rulemaking being conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA). NOAA has published a proposed natural resource damage assessment rule under the Oil Pollution
Act (33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.). 59 FR 1061 (January 7, 1994). In a separate notice in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, NOAA is also announcing an extension of the comment period on its proposed rule. The proposed standards for the estimation
of lost nonuse values contained in the Department's May 4, 1994,

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission requests comments on a petition filed by Simla B. Ellis d/b/a SoTo Broadcasting, permittee of a new
FM station, Channel 266A, Mamou, Louisiana, proposing the substitution of Channel 266C3 for Channel 266A at Mamou
and modification of SoTo's authorization to specify operation on the higher powered channel. In order to accommodate
the upgrade at Mamou, we also propose to substitute Channel 286A for vacant Channel 266A at Jonesville, Louisiana.
Channel 266C3 and Channel 286A can be allotted to Mamou and Jonesville, respectively, in compliance with the Commission's
minimum distance separation requirements. Channel 266C3 can be allotted with a site restriction of 12.2 kilometers
(7.6 miles) east to accommodate SoTo's desired site. The coordinates for Channel 266C3 are 30&hyph;39&hyph;42 and
92&hyph;17&hyph;52. The coordinates for Channel 286A at Jonesville are 31&hyph;35&hyph;38 and 91&hyph;45&hyph;23.

This document requests comments on a petition by Michael Scott Clem seeking the allotment of Channel 255A to Galatia,
Illinois, as that community's first aural FM transmission service. Channel 255A can be allotted to Galatia in compliance
with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements with a site restriction of 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles)
northwest, in order to avoid a short-spacing to Station WKDQ(FM), Channel 258C, Henderson, Kentucky. The coordinates
for Channel 255A at Galatia, Illinois, are North Latitude 37&hyph;50&hyph;53 and West Longitude 88&hyph;37&hyph;10.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 By decision served May 24, 1994 (59 FR 27002, May 25, 1994), the Commission sought public comment by June 14, 1994, on
a proposal to revise its regulations pertaining to registration by motor carriers with States. The Commission now
is extending the due date for comments to June 28, 1994. The National Conference of State Transportation Specialists
(NCSTS) has advised the Commission that it is holding its annual conference between June 12 and 16, 1994, and that its
membership will have the opportunity to discuss the Commission's proposed amendments at the conference. As the conference
will not end until after the original due date for comments, the NCSTS requires an extension of the comment period.
The Commission therefore is granting an extension to give the NCSTS the time it needs to formulate and submit its comments.

Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining
members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (Service) endangered species
program. To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed
species native to the United States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for the conservation
of the species, establish criteria for reclassification or delisting, and estimate time and cost for implementing
the recovery measures needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

Railroad Valley springfish are endemic to two springs at Duckwater and four springs at Lockes, Railroad Valley, Nye
County, Nevada. The species has been introduced into four additional springs in Nevada outside the species' historical
range. Railroad Valley springfish are extant in all historical habitats and three introduction habitats. Populations
vary from fewer than one hundred to several thousand individuals. The principle causes of decline for this species
are habitat modification and nonnative fish introductions. All historical habitats are designated critical habitat
for this species. Railroad Valley springfish occupy habitats on private, Federal, and Indian Reservation lands.
Recovery of this species will require removal and/or control of nonnative fishes, restoration and protection of
occupied habitats, and protection of ground water sources.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations governing the campus-based programs (Federal Perkins Loan, Federal
Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) programs). These amendments
are needed to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). The Secretary also proposes
to reduce the administrative burden imposed on applicants for student financial assistance and educational institutions
resulting from the verification requirements by amending the verification regulations contained in subpart E of
the Student Assistance General Provisions, 34 CFR part 668.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Student Assistance General Provisions regulations implement requirements that are common to the student financial
assistance programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, (title IV, HEA programs). The title
IV, HEA programs include the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL), Federal Direct Student Loan,
State Student Incentive Grant (SSIG), Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Supplemental
Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 21, 1992, a notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requesting public comments on statutes and regulations that substantially impede economic growth, are no longer
needed, or otherwise impose unnecessary costs or burdens. The proposed change to the Student Assistance General
Provisions regulations results from the public comments received in response to that notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed amendments also revise the existing campus-based program regulations. The campus-based programs
are authorized as follows: Federal Perkins Loan_20 U.S.C. 1087aa&hyph;1087hh and 20 U.S.C. 421&hyph;429; FWS_42
U.S.C. 2751&hyph;2756b; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSEOG_20 U.S.C. 1070b&hyph;1070b&hyph;3. These proposed regulations would implement provisions of the Crime
Control Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;647), enacted November 29, 1990, the National and Community Service Act of 1990
(Pub. L. 101&hyph;610), enacted November 16, 1990, the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325),
enacted July 23, 1992 (Amendments), and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;208),
enacted December 20, 1993 (Technical Amendments). A description of the major proposed changes follows. The proposed
changes that pertain to more than one program are described first followed by descriptions of provisions that pertain
to only a specific program. The Federal student financial assistance programs support the National Education Goals
by enhancing opportunities for postsecondary education. The National Education Goals call for increasing the rate
at which students graduate from high school and pursue high quality postsecondary education and for supporting life-long
learning.

Section 668.57(c)&blank;Acceptable Documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The verification regulations contained in subpart E of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations (34
CFR part 688) govern verification of the information that is used to calculate an applicant's expected family contribution
(EFC) as part of determining an applicant's need for student financial assistance. The EFC is the amount that an applicant
and the applicant's family reasonably can be expected to contribute toward the applicant's cost of attendance at
an institution of higher education. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, dependent applicants are required to provide the signature of both parents when verifying the number
of family household members enrolled in postsecondary institutions. The Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;668.57(c)
to require the signature of one parent instead of both parents. If only one parent's income is considered in the title
IV, HEA aid awarding process, that is the parent who must sign. Otherwise, either parent may sign. This amendment is
being proposed in an effort to reduce the administrative burden imposed on applicants and institutions by the verification
requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current regulations restrict eligibility for Federal Perkins Loan and FWS assistance for undergraduate students
to those who have not already earned baccalaureate or first professional degrees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments changed the Federal Perkins Loan and FWS programs to provide that a student is not ineligible for assistance
because he or she has previously received a baccalaureate or professional degree. Therefore, the Secretary proposes
to amend the definition of ``undergraduate student'' to delete the restriction from the current Federal Perkins
Loan and FWS regulations. The statutory restriction remains for the FSEOG program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to amend &sect;&sect;674.4, 675.4, and 676.4 in accordance with amended sections 413D(e)(2),
422(e)(2), and 462(j)(4) of the HEA to state that if an institution returns more than 10 percent of its Federal Perkins
Loan, FWS, or FSEOG allocation for an award year, the institution will have its allocation for the next fiscal year
for that program reduced by the dollar amount returned. The Amendments established this requirement for the Federal
Perkins Loan and FSEOG programs. The same requirement was provided for the FWS Program by the Technical Amendments.
These statutory provisions authorize the Secretary to take appropriate measures to ensure effective use of program
funds when an institution fails to expend its allocation. The Secretary may waive these provisions if enforcement
would be contrary to the interest of the programs. To accomplish the purpose of the statute, the Secretary expects
to find enforcement to be contrary to the interest of the program in very limited circumstances, such as a natural disaster.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to amend &sect;&sect;674.10, 675.10, and 676.10 in accordance with amended sections 413C(d),
443(b)(3), and 464(b)(2) of the HEA to state that if an institution's FSEOG allocation, FWS grant, or Federal Perkins
Loan capital contribution is directly or indirectly based in part on the financial need of less-than-full-time or
independent students and if the need of all of these students exceeds 5 percent of the total need of all students at an
institution, then at least 5 percent of that allotment for FSEOG, 5 percent of that grant for FWS, or 5 percent of the
dollar amount of the loans made for Federal Perkins must be made available to these students.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 674.14, 675.14, and 676.14&blank;Overaward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A financial aid administratrato may not award or disburse aid from a campus-based program if that aid, when combined
with all other resources, would exceed the student's need. Before awarding aid from campus-based programs, the aid
administrator must take into account the aid that the student will receive from other student financial assistance
programs and other resources that the aid administrator knows about or can reasonably anticipate at the time aid is
awarded to the student. If the student receives additional resources at any time during the award period that were
not considered in determining the student's eligibility for aid, and these resources combined with the expected
financial aid will exceed the student's need, the amount in excess of the student's need is considered an overaward.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the situation in which an institution learns that a student has received additional resources that were not included
in calculating the student's eligibility for financial assistance, the regulations for the three campus-based
programs currently permit a student's resources to exceed the student's financial need by no more than $200. Further,
the current regulations allow an institution to continue to employ a student under the FWS program after the full financial
need has been met until the student's cumulative earnings from both need-based and non-need-based employment exceed
his or her financial need by more than $200. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 443(b)(4) of the HEA has been amended to allow a student employed under the FWS program to earn up to $300 from
need-based employment in excess of his or her financial need before employment under the FWS program must be discontinued.
In addition, for the purpose of determining when FWS funds may no longer be used to pay the student, an institution will
not be required to monitor the student's non-need-based earnings. (However, as in the past, earnings from non-need-based
employment will be counted as income for the following year.) Therefore, the Secretary is proposing to amend the regulations
for the FWS program in accordance with the statute to provide that a student employed under the FWS program may continue
to receive FWS funding after the student's full financial need has been met until the student's cumulative earnings
from need-based employment exceed his or her financial need by more than $300. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute does not address the common situation whereby a student receives a financial aid package consisting of
an FWS award in combination with a Federal Perkins Loan or FSEOG award or both. The Secretary is proposing to change
the current $200 overaward threshold for this situation. Under the proposed change, if FWS is awarded to a student
by itself or in combination with one or both of the other campus-based programs, then a $300 overaward threshold will
be in effect. However, under the proposed change, if a student is not employed under the FWS program but is receiving
a Federal Perkins Loan or FSEOG, the current regulatory $200 overaward threshold will still be in effect for those
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making awards, an institution may not make campus-based awards in excess of the amount of the student's need. Although
a threshold is allowed subsequent to the packaging of campus-based aid, the threshold does not allow an institution
deliberately to award campus-based aid that, in combination with other resources, exceeds the student's financial
need.

Section 676.16&blank;Payment of an FSEOG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to allow institutions to disburse a Federal Perkins Loan or an FSEOG award after a student ceases
to be enrolled under certain circumstances. Currently, the Federal Perkins Loan and the FSEOG programs do not provide
for late disbursements while the other title IV, HEA programs have provisions for late disbursements. This proposed
change would prevent a student from being penalized because the student did not receive funds that he or she needed
and expected due to a delay in payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would allow an institution to disburse funds under the Federal Perkins Loan and FSEOG programs to a student
when he or she is no longer enrolled if the assistance was awarded while the student was still an eligible student. Further,
the institution must determine that the funds are needed to cover the student's documented educational costs that
are normally included in the student's cost of attendance under section 472 of the HEA for the payment period for which
the loan or grant was intended and the student was actually enrolled. The institution would be expected to collect
and retain documentation supporting the amount of and the reason for the late disbursement paid to the student.

The ``Perkins Loan program'' will be known as the ``Federal Perkins Loan program.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 674.2&blank;Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 462(h) of the HEA replaced the dollar-volume ``default rate'' calculation in the Federal Perkins Loan program
with a borrower-based ``cohort default rate,'' beginning in the 1993&hyph;94 award year. Accordingly, the Secretary
proposes to amend &sect;674.2 to remove the definition of ``default rate,'' ``defaulted principal amount,'' and
``matured loans,'' which are definitions used in the calculation of an institution's ``default rate,'' but are not
used in the ``cohort default rate'' calculation. Section 462(h) of the HEA also provides that any loan on which the
borrower has made satisfactory arrangements to resume repayment is not counted toward an institution's cohort default
rate. ``Satisfactory arrangements to resume payment'' is a term currently used in the FFEL program. The Secretary
proposes to add the same definition of ``satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan'' to &sect;674.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments in section 464(c)(2)(A) of the HEA created a new economic hardship deferment and added a new provision
of forbearance in section 464(e), both of which were also provisions added to the FFEL program. Negotiated rulemaking
in the FFEL program resulted in the requirement that in order for a borrower to establish eligibility for an economic
hardship deferment or for forbearance of payments, the borrower would be required to provide certain documentation
to the granting institution, including evidence showing the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income.
The Secretary proposes to add the same definition of ``disposable income'' as resulted from the negotiated rulemaking
process for the FFEL program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 484 of the HEA now permits borrowers pursuing a second baccalaureate degree to receive assistance under the
Federal Perkins Loan program. The Secretary is, therefore, proposing to amend the definition of ``undergraduate
student'' in &sect;674.2 of the Federal Perkins Loan program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific date on which a loan is made to a borrower as well as the specific date on which a borrower enters repayment
on his or her Federal Perkins Loan is critical to the determination of eligibility for certain benefits (for example,
deferments, cancellations, exclusion from an institution's cohort default rate, interest rates, and grace periods).
However, there has been some confusion on the meaning of these concepts. Therefore, the Secretary proposes to incorporate
into the Federal Perkins Loan program regulations the definitions of the term ``making of a loan'' and the term ``enter
repayment.'' These definitions are based on common institutional practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is aware that the term ``Direct Loans'' when used to mean a ``National Direct Student Loan'' is the same
as the term used to mean the new ``Federal Direct Student Loan'' and will clarify the distinction between these two
terms.

Section 674.4&blank;Allocation and Reallocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to amend &sect;674.4 to incorporate the requirements in section 462(j) of the HEA that the
Secretary shall reallocate 80 percent of the available funds to institutions that participated in the Federal Perkins
Loan program in the 1985&hyph;86 award year but did not receive an allocation for the award year for which the reallocation
determination is made. The reallocated amount may not exceed the institution's fair share shortfall amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 462(j) of the HEA requires that the remaining 20 percent must be reallocated in accordance with the regulations.
The Secretary proposes to amend &sect;674.4 to provide for the flexibility to reallocate the 20 percent of unexpended
funds. This change would allow the Secretary to assist students who suffer financial harm from a natural disaster
such as a flood or hurricane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 462(e)(2) of the HEA requires the Secretary to establish an appeals process by which the anticipated collections
required in section 462(e)(1) may be waived for institutions with ``low default rates'' in the Federal Perkins Loan
program. The Secretary proposes to amend &sect;674.4 to incorporate an automatic appeals process. The Secretary
would waive the calculation of anticipated collections in section 462(e)(1) for any institution with a cohort default
rate that does not exceed 7.5 percent and would instead use an amount equal to actual collections during the second
year preceding the beginning of the award year.

Section 674.5&blank;Federal Perkins Loan Cohort Default Rate and Penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to add new &sect;674.5 to the regulations. This section establishes, in accordance with section
462(f) of the HEA, the Federal Perkins Loan program cohort default rate and penalties for an institution with a high
cohort default rate for the 1994&hyph;95 award year and subsequent award years. This section includes the definition
of which loans are to be included in the cohort default rate calculation and provisions detailing how the cohort default
rate would be calculated for an institution with more than one location or undergoing a change in status, in accordance
with section 462(h)(3)(G) of the HEA which requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations designed to prevent an
institution from evading the application of the cohort default rate because of situations such as changing control
of the institution. These provisions on calculating a cohort default rate for locations of an institution are the
same as in the FFEL Program.

Section 674.6&blank;Default Reduction Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to add new &sect;674.6 to the regulations. The proposed requirements in &sect;674.6 describe
measures that an institution participating in the Federal Perkins Loan program must take to reduce its cohort default
rate. Section 462(f) of the HEA now requires that beginning in the 1994&hyph;95 award year, if an institution's cohort
default rate equals or exceeds 15 percent, the institution must establish a default reduction plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Secretary's intent that an institution be able to coordinate its default reduction efforts in the Federal
Perkins Loan program with its default reduction plan under the requirements of the FFEL program. To that end, the Secretary
is proposing to require institutions with a cohort default rate that equals or exceeds 15 percent to implement a default
reduction plan that is similar to the plan established by the FFEL program in appendix D of part 668. Any substantive
differences from appendix D are related to characteristics specific to the FFEL program. Section 674.6(b) describes
the plan that an institution will be required to establish to reduce Federal Perkins Loan defaults by its students
in the future.

Section 674.7&blank;Expanded Lending Option (ELO) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments, in section 463(a)(2)(B) of the HEA, established the Expanded Lending Option (ELO) beginning in the
1993&hyph;94 award year for institutions with default rates of 7.5 percent or less that have executed an ELO participation
agreement with the Secretary. The Technical Amendments further amended that section to provide for a cohort default
rate of 15 percent or less to participate in the ELO for the 1994&hyph;95 award year and subsequent award years. This
was necessary because a default rate will no longer be calculated for an institution. Instead, as required by the Amendments
the default rate calculation has been replaced by a cohort default rate calculation for the Federal Perkins Loan Program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Institutions that receive a Federal Capital Contribution (FCC) and participate in the ELO are required to match the
FCC on a dollar-for-dollar basis and are allowed to make loans to students at higher annual maximum and aggregate loan
limits than is the case at nonparticipating institutions. The Secretary proposes to add this section to incorporate
these statutory changes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 463(a)(2)(B) of the HEA increased the capital contribution requirements for institutions that have a participation
agreement with the Secretary to participate in the Federal Perkins Loan program in the 1993&hyph;94 award year and
subsequent award years. The Secretary proposes to include in the participation agreement, under &sect;674.8, these
new capital contribution requirements. In addition, the HEA eliminated the definition of default rate and implemented
the cohort default rate, which includes new reporting requirements. The Secretary therefore proposes to amend the
regulations to incorporate new reporting requirements containing information that the Department will use to determine
an institution's cohort default rate.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments to section 461(a) of the HEA provide for the eligibility of a student engaged in a program of study abroad.
This program must be approved for credit by the home institution. The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations
to reflect this statutory change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations to incorporate the new statutory requirement (section 464(b)(1)
of the HEA) that a student must provide a driver's license number, if any, to the institution at the time of application
for the Federal Perkins Loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also proposes to amend &sect;674.9 to require that, to establish eligibility to receive additional
Federal Perkins Loan funds, a borrower must reaffirm a Federal Perkins Loan debt that was previously cancelled due
to the borrower's total and permanent disability, discharged in bankruptcy, or written off (if the amount of the write
off exceeded $25). This proposal has been incorporated from the current Federal Family Education Loan program regulations
as part of the Secretary's on-going effort to maintain similar provisions, wherever possible, in the title IV, HEA
student loan programs. This proposal would treat any borrower who has not satisfied a previous Federal Perkins Loan
debt in a manner that is consistent with 34 CFR 668.7(a)(7), which provides that a borrower who is in default on a Federal
Perkins Loan is ineligible for new loans. It is the Secretary's position that cancellation in exchange for performing
a service (such as teaching in a low-income school or teaching disabled children) satisfies the debt but cancellation
for total and permanent disability or bankruptcy does not satisfy the debt.

The Amendments establish annual maximum loan amounts and increase the aggregate maximum loan amounts allowable
for an eligible student. These amounts depend on whether the student is attending an institution that participates
in the ELO or whether the student is in a program of study abroad approved for credit by the home institution. The Secretary
proposes to amend the maximum loan limits in &sect;674.12 to reflect the statutory changes.

The Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;&sect;674.13, 674.19, 674.31, 674.41, 674.47, and 674.49 to remove all
references to the term ``endorser'' in accordance with section 464(c)(1)(E) of the HEA, which now provides that Federal

The Amendments require an institution to report to any one national credit bureau organization with which the Secretary
has an agreement the amount of the Federal Perkins Loan made to a borrower. The Technical Amendments require that an
institution report this information at least annually. The Secretary proposes in &sect;674.16 to incorporate the
new statutory requirement that an institution report loan disbursements to a national credit bureau organization,
in accordance with section 463(c)(4) of the HEA. In addition, the Secretary proposes to establish procedures by which
a borrower may not be required to sign for any advance of funds made while the borrower is in a program of study abroad,
if obtaining the borrower's signature would pose an undue hardship on the institution.

The Amendments provide for an institution to transfer up to 25 percent of its Federal Capital Contribution allotment

The Secretary is proposing, in accordance with amended section 464(c) of the HEA, to allow an institution to increase
to $40 the minimum monthly repayment amount provided for in the loan agreement. This provision applies to loans for
which the first disbursement is made on or after October 1, 1992, to a borrower who on the date the loan is made owes no
balance on any Federal Perkins Loan or National Direct Student Loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amendments also established forbearance of principal and interest, or principal only, as requested in writing
by the borrower, if the borrower's monthly title IV, HEA loan repayment obligation equals or exceeds 20 percent of
the borrower's monthly disposable income. The institution may also grant forbearance to a borrower if it identifies
other reasons that warrant it. The Secretary proposes to add this provision to this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To encourage repayment of defaulted loans, the Amendments provide that the Secretary may authorize an institution
to compromise on the repayment of a loan if the borrower pays: (1) At least 90 percent of the loan; (2) all interest due;
and (3) any collection fees due. The Secretary is proposing to include this authority in this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective for loans made on or after July 1, 1993, the deferment provisions under the Federal Perkins Loan Program
will change in accordance with amended section 464(c)(2)(A) of the HEA. The Secretary is proposing to revise the regulations
to reflect this change. Loan repayment for these loans may be deferred for periods during which a borrower: (1) Is at
least a half-time student; (2) is pursuing a course of study in a graduate fellowship program approved by the Secretary
or in a rehabilitation training program for disabled individuals approved by the Secretary, excluding a medical
internship or residency program; (3) is, for a period not to exceed three years, unable to find full-time employment;
(4) is, for a period not to exceed three years, suffering an economic hardship; or (5) is engaged in service described
under the cancellation provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of economic hardship proposed in these regulations is the same as the definition of economic hardship
as was proposed in the FFEL program notice of proposed rulemaking, published on March 24, 1994. The Secretary will
incorporate the same definition of economic hardship into the Federal Perkins Loan, the FFEL, and the Federal Direct
Student Loan program regulations based on public comments received on this notice, the FFEL program notice, the discussions
of the negotiators during the Federal Direct Student Loan program negotiated rulemaking sessions, and the public
comments received on proposed regulations in the Federal Direct Student Loan program.

statute of limitations as a limitation on recovering amounts owed on defaulted accounts. The Secretary is also proposing
to amend this section to clarify that these regulations preempt State collection laws. This change is needed because
some states do not allow a collection agency to collect a Federal Perkins Loan if the collection agency is not physically

services in a public or other nonprofit program under public supervision by the lead agency. The Secretary proposes
to add this section to incorporate these changes.

Section 674.57&blank;Cancellation for Law Enforcement or Corrections Officer Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 465(a)(2) of the HEA was amended by the Police Recruitment and Education Program (PREP), a provision of the
Crime Control Act of 1990. PREP provides for Federal Perkins Loan and National Direct Student Loan cancellation benefits
for full-time law enforcement or corrections officers providing service to local, State, and Federal law enforcement
or corrections agencies. The provision only applies to Federal Perkins Loans and Direct Loans made on or after November
29, 1990. The Secretary is proposing to add a new &sect;674.57 to the regulations to reflect these provisions. In developing
&sect;674.57, the Secretary relied on the experience gained from the Law Enforcement Education Program (LEEP),
a highly successful program in the 1970's that provided financial assistance to law enforcement officers to attend
an institution of higher education. The concepts of an eligible agency, a law enforcement officer, and eligible service
were drawn from LEEP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National and Community Service Act Amendments of 1990 authorized the creation of full- and part-time national
and community service programs. In an effort to increase participation in community service, Congress amended the
statement of purpose for the FWS program, in section 441(a) of the HEA, to encourage students receiving program assistance
to participate in community service activities. The Secretary proposes to amend &sect;675.1(a) in accordance with
the statute.

of the Federal Perkins Loan program regulations. The Secretary believes that the ``income protection allowance''
(IPA) is the best indicator of a ``low-income individual.'' Also, the IPA charts are very accessible because the Secretary
publishes annually in the

The Secretary is proposing to amend the provisions governing the program participation agreement between the Secretary
and the institution in &sect;675.8 in accordance with the statutory change in section 443(b) of the HEA to add assurances
that: (1) employment under the program may be used to support programs for supportive services to students with disabilities;
and (2) institutions will inform all eligible students of the opportunity to perform community service and will consult
with local nonprofit, governmental, and community-based organizations to identify community service opportunities.
In identifying community service opportunities, the Secretary expects institutions to consult with their students.

Section 675.18&blank;Use of Funds

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is proposing several amendments to &sect;675.18. First, in accordance with section 448(b)(1) of the
HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.18(a) to provide that institutions participating in the Work-Colleges
program may use funds allocated under section 442 of the HEA for meeting costs of the Work-Colleges program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, in accordance with section 447 of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.18(b)(5) to eliminate
the institutional administrative expense allowance for work-study for community service learning. Institutions
would, however, be allowed to use up to 10 percent of the funds available for the institution's administrative cost
allowance and attributable to the institution's FWS program expenditures to cover expenses incurred for its program
of community services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, in accordance with section 488 of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.18(f)(1) to increase
the amount of an institution's allocation under the FWS programs that may be transferred to the FSEOG program from
10 percent to 25 percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fourth, in accordance with section 445(b)(2) of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.18 to provide
that an institution is authorized to make payments to students for services performed on or after May 15 of the previous
award year but prior to the beginning of the succeeding award year (that is, for summer employment) from the succeeding
award year's allocation. This carry-back authority would be in addition to the existing authority to carry-back
10 percent of the succeeding year's allocation for use at any time during the preceding award year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifth, in accordance with section 443(b)(2)(A) of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.18 to provide
that institutions are required to use at least 5 percent of the total funds granted to the institution to compensate
students employed in community service activities for the 1994&hyph;95 and subsequent award years. If an institution
is unable to comply with this requirement to provide community services, the institution may request a waiver of this
requirement. The Secretary will approve a waiver if the Secretary determines that enforcing this requirement would
create a hardship for students at the institution. The public is invited to comment on the circumstances under which
the community service requirement might create a hardship for students.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations provide that a proprietary institution may employ a student to work for the institution in jobs
that are in community services but also involve the provision of student services that are directly related to the
work-study student's training or education. In accordance with section 443(b)(8) of the HEA, as amended by the Technical
Amendments, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.21(b) to provide that a student employed by a proprietary
institution and performing community services is no longer also required to be furnishing student services. This
change would help promote community services because of the limited employment opportunities that satisfy both
types of services.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations provide that the Federal share of FWS compensation paid to a student employed other than by a for-profit
organization may not exceed 70 percent. In accordance with section 443(b)(5) of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing
to amend &sect;675.26 to increase the Federal share to 75 percent. However, the Federal share of FWS compensation
paid to a student employed by a for-profit organization still may not exceed 50 percent as established by the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that the Secretary will continue to authorize a Federal share of 100 percent of the compensation
earned by students during an award year if all of the following criteria are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The work performed by the student is for the institution itself, for a Federal, state or local public agency, or for
a private nonprofit organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The institution at which the student is enrolled is designated as an eligible institution under the Strengthening
Institutions Program (34 CFR part 607), the Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities Program
(34 CFR part 608), or the Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions Program (34 CFR part 609). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations provide for a separate ``Community Service Learning program'' under the FWS programs. In an
effort to increase participation in community service activities in the title IV, HEA programs, Congress amended
the statement of purpose for the FWS program to encourage students to participate in community service activities.
The Amendments removed the authority for a separate ``Community Service-Learning program'' and instead require
institutions to employ a percentage of their FWS students in community service jobs. As a result of this change, the
Secretary is proposing to remove &sect;675.28 from the regulations.

Current regulations provide for two separate Job Location and Development programs: (1) A regular JLD program to
expand off-campus job opportunities for students enrolled in eligible institutions of higher education who, regardless
of their financial need, want jobs; and (2) a ``Community Services'' JLD program to locate and develop community services
jobs for students with financial need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.31 in accordance with amended section 446 of the HEA to combine the two
programs into one program to expand off-campus job opportunities for students enrolled in eligible institutions,
regardless of their financial need. The Secretary is further proposing to amend &sect;675.31, in accordance with
the amended statement of purpose for all the FWS programs in section 441(a) of the HEA, to include in the statement of
purpose for the JLD program the encouragement of participation in community service activities. Also, in accordance
with amended section 446 of the HEA, the Secretary is proposing to amend &sect;675.32 to allow an institution to use
the lesser of $50,000 or 10 percent of the institution's allocation to establish or expand a program to locate and develop
jobs, including community service jobs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amendments added new section 448 to the HEA to establish the ``Work-Colleges program.'' Congress created this
program to encourage comprehensive work-learning programs and recognize the special nature of institutions that
choose to make work-learning a central part of their educational programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the statute, institutions that satisfy the definition of ``work-college'' may apply to the Secretary to participate
in the Work-Colleges program. The term ``work-college'' under the statute means an eligible institution that (1)
has been a public or private nonprofit institution with a commitment to community service; (2) has operated a comprehensive
work-learning program for at least two years; (3) requires all resident students who reside on campus to participate
in a comprehensive work-learning program and the provision of services as an integral part of the institution's educational
program and as part of the institution's educational philosophy; and (4) provides students participating in the
comprehensive work-learning program with the opportunity to contribute to their education and to the welfare of
the community as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comprehensive work-learning program does not provide only narrowly career-oriented or job-skill-oriented employment.
It provides work experiences that teach basic habits and attitudes, responsibility, interpersonal relations,
communication, teamwork, self analysis, organizational behavior, problem solving, leadership and other lessons
that are not job specific or career specific. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute requires that funds made available to work-colleges must be matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis from
non-Federal sources. In addition to any amounts appropriated, the statute allows work-colleges to also use FWS program
funds and Federal Perkins Loan funds to provide flexibility in strengthening the self-help-through-work element
in financial aid packaging.

the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens
specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere
in this preamble under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary invites comments on how to make these proposed regulations easier to understand, including answers
to questions such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the proposed regulations clearly stated? (2) Do the
regulations contain technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of the
regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity? Would
the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section'' is preceded
by the symbol ``&sect;'' and a numbered heading, for example, &sect;674.4

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Default penalty
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If an institution's cohort default rate meets the following levels, a default penalty is imposed on the institution
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 15 percent, the institution must establish a default
reduction plan in accordance with &sect;674.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 20 percent, but is less than 25 percent, the institution's
FCC is reduced by 10 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 25 percent, but is less than 30 percent, the institution's
FCC is reduced by 30 percent.

(4) If the institution's cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30 percent, the institution's FCC is reduced to zero.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cohort default rate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) The term ``cohort default rate'' means, for any award year in which 30 or more current and former students at the
institution enter repayment on a loan received for attendance at the institution, the percentage of those current
and former students who enter repayment in that award year on the loans received for attendance at that institution
who default before the end of the following award year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In determining the number of students who default before the end of the following award year, the Secretary excludes
any loans that, due to improper servicing or collection, would result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation
of the cohort default rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For any award year in which less than 30 current and former students at the institution enter repayment on a loan
received for attendance at the institution, the ``cohort default rate'' means the percentage of those current and
former students who entered repayment on loans received for attendance at that institution in any of the three most
recent award years and who defaulted on those loans before the end of the award year immediately following the year
in which they entered repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Defaulted loans to be included in the cohort default rate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For purposes of calculating the cohort default rate under paragraph (b) of this section_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A borrower must be included only if the borrower's default has persisted for at least_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 240 consecutive days for loans repayable in monthly installments; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 270 consecutive days for loans repayable in quarterly installments; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A loan is considered to be in default if a payment is made by the institution of higher education, its owner, agency,
contractor, employee, or any other entity or individual affiliated with the institution, in order to avoid default
by the borrower; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) Any loan that is in default, but on which the borrower has made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan,
or any loan that has been rehabilitated before the end of the following award year is not considered to be in default
for purposes of the cohort default rate calculation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of a student who has attended and borrowed at more than one institution, the student and his or her subsequent
repayment or default are attributed to the institution for attendance at which the student received the loan that
entered repayment in the award year; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Improper servicing or collection means the failure of the institution to comply with subpart C of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Locations of the institution
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all locations of the institution as it exists on the first day
of the award year for which the rate is calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A cohort default rate of an institution applies to all locations of the institution from the date the institution
is notified of that rate until the institution is notified by the Secretary that the rate no longer applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For an institution that changes status from a location of one institution to a free-standing institution, the
Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the institution's status as of July 1 of the award year for which
a cohort default rate is being calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4)(i) For an institution that changes status from a free-standing institution to a location of another institution,
the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during
the applicable award year and the combined number of students who default during the applicable award years from both
the former free-standing institution and the other institution. This cohort default rate applies to the new consolidated
institution and all of its current locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For free-standing institutions that merge, the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined
number of students who enter repayment during the applicable award year and the combined number of students who default
during the applicable award years from both of the institutions that are merging. This cohort default rate applies
to the new, consolidated institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For an institution that changes status from a location of one institution to a location of another institution,
the Secretary determines the cohort default rate based on the combined number of students who enter repayment during
the applicable award year and the number of students who default during the applicable award years from both of the
institutions in their entirety, not limited solely to the respective locations.

and the combined number of students who default during the applicable award years from the institution under both
the old and new control.
