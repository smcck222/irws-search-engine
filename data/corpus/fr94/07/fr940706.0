This action has also been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612).
William E. Ludwig, Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Only State and local welfare agencies will be affected
to the extent that they are involved with appeals of Food Stamp Program quality control claims. The procedures to appeal
quality control claims are being changed by this rule to streamline and reduce the time and resources State and local
welfare agencies previously devoted to such appeals. Potential and current participants in the Food Stamp Program
will not be affected.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 19, 1993, the Department issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) at 58 FR 5188 to implement section
603 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 (HPA) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;435). The HPA amended the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as
amended (the Act) (7 U.S.C. 2011&hyph;2032) regarding the Food Stamp Program's administrative review process for
QC claims (7 U.S.C. 2023(a)). A total of eight comment letters were received on the proposed rule. One commenter subsequently
advised the Department that it considered its comment letter to be inappropriate to the subject of the NPRM and withdrew
its letter. The following analysis is based on the remaining seven comment letters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuance of the proposed regulations on January 19, 1993, Congress has enacted Chapter 3, Title XIII of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66 (Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act) (Leland Act)
to further streamline the appeals process for QC claims established under section 16(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 2025(c).
Section 13951 of the Leland Act amended sections 13(a)(1), 14(a) and 16(c) of the Act to: (1) Provide that State agencies
will be assessed interest on outstanding QC liabilities if the administrative appeals process takes more than one
year to resolve these claims; (2) to establish timeframes for the administrative review process and (3) to provide
that an administrative law judge (ALJ) shall consider a State agency's contention of good cause when considering
whether to waive all or part of a State agency's QC liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A full explanation of the rationale of the proposed rule is contained in its preamble. It is suggested that interested
parties refer to that preamble for additional background information (58 FR 5188). Following is a detailed discussion
on the comments received on the proposed rule, non-discretionary revisions based on the Leland Act and the provisions
of the final rule. The Department has determined that, with respect to the revisions based upon non-discretionary
provisions of the Leland Act referenced above, notice and comment are unnecessary since the Department has no discretion
with respect to these provisions. accordingly, such revisions have been made through this final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Time: In &sect;283.4(a) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that a State agency must file a notice of appeal within
10 days of receipt by certified mail or personal service of the bill for collection from FNS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received three comments on this provision. One commenter stated that the 10-day time span to file the
written notice of appeal was too short and that a 30-day period would be more reasonable. Two commenters indicated
that it was unclear whether the notice of appeal or the bill for collection must be served by certified mail or personal
service. These commenters questioned if it was FNS' intent to require that the notice of appeal be filed by certified
mail or personal service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered the comment urging extension of the 10-day requirement but cannot adopt this suggestion.
Section 13951 of the Leland Act retained the 10-day filing requirement for the notice of appeal but provides that the
filing deadline shall be extended by the ALJ for cause shown. The Department believes that the requirements for the
content of the notice of appeal are minimal and should not pose any undue difficulty for the State agency to meet the
10-day filing deadline. If an extension is requested, the request and cause for such request must be submitted to the
ALJ or chief judge prior to the expiration of the 10-day filing deadline. The Department has also revised &sect;283.22(f)
to incorporate this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also notes that section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act authorizes the ALJ to extend the deadlines for
filing of the appeal petition, answer, rebuttal and initial decision for cause shown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered the comment concerning the service of the notice of appeal and has revised this section
to clarify that it is not FNS' intention to require the State agency to file the notice of appeal by certified mail or
personal service. As discussed in the preamble to the NPRM, the State agency will have 10 days from receipt of the bill
for collection to file a notice of appeal with the Hearing Clerk. Section 283.22(b) of the NPRM provides that the notice
of appeal is considered to be filed on the date that it is postmarked or, if hand delivered, the date it is received by
the Hearing Clerk. FNS will continue its policy of issuing the bill for collection either by certified mail or personal
service. Once the State agency receives the bill for collection, it will have 10 calendar days to file its notice of
appeal, unless an extension is requested prior to the expiration of the 10-day filing deadline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exhaustion of Administrative remedies: The Department has added new &sect;&sect;283.4(b) and 283.25(b) to clarify
that the State agency must appeal the bill for collection to the ALJ in order to exhaust available administrative remedies
as a prerequisite to seeking judicial review. While the Department believes it is clear that Congress intended section
14(a) of the Act to require the State agency to exhaust an administrative appeal before the ALJ before seeking judicial
review, the rule has been clarified to specifically require such exhaustion. Thus, the decision of the ALJ is final
for purposes of judicial review. However, as discussed in the preamble regarding &sect;283.17(c)(3), either party
to the appeal may, at its option, seek reconsideration of ALJ decision or review by the Judicial Officer. Accordingly,
&sect;&sect;283.4 (b)&hyph;(c) of the NPRM have been renumbered as &sect;&sect;283.4 (c)&hyph;(d) and &sect;&sect;283.25
(b)&hyph;(h) of the NPRM have been renumbered &sect;&sect;283.25 (c)&hyph;(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Content of the notice: In &sect;283.4(c) of the NPRM, the Department proposed the information which an acceptable
notice of appeal must contain and that failure to file an acceptable notice of appeal would result in a dismissal of
the notice by the ALJ and a waiver of the opportunity for further review unless the State agency pursues reconsideration
by the ALJ or review by the Judicial Officer.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter indicated that there were no provisions for
a State to remedy a technical defect or omission in a notice of appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered the comment concerning the technical defect or omission from the notice of appeal,
and has determined that adoption of this suggestion is unnecessary since the NPRM contains provisions for a State
to remedy a technical defect or omission in a notice of appeal. As discussed in &sect;283.4(c)(2) of the NPRM, if the
ALJ dismisses the notice of appeal because the State agency fails to file an adequate notice, the State agency may remedy
the defect and either request reconsideration by the ALJ or review by the Judicial Officer in accordance with &sect;&sect;283.17(d)
and 283.20 of the NPRM. These provisions would not apply for failure to file a timely notice of appeal or request for
extensions of time to file. This section has been renumbered in the final rulemaking as &sect;283.4(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good Cause: In &sect;283.4(d) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the Secretary's determination concerning
good cause be final and not subject to an appeal to the ALJ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter objected to the fact that FNS' good cause determinations
will not be subject to the appeal process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act deleted the provision of section 603 of the HPA which provided that the Secretary
retained the authority to waive some or all of a State's QC claim where the Secretary determined that the State agency
had good cause for failure to meet its error rate goal and that the decision of the Secretary was not subject to review
by the ALJ. The Leland Act requires that the ALJ, in considering a State agency's appeal of QC liability consider all
grounds for denying the claim, in whole or in part, including the contention of a State agency that the claim should
be waived, in whole or in part, for good cause. The Department intends to publish a proposed rulemaking addressing
the good cause criteria, as defined in the Leland Act. The regulation will be used by the Secretary and/or the Secretary's
designee to assess, evaluate and respond to claims by the State for a good cause waiver of liability in conjunction
with the appeals process. The Department has deleted &sect;283.4(d) of the NPRM. Additionally, &sect;283.5(a)
of the NPRM has been amended to reflect Leland Act changes to good cause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Receipt of notice of appeal and assignment of docket number: In &sect;283.4(e)(iii) of the NPRM, the Department proposed
that the Hearing Clerk would acknowledge timely receipt of the notice of appeal and advise the State agency that the
appeal petition must be filed within 30 days of service of the Hearing Clerk's letter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter indicated that the 30-day deadline for filing
the appeal petition is too burdensome for States and that a 60-day deadline would be more appropriate. The commenter
believed that the extended time period would enable States to obtain necessary legal support and to better develop
appropriate arguments in support of the appeal petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has revised the deadline for filing the appeal petition from 30 days to 60 days. Section 13951(c)(4)
of the Leland Act requires that the State agency submit evidence in support of the appeal not later than 60 days after
receiving a notice of the claim and provides that the ALJ shall extend the 60-day deadline for cause shown. As previously
discussed, &sect;283.22(f) of this final rule requires the State agency to file a written request for the extension
prior to the due date for the submission with a showing of cause for the extension. This provision is in keeping with
the legislative intent of the HPA that the appeals process be streamlined and the appeal procedures be as expeditious
as possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stay of Collection: In &sect;283.4(f) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that a timely notice of appeal would automatically
stay collection action on the QC claim. However, interest would continue to accrue on the outstanding claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that since the NPRM would allow the Department
to seek review by the Judicial Officer, the final determination of the ALJ may be delayed beyond the two year period
during which interest on a QC claim would not accrue. The commenter suggested that in order to avoid the imposition
of interest due to a delay that the State agency did not seek, the accrual of interest should be tolled (suspended) during
the review by the Judicial Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has considered this comment but cannot adopt this suggestion. Section 13951(a)(2) of the Leland Act
provides that interest on the unpaid claim would accrue either from a date that is one year after the date the bill is
received or the date of the decision on the administrative appeal, whichever is earlier. The Leland Act does not allow
a suspension of interest beyond the one-year period, regardless of the reason for the delay in a final administrative
decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Content of the Appeal Petition: In &sect;283.4(g)(3) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the State agency must
request an oral hearing and that failure to request that hearing would result in the forfeiture of the opportunity
for an oral hearing. The QC claim would then be decided using the procedures established under subpart C.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter suggested that rather than making an oral hearing
an option for the State agency, the Department should make this a standard element in the process which the State must
request be omitted if the State wishes an appeal to be decided without oral hearing. The commenter argued that this
change would avoid any misunderstanding on the part of the State agency or the Department as to whether the State intended
to request an oral hearing.

The Department has considered this comment and has decided not to adopt the suggestion. Section 603 of the HPA provides
that determinations regarding a QC claim shall be made on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing. In
addition, section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act requires that, on the request of the Secretary or the State agency,
the ALJ shall hold an evidentiary hearing. The Department is retaining the provisions of the NPRM which require that
the State agency notify the Hearing Clerk in its appeal petition if the State agency desires an oral hearing. The Department
wishes to emphasize that a State agency that waives an oral hearing would not generally be permitted to later request
that an oral hearing be conducted. The Department will amend &sect;283.4(g)(3) to cross-reference &sect;283.15(a)
to clarify those circumstances under which it would be possible for a State agency to receive an oral hearing if it had
not initially requested the oral hearing in its appeal petition. In addition, the Department has added &sect;283.4(i)
to provide that if no hearing had been requested, the appeal would proceed in accordance with the procedures set forth
under subpart C (Summary Procedure for Appeals of QC Claims of Less than $50,000). In the event that the appeal is pursued
under subpart C, procedures exist under &sect;283.26(a) to provide the State agency with an opportunity to request
an oral hearing if the State agency does not believe that the summary procedure is adequate for handling the appeal
and that an oral hearing is necessary.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment recommending that FNS be given 60 days in which to file an answer to the State agency's
appeal petition. The commenter also agreed with the provision that failure to file a timely answer would be considered,
for purposes of the appeal, an admission of the State agency's allegations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has revised the deadline for FNS to file an answer to the State agency's appeal petition from 30 days
to 60 days. Section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act requires that not later than 60 days after a State agency submits evidence
in support of the appeal, the Secretary shall submit responsive evidence to the ALJ and provides that the ALJ shall
extend the 60-day deadline for cause shown. As previously discussed, &sect;283.22(f) of the final rule requires
the Secretary to file a written request for the extension prior to the due date for the submission with a showing of cause
for the request.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that the preamble and the regulations
do not contain a timeline in which the motion for a hearing is to be filed. The commenter suggested that it would be difficult
to conclude that both parties would be knowledgeable if a motion for a hearing was filed with the appeal petition or
the answer to the appeal petition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is revising this provision to incorporate section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act which requires the
State agency to submit rebuttal evidence to the ALJ, to the extent such evidence exists, not later than 30 days after
the Secretary submits responsive evidence. The Department is retaining the provision in the NPRM which allows either
party to amend the appeal or answer at any time prior to the other party filing a motion for a hearing. An amendment following
such a motion would require approval by the ALJ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department wishes to clarify that the motion for a hearing would not be filed with the appeal or the answer to the
appeal. Rather, as discussed in &sect;283.15(b), a motion for a hearing is filed by either party after the completion
of all scheduled prehearing actions (such as discovery) that were agreed upon during the prehearing conference,
scheduling conference or as otherwise established by the ALJ. The filing of a motion for a hearing advises the ALJ and
the other parties to the appeal that the party has completed all prehearing activities and is ready to proceed with
the hearing. Because the timing for the filing of the motion for a hearing is dependent upon the completion of all previously
agreed upon prehearing activities, it is not possible to provide an absolute timeline as to when a motion for a hearing
would be filed.

Section 283.10: Consent Decision

This section of the NPRM contains the provision allowing the parties to the appeal to mutually agree to end the appeal

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter suggested that this section be modified to state
clearly that the parties may enter into a stipulation as to facts and that this would not preclude further review of
the legal issues. The commenter was concerned that legal issues would not be considered if the underlying basis for
the legal issues were facts which were not in dispute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and has decided not to adopt it since the concerns of the commenter are addressed
in &sect;283.11, the pre-hearing conference (and similarly in &sect;283.29_scheduling conference). As provided
for in &sect;283.11(c), one purpose of the ALJ conducting a prehearing conference is to allow the parties to consider
the possibility of obtaining stipulations as to facts in order to expedite and aid in the disposition of the appeal.
The Department wishes to clarify that the purpose of the consent decree is to allow the parties to mutually agree to
conclude the appeal process prior to the ALJ issuing an initial decision on the merits of the appeal. It is similar to
settlement of a civil action in court. The consent decree is not subject to further review by the Judicial Officer or
the Federal court. The appeals process contains prehearing procedures to allow the parties to enter into a stipulation
as to facts which would not preclude further review of the legal issues. Furthermore, the Department believes that
stipulations as to facts may be appropriate at any point to further expedite the appeal.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this proposal. The commenter noted that given the multiplicity of issues to
be addressed at the prehearing conference, any party should be entitled to obtain a stenographic transcript of a prehearing
conference at its own expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and has revised &sect;283.11(d) to clarify that any party may petition
the ALJ to allow for a stenographic transcript of a prehearing conference at the petitioner's own expense. A copy of
the prehearing transcript must be made available to the ALJ and the other parties to the appeal at no cost to the other
parties. In response to this comment, the Department has also revised &sect;283.15(o) to clarify that the cost of
preparing the hearing transcript and providing one copy of the transcript to the ALJ and the other parties to the appeal
shall be borne by the party requesting the hearing. The Department further notes that where these costs are incurred
by the State, such costs are eligible for reimbursement in accordance with part 277 of the Food Stamp Program regulations.

Depositions: In &sect;283.12(a) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the ALJ could order the taking of depositions
in order to elicit testimony which otherwise might not be available at the time of the hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received five comments on this provision. All of the commenters objected to restricting the use of
depositions to those instances in which testimony might not otherwise be available. One commenter argued that the
States' right to due process at the administrative appeal level was in jeopardy. Another commenter noted that by categorically
prohibiting the use of depositions other than to preserve testimony, FNS has seriously compromised the States' ability
to challenge error-rate penalty claims. This commenter also argued that by preventing the ALJ from using discovery
depositions as one tool of litigation management, FNS has compromised the ALJ's ability to preside over the taking
of evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered these comments but has not adopted them. It is the Department's position that the use
of depositions should be restricted to those instances in which the witness may be unavailable to testify at the hearing.
The Department believes that the discovery procedures provided in the NPRM for interrogatories, admissions, request
for production of documents, and depositions, as well as the prehearing conference, provide adequate discovery
tools for the parties to prepare for the oral hearing or to submit cross motions for summary judgment pursuant to &sect;283.30.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department believes that permitting discovery depositions would result in substantial costs and
delay in the appeals process. The Department recognizes that a significant goal of the amendments to the Act by section
603 of the HPA was to create a more efficient appeals process. The House Report states that an objective of section 603
of the HPA was to ``streamline[] the appeals process of the quality control system.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*''
H.R. Rep. No. 828, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 32 (1988). Further, Representative Panetta stated during debate of the HPA,
``(a) third set of changes aims to speed the resolution of financial claims against State agencies for excessive error
by streamlining the appeals process and providing for the payment of interest.'' 134 Cong. Rec. 20,982 (1988). Representative
Emerson reiterated this same intention. 134 Cong. Rec. 20,984 (1988). The Department believes that restricting
the use of depositions to those instances in which the witness may be unavailable to testify at the hearing is in keeping
with the stated intent of Congress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interrogatories and Admissions: In &sect;&sect;283.12(b) (1) and (2) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that
the parties be limited to fifteen interrogatories and admissions, including subparts, unless additional questions
were authorized by the ALJ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received five comments on these provisions. All of the commenters objected to limiting the number
of interrogatories and admissions. One commenter noted that given the ALJ's authority to limit discovery, it would
be more efficient not to impose an arbitrary limit on the number of interrogatories and admissions. The commenter
argued that the responding party could request a protective order from the ALJ if it felt that the requests were burdensome.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered these comments and has revised &sect;&sect;283.12(b) (1) and (2) to permit twenty-five
interrogatories and admissions, including subparts, unless additional questions are authorized by the ALJ. The
Department continues to believe that a limit on the number of interrogatories and admissions available without approval
by the ALJ is reasonable given the authority of the ALJ to authorize an increase in that number. The Department disagrees
that it should be the responsibility of the responding party to pursue a protective order if the scope of the discovery
is burdensome. Rather, it is reasonable to place the responsibility on the requesting party to justify why the ALJ
should authorize an increase in the number of interrogatories and admissions. This limit is also consistent with
congressional intent to streamline the appeals process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Production of Documents: In &sect;283.12(b)(3) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that any party to the appeal
may serve a request for the production of documents that are in the possession or control of another party. The Department
also proposed that the requested documents would be provided upon payment of fees for search and duplication of the
documents.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received two comments on this provision. One commenter noted that while the preamble to the NPRM contained
a provision requiring that the requested documents be relevant to the issues under appeal, the regulatory language
did not contain that requirement. The commenter suggested that the Department adopt the standard set forth in the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The second commenter opposed the assessment of fees for the production of documents.
The commenter noted that since only governmental agencies are participating in the review of the QC claim, the Department
ought to forgo the assessment of fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered the comment concerning the issue of the relevancy of the documents and has decided to
revise &sect;283.12(b)(3) to be consistent with Rule 26(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered the comment concerning the assessment of fees for the production of documents and has
decided not to adopt it. The Department believes that it is consistent and equitable that the costs of the search and
duplication of documents under a request for production be borne by the party making the request. State agencies may
submit such costs for reimbursement under 7 CFR part 277.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postponements or delays: In &sect;283.12(b)(4) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the hearing or other proceedings
of the appeal process would not be postponed or delayed pending a response to or resolution of issues pertaining to
a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter strongly disagreed with the proposal that no
delays or postponements of the QC appeal occur pending receipt of documents requested under FOIA. The commenter argued
that documents requested under FOIA may be crucial to the resolution of the appeal and suggested that either a timeline
should be imposed for furnishing documents requested under the FOIA or delays/postponements should be accepted
as part of the process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment but has decided not to adopt it. The Department has established procedures
for the production of documents which would negate the need for a party to the appeal to pursue document production
under the provisions of FOIA. As provided for in &sect;283.12(b)(3) of the NPRM, the parties to the appeal are afforded
the opportunity under the discovery process to request all documents relevant to the issues under appeal or which
would reasonably lead to the discovery of such documents. In addition, the ALJ will establish the deadline by which
all discovery activities must be completed. While the Department must process the FOIA and provide all responsive
nonprivileged documents, it is inappropriate to delay or postpone the QC appeal pending action on the FOIA request.
This also furthers congressional intent to streamline the appeals process. This section has been renumbered in the
final rulemaking as &sect;283.12(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Witnesses and Exhibits: In &sect;283.12(b)(9)(ii) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that a witness whose name
did not appear on the list of witnesses would not be permitted to testify at the hearing. In addition, exhibits which
were not provided to the opposing party 15 days prior to the hearing would not be admitted into evidence at the hearing
absent a showing of cause.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received two comments on this provision. The commenters argued that there may be situations where
a witness identified on an exchanged list is unavailable to testify at the hearing. However, the party may have a substitute
witness not identified on the exchanged list who is available to testify. The party should be permitted to amend the
list upon a showing of cause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that there are circumstances where it is unnecessary to exchange documents during the prehearing
process because those documents are already in the possession of each party through their normal course of business.
The commenter argued that under this circumstance the regulation should require that the parties need only identify
documents in the possession of the opposing party and notice an intention to introduce them at the hearing.

 The Department has considered the comment concerning witnesses and has revised the regulations to clarify that it
is the intent of the Department that in those situations where a party shows cause as to the reason a witness's name did
not appear on the witness list, upon motion and approval by the ALJ, that witness will be permitted to testify at the
hearing. The Department also wishes to clarify that if this situation arises, the other parties to the appeal may request
a delay in the hearing to allow for an opportunity to prepare for this previously unidentified witness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered the comment concerning the exchange of documents and has determined that adoption
of this suggestion is unnecessary since &sect;283.11(a)(3) of the NPRM provides the parties with the option of either
furnishing copies or a list of documents that the party anticipates relying upon at the hearing. Since exhibits are
not necessarily previously existing documents which are in the possession of the other party, the Department is retaining
the provision concerning the exchange of exhibits. This section of the NPRM has been moved in the final rulemaking
to &sect;283.15(d).

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment concerning the organization of this section. The commenter suggested that since
&sect;&sect;283.12(b)(6) (Inclusion in the record) and (9) (Exchange of witness and rebuttal witness lists, statements
and exhibits) relate to the hearing procedures, these two subsections should be moved to &sect;283.15.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and has adopted this suggestion. The Department has made the following
changes from the NPRM: &sect;283.12(b)(9) has been moved and renumbered as &sect;283.15(d) and &sect;283.15(b)(6)
has been moved and renumbered as &sect;283.15(i). The remaining sections of 283.15 have been renumbered, as necessary.

 In &sect;283.15(b) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the ALJ shall schedule a hearing upon receipt of a motion
by any party setting forth the issue and stating that the matter is ready for a hearing.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter indicated that this provision could be interpreted
as allowing the ALJ to deny a party's request for a hearing. The commenter suggested that this section be revised to
clarify that this section pertains only to the scheduling of a hearing. The commenter also noted that this section
suggests that a hearing is permitted only if material facts are disputed and suggested that this section should be
revised to permit the ALJ to hear oral arguments on legal issues even if there are no material facts in dispute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act requires that the ALJ decide the appeal within 60 days after receipt of rebuttal
evidence by the State agency, or, if no rebuttal evidence is submitted, within 90 days after the State submits the notice
of appeal and evidence in support of the appeal. Given these statutory deadlines, the ALJ shall establish at the prehearing
conference the dates by which the parties must complete prehearing activities. The parties would, following completion
of such activities, file a motion stating that they are ready for hearing. The Leland Act authorizes the ALJ to extend
certain statutory deadlines for cause shown. The Department anticipates that the ALJ may extend procedural deadlines
for cause shown to accommodate the completion of prehearing and posthearing activities as is shown to be necessary.
As previously discussed, &sect;283.22(f) of the final rule requires the parties to file a written request for an extension
prior to the due date with a showing of cause for the extension requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered the comment concerning the motion for a hearing and has determined that a revision to
this provision is unnecessary, other than to eliminate the requirement to set forth the issues within the motion.
The Department believes that the issues will be adequately framed by the prehearing procedures. Upon filing for a
motion for hearing, an oral hearing will be scheduled within the statutory time frames provided by the Leland Act,
unless an extension has been requested and granted by the ALJ or the ALJ has extended the time frames 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

sua sponte.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered the comment concerning the ALJ conducting an oral hearing on the legal issues when there
are no material facts in dispute. The Department has not adopted this suggestion. The Department wishes to clarify
that the purpose of the oral hearing is to present the facts which are in dispute. If it is determined or agreed at prehearing
or otherwise that there are no material facts in dispute, then the appropriate course of action would be to pursue resolution
of the remaining legal issues utilizing the procedures established under subpart C_Summary Procedure for Appeals
of QC Claims of Less than $50,000. These legal issues should be the basis for cross motions for summary judgment. In
view of the comment received, the Department has revised &sect;283.31(d) to allow the ALJ to request oral argument,
if necessary, in those instances when a stipulation of all material facts has been entered by the parties to the appeal.

Time and Place:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In &sect;283.15(b) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the hearing before the ALJ shall be held at the Department
of Agriculture, Washington, DC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received two comments on this provision. Both commenters objected to the hearings being held exclusively
in Washington, DC and suggested that the ALJ should determine the location of the hearing taking into account the convenience
of the parties and their witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and has revised &sect;283.15(b) to permit the ALJ to hold the hearing at
a location more convenient to the parties and their witnesses upon a showing of unusual or extraordinary circumstances.
The Department has determined that budgetary constraints will not be considered an unusual or extraordinary circumstance
since these costs are eligible for reimbursement, in part, in accordance with part 277 of the Food Stamp Program regulations.
The Department believes that requiring a showing of unusual or extraordinary circumstances takes into consideration
such burdens of the parties while also preserving the efficiency of the appeals process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Order of appearance: In &sect;283.15(f) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that FNS would have the burden of proving,
by a preponderance of the evidence, the QC claim against the State and that the State agency would have the burden of
proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the facts upon which it bases its appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter argued that contrary to the intent of Congress,
the proposed rule shifted the burden of proof to the States. The commenter suggested that this section be modified
to require that FNS, and not the States, bear the burden of proving its error-rate penalty claim against the State.
This burden of proof would be required for all factual matters put in issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and has determined that a revision to this provision is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department, however, wishes to reiterate that it has the ultimate burden of persuasion, by a preponderance of
the evidence, of the QC error rate claim against the State throughout the appeals process. Nothing in the NPRM or this
final rule changes that burden. However, if the Department makes a prima facia case, the burden of going forward with
the evidence upon which the State bases its appeal shifts to the State agency. The State must prove any evidence offered
to meet this burden of going forward by a preponderance. It is well settled that a fact can never be proven by something
less than a preponderance of the evidence. This section has been renumbered in the final rulemaking as &sect;283.15(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Objections: In &sect;283.15(h) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that at the hearing any party may object to a ruling
by the ALJ and that any objection not made to the ALJ could not be raised if there were a subsequent review by the Judicial
Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that there appeared to be some confusion
of intent between the preamble and the regulatory language. The commenter questioned if it was the intent of the Department
to limit materials presented to the Judicial Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and wishes to clarify that the review by the Judicial Officer shall be based
on decisions rendered by the ALJ. The ALJ must have been provided the opportunity to render a decision on an issue before
that issue can be appealed to the Judicial Officer. If a party to the appeal fails to raise an objection to the ALJ, that
objection cannot be raised with the Judicial Officer since the ALJ had not rendered a decision on that objection. This
section has been renumbered in the final rulemaking as &sect;283.15(j).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Official Records or documents: In &sect;283.15(j) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that official government
records or documents could be admitted into evidence without the production of the person who prepared the document.
The party could either submit the officially published document or a certified copy of the document. The Department's
Office of General Counsel would prepare the certification for FNS and other Departmental records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that this procedure was too cumbersome
since it apparently would require that States go to the USDA General Counsel to certify each and every FNS document,
including policy statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and wishes to clarify that State agencies would only be required to request
that the USDA General Counsel certify FNS documents if such documents are not officially published documents. The
Department also wishes to clarify that official records or documents may include official State government records
or documents. In similar fashion, for unpublished State documents, any necessary certification would be provided
by State personnel having the legal authority to make such certification. This section has been renumbered in the
final rulemaking as &sect;283.15(l).

Section 283.17: Post-Hearing Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the NPRM contains the procedures which will be followed at the completion of the hearing before the
ALJ. This section includes the requirements for post-hearing submissions by the parties to the appeal as well as the
issuance of the ALJ decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ALJ's initial decision: In &sect;283.17(c)(1) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the ALJ would issue a decision
on the appeal within a reasonable period of time after the termination of the time allowed for filing of proposed findings
of fact, conclusions of law, orders, and any briefs in support thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act requires that the ALJ decide the appeal within 60 days after receipt of rebuttal
evidence by the State agency, or, if no rebuttal evidence is submitted, within 90 days after the State submits the notice
of appeal and evidence in support of the appeal. The Department has revised &sect;&sect;283.17(c)(1) and 283.32(a)
to incorporate this legislative provision. As previously discussed, &sect;283.22(f) of the final rule requires
the State agency to file a written request for the extension prior to the due date for the submission with a showing of
cause for the extension.

ALJ's Initial decision.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In &sect;283.17(c)(3) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that no decision would be final for purposes of judicial
review except a final decision of the Judicial Officer upon appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that if the decision of the ALJ is adverse
to the State agency, judicial review by the Federal court should not be precluded because the State agency did not seek
review by the Judicial Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and has revised the final rule to provide that the initial decision of the
ALJ is considered final for purposes of judicial review. However, this would not preclude FNS, or any other party to
the appeal, from seeking either reconsideration by the ALJ or review by the Judicial Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Motion for Reconsideration: In &sect;283.17(d)(3) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that a response to the motion
for reconsideration would be allowed only upon the request of the ALJ.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received two comments on this provision. The commenters argued that a response to a motion for reconsideration
should be the standard procedure rather than at the discretion of the ALJ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and has revised &sect;283.17(d)(3) to provide that the other parties
to the appeal shall respond within 10 days of receipt of the brief or written materials filed by the party requesting
reconsideration unless an extension has been requested and granted by the ALJ or the ALJ has extended the time frame

Motion for Reconsideration: In &sect;283.17(d)(4) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the parties to the appeal
could not pursue a motion for reconsideration if the initial ALJ decision had been revised based upon a previous motion
for reconsideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that other agencies permit a party to file
a motion for reconsideration at any time, as of right, on the basis of material error, new evidence, or substantially
changed circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment but has decided not to adopt it. The Department believes that with the modification
to &sect;283.17(d)(3) allowing all parties to the appeal to respond to the initial motion for reconsideration, any
further requests for review of the ALJ's decision should be made to the Judicial Officer.

This section of the NPRM contains the procedures related to the filing of motions and requests with the ALJ or the Judicial
Officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response to motions and requests: In &sect;283.18(d) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that a party have 20 days
to respond to a motion or request and that the party initiating the motion or request not be permitted to reply to the
response of the other party unless ordered to do so by the ALJ.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter argued that by not being permitted to file a reply
brief, the party initiating the motion or request is disadvantaged since the initiating party would not have access
to arguments raised in response to the motion or request. The commenter recommended that one response be allowed each
party after the initial motion and response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment but has decided not to adopt it. This provision is in keeping with the congressional
intent that the appeal process be streamlined and that the appeal procedures be as expeditious as possible. Since
the ALJ can direct 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sua sponte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that a reply be filed either to clarify issues or upon motion in those instances where a party believes that a reply is
necessary, the Department believes that restricting the number of responses to a motion or request which may be filed
would not be disadvantage to the party initiating the motion or request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has also revised the 20-day time frame to respond to a motion or request in order to address the statutory
deadlines established by section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act for the completion of the appeals process. Given these
deadlines, the Department has shortened the 20-day time frame to 10 days unless an extension has been requested and

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received four comments on this provision. The commenters objected to this provision arguing that
the HPA prohibits Secretarial review of decisions made by the ALJ. The commenters recommended that the Department
delete this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered these comments but has decided not to adopt the recommendation to forgo Secretarial
review of the initial ALJ decision. As discussed under &sect;283.17(c)(3), the Department has revised the regulations
to provide that the initial decision of the ALJ shall be considered final for purposes of judicial review. However,
this would not preclude any party to the appeal from seeing reconsideration by the ALJ or review by the Department's
Judicial Officer within 30 days of the ALJ's decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Department's position that the specific incorporation of section 557 of the Administrative Procedure Act
(APA) (5 U.S.C. 557) by section 603 of the HPA necessarily means that the Secretary is authorized to review ALJ decisions.
Indeed, the APA expressly provides that an agency action can be final for purposes of the APA, and thus for purposes
of judicial review, even though it is subject to reconsideration or appeal to a higher authority within the agency.
5 U.S.C. 704. This interpretation is consistent with both the expressed statutory language and legislative history
of section 603 of the HPA.

 Memorandum for Alan C. Raul, General Counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture, from Douglas R. Cox, Deputy Assistant
Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, U.S. Department of Justice (February 20, 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has also determined that review by the Secretary of issues raised on appeal is a more efficient process
for resolving disputes concerning initial ALJ decisions that if such issues were brought to the federal courts without
providing the Secretary the opportunity to review and, if necessary, revise such decisions. The Secretary has delegated
to the Judicial Officer the authority to act as the final deciding officer in adjudicatory proceedings subject to
5 U.S.C. 556 and 557. Section 283.20 will permit the Judicial Officer, on behalf of the Secretary, to address the party's
objections to the initial ALJ decision, to apply expertise on the issues under review, exercise informed discretion,
and create a more concise record for any subsequent judicial review. This procedure will also ensure that there is
continuity in the decisions which are rendered for cases involving similar issues.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Submission of briefs: In &sect;283.20(h)(i) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that if the Judicial Officer determined
that there were reasonable grounds that additional evidence which is material was not presented to the ALJ, the Judicial
Officer shall remand the matter back to the ALJ for disposition.

Comment:

to limit materials presented to the Judicial Officer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has considered this comment and wishes to clarify that the Judicial Officer reviews the record created
before the ALJ. However, if a party to the appeal can persuade the Judicial Officer that there are reasonable grounds

This section of the NPRM contains the procedures which are to be followed if the appeal is being pursued under subpart
C_Summary Procedures for Appeal of QC Claims of Less than $50,000.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter expressed a concern that the 35 page limitation
on the brief accompanying the motion for summary judgment and the 15 page reply brief limitation were too restricted
and recommended that a higher page limit be established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department considered this comment but decided not to adopt it. The Department believes that given the authority
of the ALJ to increase the size of the brief and reply brief, the page limitations are reasonable. These page limits
are consistent with congressional intent to streamline the appeals process. The Department has also made changes
to subpart C to conform to the timeframes specified in the Leland Act.

Interrogatories.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A party may submit written interrogatories to any other party to an appeal. The time for submitting and responding
to written interrogatories shall be set by the ALJ at the pre-hearing conference, but in no event shall the time for
response be less than 20 days from the date of service or within such time as determined upon motion to the ALJ. The number
of interrogatories submitted by each party shall not exceed twenty-five questions including subparts, unless additional
interrogatories are authorized by the ALJ. Each interrogatory should be answered separately and fully in writing,
unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection should be stated in lieu of an answer. The answers
are to be signed under penalty of perjury by the person making them. Objections shall be signed by the attorney of record
in the appeal or by the responding party's authorized representative.

Request for admissions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A party may submit a written request for admission of the truth of any matters relevant to the appeal to any other party
to the appeal. The time for submitting a written request for admission shall be set by the ALJ at the pre-hearing conference.
The number of admissions contained in a request submitted by a party shall not exceed twenty-five unless additional
admissions are authorized by the ALJ. The matter is admitted unless, within 20 days after service thereof, or within
such time as determined upon motion to the ALJ, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting
the admission a written answer or objection addressed to the matter signed by the party, counsel or designated representative.
If objection is made, the reasons therefor should be stated. The answer should specifically deny the matter or set
forth in detail why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. An answering party may not give
lack of information or knowledge as a reason for the failure to admit or deny unless it is stated that reasonable inquiry
has been made and that the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny.
A party who considers that a matter for which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for hearing may
not, on that ground alone, object to the request; the party may deny the matter or set forth reasons why the matter cannot
be admitted or denied.

 (i) Any party may serve upon any other party to the appeal a request for production of documents which are in the possession
or control of the party upon whom the request is served. The time for service and response to such a request shall be set
by the ALJ at the pre-hearing conference. Upon payment of fees for search and duplication of documents, any party to
the appeal may obtain copies of such documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Parties may request production of any documents regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action. Grounds for objection will not exist if the information sought appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 A party who knows or later learns that a response is incorrect is under a duty to correct such response as soon as possible.
A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under a duty to supplement
the response to include information thereafter acquired. A party is under a duty to supplement responses with respect
to any question directly addressed to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 The ALJ shall limit, upon motion of a party, the frequency or extent of discovery if the ALJ determines that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that
is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy,
limitations on the parties' resources, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.

 In issuing a protective order, the ALJ may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance,
embarrassment, oppression or undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) That discovery not be had;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a deponent fails to respond or gives an evasive or incomplete answer to a question propounded at a deposition pursuant
to paragraph (a) of this section or a party fails to respond or gives evasive or incomplete answers to written interrogatories
or admissions, or fails to respond, in full or in part, to a request for production of documents served pursuant to paragraph

Decision of the ALJ.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The ALJ may grant a motion to compel production or deny a motion for a protective order only if the ALJ finds that the
discovery sought is necessary for the expeditious, fair, and reasonable consideration of the issues; it is not unduly
costly or burdensome; it will not unduly delay the proceeding; and the information sought is not privileged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The initial decision of the ALJ regarding the motion to compel the production of privileged documents or the motion
for a protective order shall become final and effective 10 days after service unless either party pursues the options
as discussed in &sect;&sect;283.17(d) and 283.20.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

of the ALJ, such refusal may subject the refusing party to proceedings to compel compliance with the ALJ's order in
the appropriate United States district court.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A party may request a hearing on the facts by including such request in its Appeal Petition or Answer, whichever is appropriate.
Failure to request a hearing within the time specified shall constitute a waiver of the opportunity for such a hearing,
except as provided for under &sect;283.4(i). In the event FNS denies any material facts and fails to request a hearing,
the matter may be set down for hearing on motion of the State agency or upon the ALJ's own motion.

and the convenience and necessity of the State agency and FNS. The hearing shall be held at the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Washington, DC. Upon a showing of unusual or extraordinary circumstances, the ALJ may order that the hearing be held
at another location. The ALJ shall file a notice stating the time and place of the hearing. If any change in the time of
the hearing is made, the ALJ shall file a notice of such change, which notice shall be served upon the parties, unless
it is made during the course of an oral hearing and made a part of the transcript or actual notice given to the parties.

(1) Witness and rebuttal witness lists, copies of prior statements of proposed witnesses, and copies of proposed
hearing exhibits, including copies of any written statements or depositions that a party intends to offer in lieu
of live testimony in accordance with &sect;283.12(a)(7), shall be exchanged at least 15 days in advance of the hearing
or at such other time as may be set by the ALJ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A witness whose name does not appear on the witness list shall not be permitted to testify and exhibits which were
not provided to the opposing party as provided above shall not be admitted into evidence at the hearing absent a showing
of cause and as authorized by the ALJ.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deparment of attorney or representative. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Whenever an ALJ finds that a person acting as attorney or designated representative for any party to the appeal
is guilty of unethical or contumacious conduct in, or in connection with an appeal, the ALJ may order that such person
be precluded from further acting as attorney or representative in the appeal. Review by the Judicial Officer may be
taken on any such order, but no appeal of the QC claim shall be delayed or suspended pending disposition of the debarment
review by the Judicial Officer. Provided, however, that the ALJ shall suspend the appeal of the QC claim for a reasonable
time for the purpose of enabling the party to obtain another attorney or representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whenever it is found, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that a person who is acting or who has acted as attorney
or representative for another person in any proceeding before the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is unfit to act
as such counsel because of such unethical or contumacious conduct, such person will be precluded from acting as the
attorney or representative in any or all proceedings before the Department as found to be appropriate.

Failure to appear. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If FNS or the State agency, after being duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing without cause, that party shall
be deemed to have waived the opportunity for an oral hearing and to have admitted any facts which may be presented at
the hearing. Such failure by either party shall also constitute an admission of all the material allegations of fact
contained in any pleadings submitted by the other party. The party who appears shall have the option of whether to follow
the procedure under &sect;283.7 or to present evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of declarations or by oral testimony
before the ALJ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Failure to appear at a hearing shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to be served with a copy of the ALJ's initial

in accordance with &sect;283.20.

Order of proceeding.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Except as may be decided otherwise by the ALJ, FNS shall proceed first at the hearing. FNS has the burden of proving,
by a preponderance of the evidence, the QC claim against the State agency for a QC error rate in excess of the tolerance
level. The State agency will proceed second and must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the facts upon which
it bases its appeal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evidence.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The testimony of witnesses at a hearing shall be on oath or affirmation and subject to cross-examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Upon a finding of cause, the ALJ may order that any witness be examined separately and apart from all other witnesses
except those who may be parties to the appeal or whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation
of the party's cause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After a witness called by either party has testified on direct examination, any other party may request and obtain
the production of any statement, or part thereof, of such witness in the possession of the opposing party which relates
to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified. Such production shall be made according to the procedures
and subject to the definitions and limitations prescribed in the Jencks Act (18 U.S.C. 3500).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible
persons are accustomed to rely, shall be excluded by order of the ALJ insofar as practicable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Inclusion in the record.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the oral hearing or as ordered by the ALJ, depositions to the extent deemed admissible, written interrogatories,
written requests for admission and respective responses may be offered in evidence by the party at whose instance
they were taken. If not offered by such party, they may be offered in whole or in part by any other party. If only part of
a deposition, written interrogatory, written request for admission or response thereto is offered in evidence by
a party, any other party may require that all of it, which is relevant to the part introduced, be offered, and any party
may introduce any other parts. Such depositions, written interrogatories, written requests for admission and respective

If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement, it shall be included in the transcript in toto. If the evidence consists
of a document or other exhibit, it shall be marked for identification and inserted in the hearing record. In either
event, if the Judicial Officer, upon review, determines that the ALJ's ruling excluding the evidence was erroneous
and prejudicial, the evidence shall be considered a part of the transcript and hearing record. If the Judicial Officer
determines that the ALJ's ruling excluding the evidence was erroneous and prejudicial, and that it would inappropriate
to have such evidence considered a part of the hearing record without reopening the hearing, the Judicial Officer
may direct that the hearing be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence or for any other purpose in connection
with the excluded evidence.

The failure by FNS to file an answer shall constitute a waiver of the opportunity to file a cross motion for summary judgment
pursuant to &sect;283.30. Upon such failure to file, the State agency shall file a proposed decision, along with a
motion for adoption thereof, both of which shall be served upon FNS by the State agency. Within 10 days after service
of such motion and proposed decision, FNS may file with the Hearing Clerk objections thereto. If the ALJ finds that
meritorious objections have been filed, the State agency's motion shall be denied with supporting reasons. If meritorious
objections are not filed, the ALJ shall issue an initial decision without further procedures. Copies of the decision
or denial of State agency's motion shall be served on each of the parties and shall be included as part of the official
record. Where the decision as proposed by the State agency is adopted as the ALJ's initial decision, such decision
of the ALJ shall become final and effective 30 days after service unless reconsideration or review by the Judicial
Officer is sought as discussed in &sect;&sect;283.17(d) and 283.20.

On January 12, 1987, the Ballistic Recovery System, Inc. (BRS), 9242 Hudson Boulevard, Lake Elmo, Minnesota 55042,
filed an application for a supplemental type certificate (STC) to install the GARD&hyph;150 parachute recovery
system on Cessna 150/A150 Series and 152/A152 Model Airplanes. Subsequently, they received the STC under Special
Condition 23&hyph;ACE&hyph;33, dated November 17, 1987. The parachute recovery system is intended to recover an
airplane in emergency situations such as mid-air collision, loss of engine power, loss of airplane control, sever
structural failure, pilot disorientation, or pilot incapacitation with a passenger on board. The GARD&hyph;150
system, which is only used as a last resort, is intended to prevent serious injuries to the airplane occupants by parachuting
the airplane to the ground.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BRS followed their STC on the Cessna 150/A150 and 152/A152 Series with request for special conditions on the General
Aviation Recovery Device (GARD) system that would be applicable to most general aviation airplanes. The nature of
the parachute recovery system applies to most general aviation airplanes with similar configurations and characteristics.
Separate special conditions for each airplane model are not needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parachute recovery systems typically consist of a parachute packed in a canister mounted on the airframe. A solid
propellant rocket motor or compressed air may deploy the canopy and is usually located on the side of the canister.
A door positioned above the canister seals the canister, parachute canopy, and rocket motor from the elements and
provides free exit when the canopy is deployed. These systems are deployed by a mechanical pull handle mounted so that
the pilot and passenger can reach it. At least two separate and independent actions are required to deploy the system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A multicable bridle attaches the canopy bridle to the airplane primary structure. The cable lengths are designed
to provide the best airplane touchdown attitude. The cables are routed externally and covered with small frangible
fairings from the fuselage exist holes to the attach points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicants must supplement the FAA-approved Flight Manual as part of the STC. The supplement will describe the
system, define the operating envelope with appropriate warnings, and define required system maintenance and inspection
information. A separate FAA-approved Operating Manual describing the previous items will be provided for those
airplanes that do not have an FAA-approved Flight Manual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recommended placards should be located near the pull handle in clear view of the pilot to identify the system and operating
envelope, state deployment actions, and provide appropriate warnings. A warning placard should also be located
on the canister near the rocket motor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The installation of parachute recovery systems in part 23, VLA, and primary category airplanes was not envisioned
when the certification basis for these airplanes was established. In addition, the Administrator has determined
that current regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for a parachute recovery system;
therefore, this system is considered a novel and unusual design feature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions may be issued and amended, as necessary, as part of the type certification basis if the Administrator
finds that the airworthiness standards designated in accordance with &sect;21.101(b)(1) do not contain adequate
or appropriate safety standards because of the novel and unusual design features of the airplane modification. Special
conditions, as appropriate, are issued after public notice in accordance with &sect;11.49 (as amended October 25,
1989), as required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b). The special conditions become part of the type certification
basis, as provided by &sect;21.17(a)(2).

Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Notice of Proposed Special Conditions, Docket No. 118CE, Notice No. 23&hyph;ACE&hyph;76 (59 FR 2786, January 19,
1994) proposed special conditions for small general aviation airplanes. The comment period for the notice closed
March 21, 1994. Four comments were received from one commenter. All comments were concerning the flight portion of
these special conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter believes that the wording of the proposed special conditions indicates that flight test may be required
for each make and model of aircraft for which the GARD system will be installed. The commenter does not believe this
is necessary for airplanes with similar characteristics such as configuration, weight, and speed. To support this
position, the commenter cites TSO&hyph;C23c for emergency personnel parachutes that are certified according to
suspended weight and maximum allowable deployment speed. The commenter states that significant configuration
changes would be low wing versus high wing or a change in the position of the parachute main attach point relative to
the aircraft center of gravity. A significant change in airplane characteristics could be defined as any variation
that could potentially cause the airplane to react to parachute deployment different from the original tests.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In this case, a flight demonstration of satisfactory deployment would be required unless a reliable method of analysis
is available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA agrees with the commenter that the wording of the proposal infers that the flight demonstrations are required
for each airplane model receiving the STC. This was not the FAA's original intent with these special conditions. The
FAA agrees with the commenter that the GARD system is intended to add a means of preventing a catastrophic crash when
all other means of recovery are exhausted or made inoperative. To this end, this system adds to the overall safety of
the airplane. Therefore, the FAA agrees with the commenter's approach to different airplanes with similar characteristics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also believes that special condition 1(b)(3) should state: Maneuvering speed with 2g normal load,
not Og normal load. The original flight tests included a 60 degree bank turn with a 2g normal load for one deployment
condition. Essentially, the deployment condition was the airplane turning into the parachute deployment. The test
evaluated both deployment during a turn and the force of the ballistics to eject the parachute away from the airplane
in a way that would allow it to open. The possible concern was not having enough load on the parachute to properly inflate
the canopy. The results on the original GARD&hyph;150 were satisfactory. The FAA's reason for requiring the Og test
was to evaluate additional deployment loads against the airframe limits. In re-evaluating this requirement, the
FAA believes that data from static tests and the stall condition deployment will adequately address the concerns.
Additionally, since the 2g test requirement from the original GARD system was satisfactory, the FAA finds no reason
to evaluate the opening during a 2g turn on each airplane that requires deployment testing. A 2g acceleration is the
same regardless of the type airplane. If the GARD system had the force to fire the parachute away from the airplane while
the airplane was turning toward the parachute, then the results should be the same for other airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter thought that there should be an option of placarding the operating limitations as an alternative to
testing at the never exceed speed 1(b)(i)(4) and in inverted flight for aerobatic aircraft 1(b)(ii). Satisfactory
deployment would be demonstrated at a maximum placarded deployment speed with 1g normal load. This maximum placarded
deployment speed should be greater than or equal to the structural cruising speed of the aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA conducted a thorough evaluation of the first system to be STC'd on a certified airplane. The FAA's interest
with follow-on modifications to similar airplanes is primarily to investigate deployment at the airplane's limits.
It is realistic to expect pilots to deploy this system in an inadvertent spin, at minimum speed (stall), and at the never
exceed speed. By testing at these limits, all conditions in between are covered. The only exception might be high g
loads from aerobatic airplanes. Any situation where the GARD system is deployed will either be 1g or less (i.e., normal
gliding flight through spins), or completely unloaded, or tumbling from a structural failure. It is not reasonable
to expect any applicant to test for the tumbling after a structural failure. In an out-of-control situation (structural
failure), the airplane could quickly reach its never exceed speed. So the requirement to deploy the GARD system at
the never exceed speed will remain. However, since the argument for aerobatic airplane has been presented, including
the operational reality of an inverted deployment, the FAA agrees with the commenter that the merits of requiring
the test are far outweighted by the cost to conduct the test. Therefore, the option of placarding against operating
the GARD system during aerobatics is supported.

Adoption of Special Condition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
issues the following special conditions as part of the supplemental type certification basis for the BRS GARD system
installed in small general aviation airplanes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Flight Test Demonstration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The system must be demonstrated in flight to satisfactorily perform its intended function, without exceeding
the system deployment load factors, for the critical flight conditions, except as allowed in 1(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Satisfactory deployment of the parachute must be demonstrated, at the most critical airplane weight and balance,
for the following flight conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Power off stall with slow entry,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Spin with deployment at one turn,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Never exceed speed with 1g normal load.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Flight demonstrations are not required for airplanes with similar characteristics, (such as configuration,
weight, and speed) to airplanes that have already received an STC for the installation. Only airplanes where a significant
change from airplanes that have already received an STC need to include a flight demonstration. A significant change
in airplane characteristics could be defined as any variation that could potentially cause the airplane to react
to parachute deployment different from original tests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Recently, the FAA received a report from an operator that cracking was found in the lower spar chord of a strut on a Boeing
Model 757 series airplane equipped with a Rolls Royce Model RB211&hyph;535 series engine. This cracking penetrated
through the inboard flange of the chord and propagated into the skin flange of the chord. This fatigue crack in the skin
flange was approximately five inches in length. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Analysis indicates that stiffener straps, which were installed on early production airplanes, increase the likelihood
of cracking in the spar chords. These stiffener straps are no longer installed on later production airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continued operation with the stiffener straps installed will cause fatigue cracking or propagation of existing
cracks in the lower chord. Such cracking could result in the inability of the strut to carry required engine support
loads, and ultimately could lead to separation of the engine from the strut. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;54&hyph;0028, dated March 31, 1994, that describes
procedures for eddy current inspection to detect cracking of the lower spar chord of the engine strut, removal of the
stiffener straps from the mid-chord, open hole eddy current inspection of the fastener holes, and modification.
This modification, which includes installing fasteners, a strut pneumatic duct, a fire extinguisher line, a bulkhead
coverplate, and a panel, will decrease the likelihood of fatigue cracking in the lower spar chord of the engine strut.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Boeing Model 757 series airplanes
of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent cracking of the lower spar chord of the engine strut. This
AD requires eddy current inspection to detect cracking of the lower spar chord of the engine strut, removal of the stiffener
straps from the mid-chord, open hole eddy current inspection of the fastener holes, and modification. The actions
are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. In certain cases,
this AD requires repair of cracking in accordance with an FAA-approved method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;85&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Dassault Aviation Model Mystere-Falcon 50 series airplanes, that requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement of certain attachment clamps installed on the engine exhaust ducts with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improved clamps. This amendment is prompted by reports of failures of certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attachment clamps due to fatigue cracking. The actions specified by this AD are intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent such failures, which could cause exhaust gas to leak and, subsequently, could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trigger a false engine fire alarm.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain Dassault Aviation Model Mystere-Falcon 50 series airplanes was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 22, 1993 (58 FR 61636). That action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed to require replacement of certain attachment clamps installed on the engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust ducts with improved clamps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that paragraph (b) of the rule be revised to indicate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions for verifying that the clamp screw is straight are contained in Dassault 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Service Bulletin F50&hyph;229 (F50&hyph;54&hyph;13), Revision 1, dated July 21, 1993 (which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the service bulletin cited elsewhere in the proposed rule). The commenter notes that those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions indicate that the verification cannot be made if the clamp is installed; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clamp must be removed from the tail pipe attachment in order to determine if it is bent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not. The FAA concurs with the commenter's request and has revised the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 133 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,315, or $55 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicability: Model Mystere-Falcon 50 series airplanes, serial numbers 2 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
216, inclusive; equipped with exhaust duct attachment clamps, part number (P/N) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NH1002299&hyph;10 or P/N NH1007763&hyph;10; certificated in any category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent failure of attachment clamps installed on the engine exhaust ducts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which could cause exhaust gas to leak and, subsequently, could trigger a false engine fire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alarm, accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) For airplanes equipped with exhaust duct attachment clamps having P/N 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NH1002299&hyph;10: Within 300 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, or within 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, replace attachment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clamps having P/N NH1002299&hyph;10 with attachment clamps having P/N NH1007763&hyph;10, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with Dassault Aviation Service Bulletin F50&hyph;229 (F50&hyph;54&hyph;13), Revision 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dated July 21, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For airplanes equipped with exhaust duct attachment clamps having P/N 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NH1007763&hyph;10: Within 1,400 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, inspect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attachment clamps installed on the engine exhaust ducts to verify if the clamp screw is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
straight (not bent), in accordance with Dassault Aviation Service Bulletin F50&hyph;229 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F50&hyph;54&hyph;13), Revision 1, dated July 21, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the clamp screw is straight, prior to further flight, verify if the tightening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
torque value of the screw is marked on the attachment clamp as follows: ``NORMAL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NET TORQUE 100&hyph;120 IN-LBS.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the marking is as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this AD, no further action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the marking is not as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this AD, prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further flight, erase the incorrect marking and replace it with the correct tightening torque

value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) After correcting the marking, prior to further flight, ensure that the clamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screw is secured to the tightening torque value specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the clamp screw is bent, prior to further flight, replace the discrepant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attachment clamp with a new attachment clamp having the same part number, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the Accomplishment Instructions of Dassault Aviation Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F50&hyph;229 (F50&hyph;54&hyph;13), Revision 1, dated July 21, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) As of the effective date of this AD, no person shall install an exhaust duct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attachment clamp having P/N NH1007763&hyph;10 on any airplane, unless that attachment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clamp is marked ``NORMAL NET TORQUE 100&hyph;120 IN-LBS.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action establishes Class E5 airspace at Griffith, Indiana, to accommodate a new VOR/DME Runway 26 Standard Instrument
Approach Procedure (SIAP) to Griffith-Merrillville Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 to
1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The intended effect of this action
is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from other
aircraft operating in visual weather conditions.

History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 2, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Griffith, Indiana, to accommodate a new VOR/DME Runway 26 SIAP to Griffith-Merrillville Airport (59
FR 22571). The proposal was to add controlled airspace extending from 700 feet to 1200 feet AGL for Instrument Flight
Rules (IFR) operations in controlled airspace during portions of the terminal operation and while transiting between
the enroute and terminal environments. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding
by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Griffith, Indiana,
to accommodate a new VOR/DME Runway 26 SIAP to Griffith-Merrillville Airport. Controlled airspace extending from
700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed for aircraft executing the approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in
order to comply with applicable visual flight rule requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 21, 1994, the FAA published a final rule amending the regulations for emergency locator transmitters (ELT's)
(59 FR 32050). As discussed in the preamble to that final rule, the FAA intended to include in the language of &sect;91.207
a date after which ELT's that meet Technical Standard Order (TSO) C91 could no longer be installed in aircraft. That
language was inadvertently omitted from the amendment to Section 91.207. This document presents only the omitted
rule language for paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of &sect;91.207.

 This rule brings up to date the Department's existing regulations relating to administrative claims to reflect current
statutory authority for federal agencies to compromise, terminate or suspend collection activities on claims of
the Government up to $100,000 without prior approval from the Department of Justice. The existing regulation limits
such collection activities to debts up to $20,000. The rule also makes two other technical amendments_one relating
to the assessment of interest on claims due to the Department and one relating to the distribution of certain final
decisions on indebtedness made by HUD Deputy Assistant Secretaries.

(or to suspend or end collection action) on a claim of the Government of not more than $100,000 (excluding interest)
or such higher amount as the Attorney General may from time to time prescribe provided that the claim has not been referred
to another executive or legislative agency for further collection action. Prior to amendment of this section by the
Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;552, 104 Stat. 2736, Approved November 15, 1990) this authority
of agencies to compromise, or to suspend or end collection actions on government claims was limited to claims of $20,000
or less.

Existing HUD regulations (24 CFR Part 17 (Administrative Claims) contain a number of provisions setting forth the
now out of date dollar threshold of $20,000 rather than the $100,000 threshold which the statute (31 U.S.C. 3711(a))
currently authorizes. This rule updates HUD regulations (Subpart C of 24 CFR Part 17_Procedures for the Collection
of Claims by the Government) to reflect the new $100,000 statutory threshold.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations_17 CFR 17.72(e)_provide for assessment of interest on claims due the Department at 7 percent.
This rule revises this provision to provide for the assessment of interest at the Treasury rate in effect when the demand
for payment is made, as provided in the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Debt Collection Act
of 1982, and in the joint regulations of the Attorney General and Comptroller General at 4 CFR Parts 101&hyph;105 (joint
regulations).

When a debt is paid in installments and interest is collected, installment payments will first be applied to the payment
of accrued interest and then to principal in accordance with the so-called ``U.S. Rule'' unless a different rule is
prescribed by statute, contract or regulation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Debt Collection Act of 1982 specifically provides for the assessment of interest and, in 1984, the joint regulations
were amended to reflect the provisions of that Act. Reference to the ``U.S. Rule'' was properly deleted from the amended
joint regulations and a reference to 31 U.S.C. 3717, the statutory provision authorizing agencies to assess interest
on debts, was substituted. In this rule, as was done in the amended joint regulations, the obsolete reference to the
so called ``U.S. Rule'' is deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in 24 CFR 17.110, a section relating to final decisions on amounts of indebtedness made by HUD Deputy Assistant
Secretaries or their designees, paragraph (b) providing that copies of the final decisions will be distributed to
the General Counsel, the Office of Finance and Accounting, and the debtors (or their attorneys or representatives
if applicable) is revised so that it only provides for copies to debtors (or their attorneys or representatives, if
applicable). The change reflects HUD policy that any provisions relating to distribution of documents within the
Department should not be included in a regulation designed to inform the public of its rights and obligations. Such
provisions are more appropriate in a handbook or other internal HUD directive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the strictly technical nature of this rule, and the fact that the statutory provisions involved are, at any rate,
self enforcing, the Department has determined that notice and public comment procedure under Title 5 of the United
States Code is unnecessary and is therefore issuing this document as a final rule.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the Secretary has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This rule is technical in nature. It effects no substantive changes in HUD programs or policies.

This subpart sets forth the regulations of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development implementing the Federal
Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Federal Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.) (the Act),
in conformity with the standards jointly promulgated by the Attorney General and the Comptroller General in 4 CFR
parts 101 through 105. The Act: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Requires the Secretary or his designee to attempt collection of all claims of the United States for money or property
arising out of the activities of the Department; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Authorizes the Secretary or his designee to compromise claims that have not been referred to another executive
or legislative agency for further collection action where the claim does not exceed $100,000 exclusive of interest,
or to suspend or terminate collection action where it appears that no person liable on the claim has the present or prospective
financial ability to pay any significant sum thereon or that the cost of collecting the claim is likely to exceed the
amount of recovery.

Subdivision and joining of claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A debtor's liability arising from a particular transaction or contract shall be considered as a single claim in
determining whether the claim is one not exceeding $100,000 exclusive of interest for the purpose of compromise or
termination of collection action. Such a claim may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary ceiling established by
the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Joining of two or more single claims in a demand upon a particular debtor for payment totaling more than $100,000
does not preclude compromise or termination of collection action with respect to any one of such claims that does not
exceed $100,000 exclusive of interest.

except as provided in &sect;17.65 and paragraph (b) of this section. When initial attempts at collection by the office
having responsibility for such claims have not been fully successful, the claim file shall be forwarded to the Assistant
Secretary for Administration for further administrative collection procedures. Claims shall be referred to the
Assistant Secretary for Administration well within the applicable statute of limitations (28 U.S.C. 2415 and 2416),
but in no event more than 2 years after the claims accrued.

Interest. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where prejudgment interest is not mandated by statute, contract or regulation, the minimum rate of interest to be
charged on delinquent debts is the Tax and Loan Account Rate for the U.S. Treasury (also known as the Current Value of
Funds rate) as prescribed and published semiannually by the Secretary of the Treasury in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. Prejudgment interest may be waived as an inducement to voluntary payment. In such
cases demand letters should inform the debtor that prejudgment interest will be collected if suit becomes necessary.
When a debt is paid in installments and interest is collected, installment payments will first be applied to the payment
of accrued interest and then to principal unless a different rule is prescribed by statute, contract or regulation.
Prejudgment interest shall not be demanded or collected on civil penalty and forfeiture claim unless the statute
under which the claim arises authorizes the collection of such interest.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has received several requests to extend the effective date of paragraph (d), hazard assessment, and paragraph
(f), training. It is contended that many employers will not be able to complete the required hazard assessment and
training before the effective date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has also received petitions from the American Forest &amp; Paper Association (AF&amp;PA), the American Iron
and Steel Institute (AISI), and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association (CMA) to delay the effective date of the
provisions for hazard assessment and training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been asserted that a worksite hazard assessment, where not previously performed, could be a major undertaking.
Also, longer periods of time may be necessary if an employer determines that there is a need for task-specific assessments
or training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in its petition to the Agency, AISI stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In some cases, employers may determine that there is a need for task-specific hazard assessments or training. As the
compliance effort moves along the continuum from generic toward task-specific, a substantially longer period of
time would be required to comply with the final rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has also been asserted that it would take a substantial amount of time to develop and implement the type of training
program that is envisioned by the final rule. Even where training programs do exist, some may not meet all of the requirements
of the final rule, and employers would not be able to implement changes to these programs before the effective date.
In its petition to OSHA, AF&amp;PA remarked:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
While some employers may have performed the required hazard assessments and provided the required training, they
may not be fully comfortable certifying that their employees have the necessary knowledge and abilities with respect
to PPE without some form of verification. Some employers may find gaps or weak points in their existing PPE programs.
Other employers will find that their existing PPE programs are so informal that they will conclude they must begin
from ``ground zero.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After evaluating these comments, OSHA has decided that it is reasonable to allow an additional amount of time for employers
to meet the requirements pertaining to the hazard assessment (&sect;1910.132(d)) and training (&sect;1910.132(f)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Agency is granting an administrative stay of the effective date for paragraphs (d) and (f) of &sect;1910.132
until October 5, 1994 to allow employers an additional amount of time to achieve compliance with these two paragraphs.
OSHA expects that employers will continue to expedite their efforts to fully comply with all of the provisions of the
standard. It is also important to note that the effective date for all of the other provisions of the final rule remains
July 5, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This subpart establishes restrictions governing the operation of unauthorized vehicles, motorized and non-motorized,
on the army training areas of Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, as defined in &sect;552.134 of this subpart. Unauthorized
vehicles are restricted to paved roads on the installation of Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) These restrictions are established to prevent the interruption of the use of these Army training areas by any person

be dangerous to unauthorized persons entering these areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In addition, these restrictions have been established to prevent property damage, threatening of endangered
flora and fauna in the areas, and to prevent the harassment of protected species such as the Blue Heron and the Indiana
Bat by any person or persons.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This order revokes a Secretarial order, as modified, insofar as it affects 80.13 acres of public land withdrawn for
Air Navigation Site No. 136 at Thompson Pass. The land is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was withdrawn.
This action also modifies a public land order to allow the State of Alaska's existing application for selection to
attach, and classifies the land as suitable for conveyance of the land to the State, if such land is otherwise available.
If not conveyed to the State, the land will continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of Public Land Order No.
5150, as amended, and any other withdrawal of record. This order does not otherwise change the provisions or limitations
of Public Land Order No. 5150, as amended, or any other withdrawal of record.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS announces an adjustment of the ending date of the annual closure of the shrimp fishery in the exclusive economic
zone (EEZ) off Texas. The closure normally ends on July 15 each year. Because biological data indicate that brown shrimp
leaving the Texas estuaries will have reached the desired size by July 7, 1994, the ending date is changed to this earlier
date. The Texas closure is intended to prohibit the harvest of brown shrimp during their major period of emigration
from Texas estuaries to the Gulf of Mexico so the shrimp may reach a larger, more valuable size and to prevent the waste
of brown shrimp that would be discarded in fishing operations because of their small size.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of
Mexico (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and is implemented by regulations
at 50 CFR part 658 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

.). The FMP's implementing regulations at 50 CFR 658.25 describe the Texas closure and provide for adjustments to
the beginning and ending dates by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, under specified criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Available information meeting the criteria specified at 50 CFR 658.25(b)(1) indicates that an early ending of the
Texas closure is warranted and desirable. Biological data collected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department indicate
that ending the closure on July 7, 1994, will provide adequate protection of small brown shrimp emigrating from the
Texas estuaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the time and date at 50 CFR 658.25(a) for ending the Texas closure is changed from 30 minutes after sunset,
July 15, 1994, to 30 minutes after sunset on July 7, 1994. During the closure, the area described at 50 CFR 658.25(a)
is closed to all trawl fishing, except that a vessel may fish for royal red shrimp beyond the 100&hyph;fathom (183&hyph;m)
depth contour. The waters of Texas are also closed during this period.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Atka mackerel TAC for the CAD was established by the final 1994 initial
specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 37,846 metric tons (mt). The directed fishery for
Atka mackerel was closed on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29964, June 10, 1994). NMFS has determined that as of June 11, 1994, 2,201
mt remain unharvested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the 1994 TAC for Atka mackerel in the CAD has not been reached.
Therefore, NMFS is rescinding the June 7, 1994, closure and is reopening directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the
CAD, effective at 12 noon, A.l.t., July 4, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FHWA is amending the requirements for warning devices for stopped commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) to allow the
use of fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles, unless the CMV is transporting
certain hazardous materials or is powered by compressed gas. It is the intent of this final rule to give equal priority
to fusees and liquid-burning flares with regard to use as emergency warning devices. This action is required by the
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.

Section 1041(b) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240,
105 Stat. 1914, 1993), signed by the President on December 18, 1991, requires that ``Section 393.95 of title 49 of the
Code of Federal Regulations shall be applied so that fusees and flares are given equal priority with regard to use as
reflecting signs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 14, 1993, the FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend &sect;393.95 to allow commercial
motor vehicles to be equipped with fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles,
except CMVs transporting explosives (Division 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 hazardous materials), cargo tank motor vehicles
used for flammable and combustible liquids (Class 3 hazardous materials) or flammable gas (Division 2.1 hazardous
materials) (whether loaded or empty), or motor vehicles using compressed gas as a motor fuel. The FHWA also proposed
amending &sect;392.22(b), which sets forth requirements for the placement and use of warning devices for stopped
vehicles, because paragraph (b) did not allow the use of fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional
reflective triangles.

The FHWA proposed that vehicles be equipped with either (1) three bidirectional reflective triangles or (2) six fusees
or liquid-burning flares. With regard to performance standards for fusees and liquid-burning flares, the FHWA proposed
to amend &sect;393.95(j) to require that these devices be capable of burning for at least 30 minutes, and meet the standards
of the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., Highway Emergency Signals (UL 912).

Discussion of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA received 12 comments to the NPRM. The commenters were: 3M; Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates);
the American Trucking Associations (ATA); Chemical Waste Transportation Institute (CWTI); Cortina Tool and Molding
Company; James King and Company, Inc.; Federal Mogul; National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc.; Ohio University, College
of Engineering and Technology, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering; Pyrotechnic Signal Manufacturers
Association (PSMA); Sate-Lite Manufacturing Company (Sate-Lite); and the Transportation Safety Equipment Institute
(TSEI). The commenters were generally opposed to allowing the use of fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional
reflective triangles. The CWTI did not support or oppose the proposal but indicated that the FHWA should retain its
restrictions on flame producing devices on certain vehicles and recommended that the FHWA use this rulemaking to
amend &sect;393.95(g) to incorporate the use of the current hazardous materials classifications (i.e., Divisions
1.1, 1.2, or 1.3, 2.1 and Class 3). The PSMA provided the only comments in support of the proposed amendments.

Interpretation of Section 1041(b) of the ISTEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several of the commenters questioned the FHWA's interpretation of section 1041(b) of the ISTEA. Sate-Lite believes
that section 1041(b) is ambiguous and as such the FHWA has great latitude in the implementation of the requirement.
Sate-Lite stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By explicitly acknowledging the safety hazards associated with fusees and flares and by specifically addressing
these hazards by prohibiting the use of fusees and flares in certain situations, the FHWA has recognized that ISTEA
granted the FHWA broad discretion in implementing Section 1041(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clearly Congress did not anticipate or intend to require that the FHWA sacrifice motorist safety and the security
of our federal highway system on the altar of ``equal priority.'' As the FHWA has recognized, on these issues of motorist
safety, Congress must defer to the expertise and judgment of the FHWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the dangers and manifest deficiencies inherent in the use of fusees and flares as a substitute for warning
triangles *&blank;*&blank;* Sate-Lite respectfully urges the FHWA to exercise its discretion by amending the proposed
rule change. Sate-Lite strongly believes that the FHWA should continue to require motor carriers to carry three emergency
warning triangles in accordance with the current rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its comments, the ATA stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language of Section 1041(b) of the [ISTEA] strongly suggests that its sponsor(s) believe[s] that a fusee and a
liquid-burning flare are essentially similar&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*. It should be made clear that fusees are
acceptable only as a short-term warning device for use while long-term warning devices are put in place. In addition,
it should be made clear that the trucking industry abandoned the use of liquid-burning flares (pot torches) as soon
as the use of a superior type of warning device (the ``dot-over-dot'' emergency reflectors) was authorized by federal
and state regulators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons outline[d] above, liquid-burning flares have not been manufactured for 30 years, or more. In our view,
the current effort to encourage a return to their use by the motor carrier industry is a step backward. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocates did not believe that the ISTEA prohibits the FHWA from continuing to require that each CMV be equipped with
three bidirectional reflective triangles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA believes that section 1041(b) of ISTEA requires that fusees and liquid-burning flares be allowed, but not
mandated, in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles. The FHWA already allows the use of fusees and other warning
devices in addition to reflective triangles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the ATA's comments about liquid-burning flares, or ``pot torches,'' the ISTEA refers to ``fusees and
flares.'' The FHWA believes the term ``fusee'' refers to a solid material that is ignited by friction and the term ``flare''
refers to a liquid-burning warning device. These terms, as used in the ISTEA, are not interchangeable. As such, the
ISTEA allows the use of fusees and liquid-burning flares as primary emergency warning devices. While the apparent
lack of availability of liquid-burning flares, as indicated by the ATA, might preclude their use as an alternative
to bidirectional reflective triangles, the requirement of the ISTEA is not contingent upon the availability of the
warning device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the Advocates' concerns, the FHWA does not believe it would be appropriate to require all CMVs to carry
bidirectional reflective triangles. For those cases in which the CMV is equipped only with fusees or liquid-burning
flares, the NPRM proposed, and this final rule includes, an amendment to &sect;392.22 stating that there shall be
at least one lighted fusee or liquid-burning flare at each of the locations specified in &sect;392.22(b)(1) for the
entire period that the vehicle is stopped. If a motor carrier chooses to rely solely upon fusees or liquid-burning
flares as emergency warning devices, the motor carrier should not be penalized by being forced to carry an additional
warning device that, under these circumstances, it would not be required to use.

Effectiveness of Fusees and Liquid-Burning Flares Versus Triangles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of the commenters opposed the use of fusees in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles because of concerns
about the effectiveness of fusees as emergency warning devices. The Advocates stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unfortunately, the elevation of fusees and liquid-burning flares to the status of primary warning devices alongside
triangles is a regressive step that can have serious consequences in the potential for additional truck and bus accidents.
Although there are major shortcomings with the design and performance of reflective triangles, and with the criteria
for deploying them set forth in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR), the selection of a single device
having priority in all circumstances appropriately fulfills the well-known principle of traffic engineering that
motorists should always be reinforced in their traffic control expectations when negotiating roads and streets.
That is, it is important to educate motorists to the unambiguous intent of traffic control devices by ensuring the
use of designs with unvarying shapes, sizes, colors, and messages. Despite the fact that Advocates has serious misgivings
over the retroreflective performance and conspicuity of emergency triangles, there is little question that their
consistent use over the past two decades has provided instant recognition by motorists that there is a disabled commercial
vehicle on or near the travelway. This important recognition by motorists can now be threatened by the substitution
of flares or fusees to demarcate the area around a disabled truck or bus.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Study cites the fact that triangles can be placed as far away from the vehicle as needed and the fact that they do not require
electric power. Moreover, flares and fusees: (1) Flares do not command attention because ``their light comes from
one small source and isn't very conspicuous at a distance''; (2) a flare's light may not last until help arrives; (3)
there is the obvious need for periodic replacement of flares; and (4) flares will frequently roll or blow away from
their initial site. These problems and deficiencies should be obvious even to the casual observer of highway conditions.
The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

study concluded that ``Triangles provided the clearest warning from 100 feet at night.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters also referred to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report entitled ``Study of Safety-Related
Devices_Emergency Warning Devices for Disabled Vehicles'' (August 19, 1986) (NHTSA Report) to support their claims
that bidirectional reflective triangles are more effective than fusees as emergency warning devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the FHWA understands the concerns of the commenters, it notes that this rulemaking is in response to section
1041(b) of the ISTEA. Section 1041(b) requires that &sect;393.95 be applied so that fusees and liquid-burning flares
are given ``equal priority'' with bidirectional reflective triangles as emergency warning devices. The congressional
mandate is not contingent upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of fusees and liquid-burning flares relative to
that of bidirectional reflective triangles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this rulemaking is not intended to require the use of fusees and liquid-burning flares, but rather to
allow their use as a primary emergency warning device on certain CMVs. This final rule does not require motor carriers
to discontinue the use of bidirectional reflective triangles in favor of warning devices they believe to be less effective.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM requested comments on whether or not motor carriers should be allowed to use a mixture of fusees, liquid-burning
flares, and bidirectional reflective triangles (e.g., a bidirectional triangle at one of the three locations warning
devices are required to be deployed, and fusees at the other locations). Sate-Lite and the TSEI believed that allowing
a mixture of warning devices would contribute to motorist confusion and uncertainty in associating the warning devices
with the stopped CMV.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA agrees with the commenters concerns about motorist ability to understand the warning devices. The FHWA believes
that the effectiveness of the three warning devices placed around the stopped vehicle would be diminished by allowing
a different type of device to be used at each location. Therefore, &sect;392.22 is being amended to require that the
same type(s) of warning devices be used at each of the locations specified in &sect;392.22.

Minimum Number of Fusees and Flares Required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA proposed that CMVs equipped with only fusees or liquid-burning flares have a minimum of six of these warning
devices at all times. The ATA believed the proposed minimum was unrealistic. The ATA believed that the one hour of protection
provided by six 30-minute fusees would not be sufficient based on what they considered the ``best available information''
on the duration of CMV breakdown time under ``optimum'' conditions. The ATA also pointed out that UL 912 specifies
that each liquid-burning flare be capable of burning for 12 hours and that three of these devices should be sufficient.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA believes that a requirement for six fusees is appropriate. As stated in the NHTSA Report: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Roughly one-half of all emergency stops and disabled vehicle situations last for more than 30 minutes *&blank;*&blank;*.
Moreover, since the distribution of emergency stop durations is highly positively skewed, the total disabled vehicle
exposure time for the time period of more than 30 minutes is considerably greater than for the time period of less than
30 minutes. No statistics are available to compare the ``total risk'' incurred after 30 minutes to that incurred before
30 minutes, but presumably the risk per minute is greatest soon after the emergency stop *&blank;*&blank;*. However,
the total exposure time of disabled vehicles is greater after 30 minutes due to those vehicles left for several hours
or more. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA recognizes that a number of factors affect the amount of time a vehicle remains disabled, including its location
(e.g., urban area versus a rural area) and the availability of maintenance personnel and equipment. The FHWA believes
that the performance-based requirement that warning devices be in place for the entire period the vehicle is stopped
adequately addresses this issue. Motor carriers are responsible for ensuring that a sufficient number of warning
devices are provided on their CMVs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the ATA's comments about liquid-burning flares, the FHWA agrees that the proposed requirement for
six liquid-burning flares was inconsistent with the UL 912 performance criteria which was proposed for incorporation
by reference. Because UL 912 requires that liquid-burning flares be capable of burning for 12 hours, requiring three
liquid-burning flares for vehicles which are not equipped with fusees or bidirectional reflective triangles is
sufficient.

Incorporation by Reference of UL 912 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM included a proposal that fusees and liquid-burning flares meet UL 912. In the case of fusees, UL 912 would be
used to replace the &sect;393.95(j) reference to the Association of American Railroads (AAR), ``Specifications
for Red Railway or Red Highway Fuses.'' The ATA and the PSMA were the only commenters that addressed this issue. The
ATA believed the FHWA should allow the use of fusees meeting either UL 912 or the AAR standards. The PSMA believed the
performance standards of UL 912 are appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA has reviewed the UL and AAR standards. The two documents have comparable performance criteria for fusees.
However, the UL document provides performance criteria for both fusees and liquid-burning flares while the AAR document
only covers fusees. The FHWA has concluded the UL document is appropriate for incorporation by reference because
the ISTEA requires that both fusees and liquid-burning flares be allowed for use as emergency warning devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the requirements contained in UL 912, the PSMA suggested that all fusees be of the ``lay-down type''
with a ``no-roll device.'' The PSMA did not provide any discussion of this suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A requirement that all fusees be of the ``lay-down type'' is unnecessarily design restrictive in that it would prohibit,
without technical justification, the use of fusees that are provided with a means to remain in an upright position.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to a ``no-roll device,'' motor carriers must ensure that warning devices are in place at the required locations.
If certain devices are necessary to keep fusees in place, the motor carrier is responsible for providing them. Furthermore,
a general requirement for a ``no-roll device'' would not provide objective criteria as to what constitutes an acceptable
device. The FHWA has not adopted the PSMA's suggestions.

The FHWA is amending &sect;393.95 to allow CMVs to be equipped with fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional
reflective triangles, except CMVs transporting Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 hazardous materials (explosives), cargo
tank motor vehicles used for Class 3 (flammable and combustible liquid) or Division 2.1 (flammable gas) hazardous
materials (whether loaded or empty), or motor vehicles using compressed gas as a motor fuel. This prohibition is necessary
to minimize the risk of explosion or catastrophic fire involving cargoes and fuels of these types. The FHWA believes
the retention of this provision is consistent with congressional intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule amends &sect;393.95(f)(2) to require that CMVs be equipped with either (1) three bidirectional reflective
triangles, (2) six fusees (each capable of burning for 30 minutes), or (3) three liquid-burning flares (filled with
a sufficient amount of fuel to burn continuously for at least one hour). Although the FHWA has specified a minimum number
of fusees and liquid burning flares, motor carriers relying solely upon these devices are responsible for ensuring
that fusees or liquid-burning flares are in use for the entire time the vehicle is stopped upon the traveled portion
of a highway or the shoulder of a highway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is amending &sect;392.22(b)(1) to require that the same type(s) of warning devices be used at each of the locations
where warning devices are placed around the CMV. Section 392.22(b)(2)(i)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fusees and liquid-burning flares

, is being amended to require that motor carriers relying solely upon fusees or liquid-burning flares ensure that
those devices are in use for the entire time the vehicle is stopped upon the traveled portion of a highway or the shoulder
of a highway. The driver of the vehicle is required to extinguish and remove each fusee or liquid-burning flare before
the stopped vehicle is moved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the FHWA is amending &sect;392.22(b)(2)(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Daylight hours
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to allow motor carriers to use fusees or liquid-burning flares in lieu of bidirectional reflective triangles when
their CMVs are stopped during daylight hours in business or residential districts. Section 392.22(b)(2)(ii) requires
that if fusees or liquid-burning flares are used, there must be at least one lighted fusee or flare at each of the prescribed
locations as long as the vehicle is stopped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is removing &sect;392.22(b)(2)(vii) Exemption for lightweight vehicles, and certain United States Code
and CFR citations at the end of &sect;392.22. Although the NPRM did not address these issues, the amendments are considered
administrative in nature.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 19, 1988 (53 FR 18042), the FHWA published a final rule implementing the requirements of the Motor Carrier Act
of 1984. The May 19, 1988, final rule included a definition of commercial motor vehicle which with certain exceptions,
excluded lightweight vehicles (vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less) from the applicability
of the FMCSRs. Therefore, the vehicles for which paragraph (b)(2)(vii) was intended are generally not subject to
the FMCSRs and paragraph (b)(2)(vii) is obsolete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to performance standards for fusees and liquid-burning flares, the FHWA is amending &sect;393.95(j)
to require that both fusees and liquid-burning flares meet the standards of the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc.,
Highway Emergency Signals (UL 912). The final rule incorporates by reference UL 912 in &sect;393.95.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA has created a new section, &sect;393.7, Matter incorporated by reference, to provide the language of incorporation
required by 1 CFR 51 and to provide information on the availability of the incorporated document. After a review of
the comments to the July 14, 1993, NPRM and a determination that the incorporation by reference was necessary for the
final rule, the FHWA submitted UL 912 to the Director of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for approval in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 522(a) and 1 CFR 51.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA recognizes that some motor carriers may wish to supplement the required warning devices (reflective triangles
or fusees and flares) with other warning devices such as electric lanterns. The final rule allows the use of other warning
devices in addition to, but not in lieu of, the required devices provided they do not decrease the effectiveness of
the required devices. The FHWA has added &sect;393.95(f)(3) to clearly indicate this intent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule amends the requirements for warning devices for stopped vehicles. The FHWA has determined that this
is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or significant within the meaning
of the Department of Transportation policies and procedures. It is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking
will be minimal. This final rule allows motor carriers the option to use fusees and liquid-burning flares in lieu of
bidirectional reflective triangles. The rule does not increase the cost of complying with the requirements for emergency
warning devices on commercial motor vehicles. Therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In their comments to the docket, both Sate-Lite and the TSEI expressed concern that the proposed regulation would
have adverse impacts on small manufacturers of bidirectional reflective triangles and small motor carriers electing
to deploy fusees or liquid-burning flares in accordance with this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these concerns, and in compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA
has evaluated the effects of this rulemaking on small entities. As for small manufacturers of bidirectional reflective
triangles, the final rule does not prohibit or restrict the manufacture, sale, or use of such devices. Furthermore,
this final rule does not require motor carriers to increase the number and types of warning devices carried on their
CMVs. Nor does the rule mandate that CMVs be equipped with only one type of warning device. Rather the rule fulfills
the requirements of section 1041(b) of the ISTEA by simply allowing, with few exceptions, the use of fusees and liquid-burning
flares as an alternative to bidirectional reflective triangles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its evaluation of this rulemaking, the FHWA certifies that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,

of a Federalism Assessment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FHWA is amending the cargo securement requirements of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs)
to adopt the use of working load limits in specifying the minimum strength of cargo securement devices. The amendment
requires that the aggregate working load limit of the tiedown assemblies used to secure an article against movement
in any direction be at least
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1/2 times the weight of the article secured. In addition, a table of working load limits is being included in the FMCSRs
to provide motor carriers with a means of determining the number of tiedown assemblies required. It is the intent of
this final rule to make the tiedown requirements easier to understand, use, and enforce. This action is in response
to a petition from the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA).

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 29, 1990, the CVSA petitioned the FHWA to change the criterion for cargo tiedown assemblies from ``static
breaking strength'' to ``working load limit.'' The CVSA contends the static breaking strength of a tiedown assembly
is a rating that incorporates no safety factor, though the rule itself does include such a factor. The CVSA also believes
the use of working load limits will make the tiedown regulations easier to understand, use, and enforce. The petitioner
asserts that working load limit is the strength criterion commonly used by the chain, cordage, wire rope, and web sling
industries and that the term is widely known in the trucking industry. The use of the working load limits would thus
promote direct correlation between the rule and the capabilities labeled on or indicated by load securement equipment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CVSA proposed that the first sentence of &sect;393.102(b) be amended to read ``Except for integral securement
devices *&blank;*&blank;* the aggregate working load limit of the tiedown assemblies used to secure an article against
movement in any direction must be at least 1/2 times the weight of that article.'' The CVSA also proposed that chain,
webbing, wire rope, and cordage meet certain manufacturing specifications or standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 17, 1993, the FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) (58 FR 48624) to adopt the use of working
load limits and the incorporation by reference of chain, webbing, wire rope, and cordage manufacturing standards.
Although the CVSA petition did not discuss standards for steel strapping, the FHWA proposed that Federal Specification
No. A&hyph;A&hyph;880, Strapping, Steel Flat and Seals (May 13, 1980), be incorporated by reference because &sect;393.102
had referenced Federal Specification No. QQ&hyph;S&hyph;781 which has been cancelled. The FHWA believed it was
necessary to retain specific requirements for steel strapping and that Federal Specification No. A&hyph;A&hyph;880
was an appropriate replacement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA also proposed to create a new section, &sect;393.7, Matter incorporated by reference, to provide the language
of incorporation required by 1 CFR 51, as well as to include information on the availability of documents incorporated
by reference.

The FHWA received 23 comments to the NPRM. Several commenters provided more than one docket submission. The commenters
were: Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates); American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA); Department
of California Highway Patrol (CHP); Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA); Connecticut Department of Motor
Vehicles (Connecticut); Cooper Tools; The Cordage Institute; The Crosby Group, Inc.; Great American Lines, Inc.;
Illinois Department of Transportation (Illinois); Kinedyne Corporation; Maine State Police (Maine); The National
Industrial Transportation League; New York Department of Transportation (New York); Owner-Operator Independent
Drivers Association, Inc. (OOIDA); United States Representative Jack Quinn, 30th District, New York; Steel Service

Use of Working Load Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters were generally in favor of amending &sect;393.102(b) to incorporate the use of working load limits.
The CHP and Great American Lines were both opposed to the use of working load limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CHP stated:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
[Static breaking strength (SBS)] is a readily determined physical parameter. Conversely, the WLL, according to
the NPRM is generally between 1/4 and 1/3 of the static breaking strength of the tiedown. The CHP is not aware of any regulation
which defines WLL. Instead, each manufacturer makes this determination for its own products. In many cases this may
be based on industry standard practice, but since these practices are voluntary, no means is available to assure conformance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In effect, the FHWA is abdicating its responsibility to determine proper tiedown standards by allowing manufacturers
to determine the WLL of their devices. It is the opinion of the CHP that this parameter is far too critical to leave to
a manufacturer's discretion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless the WLL for each type of binder is defined in the regulation, there will always be some ambiguity as to the strength
of the device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, from an enforcement perspective, the WLL method could result in a hardship since WLL, based only on a factor
determined by each manufacturer, is a much harder concept for enforcement/prosecution personnel to explain in court
as opposed to the SBS, a parameter which is nearly intuitively obvious. Variations from manufacturer to manufacturer
will further complicate the issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Great American Lines, Inc., stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[T]he current regulations as written in []&sect;393.102 [of the] FMCS[Rs] are more than sufficient. Properly trained
drivers using the securement as specified in the current regulations will have no problem keeping the cargo on the
trailer. Education is the key, not change. The changes as proposed can only confuse the drivers, carriers and enforcement
officers and cause an extremely dangerous situation *&blank;*&blank;*. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing to the C.V.S.A. guidelines can serve no good purpose and will confuse the people that it is meant to regulate.
In the end the public will suffer. Don't change something that is working when properly applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its second docket submission, Great American Lines, Inc., stated that ``Neither the reasons presented in the text
of the proposal nor at the congressional hearings preceding this notice of proposed rulemaking establish a problem
with the regulation that warrant the changes being proposed.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TTMA's position on the issue was contingent upon the FHWA's clarification of the term ``tiedown assemblies.''
The TTMA stated: ``If the term `tiedown assemblies,' as used in []&sect;393.102(b) includes trailer anchor points,
then we object to changing `breaking strength' to `working load limit.''' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is true, as the CHP noted, that working load limits are based on each manufacturer's determination. That is also
true for static breaking strength, however, and neither value can be tested during roadside enforcement. The FHWA
notes that the terms ``static breaking strength'' and ``working load limit'' are defined in numerous technical dictionaries,
manuals, and reference books. While each manufacturer makes a determination of the working load limits of its own
products, the documents incorporated by reference, combined with certain other requirements in &sect;393.102,
eliminate the risk of voluntary or purely subjective standards. By incorporating by reference certain manufacturing
standards, this rulemaking establishes specific minimum strength requirements for five categories of securement
devices: steel strapping, chains, wire rope, cordage, and synthetic webbing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA does not believe that tiedown manufacturers will produce devices which fail to meet these minimum strength
requirements. For those cases in which the manufacturing standards do not provide specific working load limits (e.g.,
the document lists breaking strength or a working load limit range), the final rule establishes the procedure for
determining this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the final rule includes a table of working load limits for some of the most commonly used types and sizes
of tiedowns. The rule requires that the working load limits listed in the table be used when the tiedown material is
not marked with its working load limit. The values listed in the table are based on the industry standards referenced
in &sect;393.102. Therefore, the uncertainty about the strength of a tiedown is limited to tiedowns which do not meet
the manufacturing standards, and the rule prohibits the use of such tiedowns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the CHP's comments about possible difficulties in the enforcement of a working load limit requirement, it is
clear that the CVSA, whose membership includes State officials charged with enforcement, considered this issue
before petitioning the FHWA. Section 393.102 specifies the relationship between the strength rating of the tiedown
devices and the weight of the article being secured. If the strength rating and weight of the article are known, and
the relationship between the two is clearly stated in &sect;393.102, the inspecting official should not have to provide
an engineering discussion or justification of the strength rating requirement. Furthermore, as the CVSA indicated
in its petition, and as several tiedown manufacturers, manufacturers' associations, and enforcement agencies
have stated in their comments in response to the NPRM, a working load limit requirement would be easier to understand,
use, and enforce because tiedown manufacturers prefer to label their products with the working load limit as opposed
to the static breaking strength. The manufacturers believe the use of working load limits would decrease the likelihood
of accidental misuse or overloading of the tiedowns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA agrees with Great American Lines' emphasis on training and education. However, the number of accidents involving
inadequately secured cargo suggests that some motor carriers do not understand or observe the current regulations.
It must be noted that static breaking strength has been in use for approximately 20 years. During this time, education
and training have played a role in reducing the number of cargo securement-related accidents to a relatively low level.
The final rule is intended to make the cargo securement regulations easier to understand, use, and enforce in order
to further reduce the incidence of cargo securement-related accidents.

The TTMA asked whether the term ``tiedown assemblies'' in the current regulations includes trailer anchor points.
The answer is technically no, but the anchor points have to meet the same standard. Section 393.102(d) requires that
the hook, bolt, weld, or other connections by which a tiedown assembly is attached to a vehicle, and the mounting place
and means of mounting the connector, be at least as strong as the tiedown assembly. The final rule does not reference
any manufacturing standards or recommended practices for trailer anchor points nor does it require trailer manufacturers
to change their current practices regarding anchor points. However, the FHWA encourages trailer manufacturers
to provide information to motor carriers and enforcement officials about the strength of anchor points to improve
their knowledge of the cargo restraint capabilities of anchor points.

Incorporation by Reference and the Table of Working Load Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, the commenters supported the inclusion of the table of working load limits in &sect;393.102 and the incorporation
by reference of certain industry standards. Several commenters, however, recommended additions and/or corrections
to the table. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenting in opposition to the incorporation by reference of industry standards, New York stated that ``[a]doption
by reference will cause confusion and make conformance by the industry difficult and also require the industry and
enforcement personnel to use numerous documents in determining appropriate securement methodologies. The regulations
should be self-contained and clear in their wording.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters questioned the need for including requirements for steel strapping. Maine, for example, stated:
``While strapping may be used to secure materials to pallets, it is seldom used to hold freight to a vehicle. Since the
material is not reused, it has little direct vehicle application.'' However, Connecticut argued that ``[e]nforcement
of Section 393.102 would be greatly enhanced if most common dimensions and strengths of steel strapping were added
to the tables of working load limits.'' The CVSA stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The steel strap manufacturers have recently formed an association which is presently developing recommendations
on their products. Steel strapping is typically not used as the primary load securement device. Normally the strapping
will hold the cargo in bundles or to pallets while other devices are used to secure those bundles and pallets to the transporting
vehicle. Because steel strapping is not often used as a direct tiedown device and since the strap manufacturers are
now working through their association to develop strength and use guidelines, we recommend that this material not
be included in the proposed rule at this time. The new industry standards may well supersede the federal specification
referenced in the docket. Delaying action at this time could well reduce future confusion over regulatory requirements
for steel strapping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the incorporation by reference of rope standards, the Cordage Institute stated that ``[s]isal and nylon ropes
are not recommended [for cargo securement applications] and references to their standards [Sisal Rope Specifications
(SRS&hyph;1), Nylon Rope Specifications (NRS&hyph;1), and Double Braided Nylon Rope Specifications (C1)] should
be deleted.'' The Cordage Institute did not provide any information to support this recommendation and no other commenters
addressed this subject. It was recommended that the new standards for polypropylene fiber rope (PPRS&hyph;2, revised
August 1992) and polyester fiber rope (PETRS&hyph;2, revised January 1993) be used in place of P/PRS&hyph;1, May
1979 and PRS&hyph;1, May 1979, respectively. The Cordage Institute also provided clarification of its recommendations
on calculating working load limit values. Its policy on working load limit values has changed from using a specific
design factor for each size of cordage/rope to a design factor range. This approach leaves the selection of a specific
value to the particular applications for which the cordage will be used. For cargo securement applications involving
polypropylene and polyester fiber ropes, the Cordage Institute recommended a design factor of 6_the working load
limit would be equal to 1/6 of the minimum breaking strengths listed in PPRS&hyph;2 and PETRS&hyph;2. The Cordage
Institute recommended that the working load limits for manila rope be 1/2 that of the polypropylene fiber rope of the
same diameter. Working load limit values were also recommended for ``California Truck Rope''_rope meeting the requirements
of Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations, &sect;1303(e). The Cordage Institute also suggested that the FHWA
include California's &sect;1303(e) requirements for synthetic fiber rope (e.g., rope shall be treated for ultraviolet
resistance, rope must have an orange surface marker in each rope strand, prohibition on the use of solid orange rope,
etc.).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to those commenters opposed to the incorporation by reference of certain manufacturing standards, the
FHWA notes that the intent of this process is to reduce the volume of material published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and Code of Federal Regulations by referencing relevant material published by the private sector. The legal effect
of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force and effect of law. Motor carriers do not need
to obtain copies of all of the materials which are incorporated by reference but only those that are relevant to their
specific circumstances (e.g., carriers relying solely upon steel chains do not need to obtain copies of standards
for steel strapping, cordage, webbing, or wire rope). Although there may be advantages to printing certain texts
from private sector documents in the regulations, the FHWA does not intend &sect;393.102 to be a technical reference
on manufacturing standards. Both the volume and complexity of the information covered in the referenced documents
is too great to be effectively presented in the FMCSRs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the specific documents to be incorporated by reference, the final rule differs from the NPRM in that it does not
refer to Federal Specification No. A&hyph;A&hyph;880, Strapping, Steel Flat and Seals (May 13, 1980). Instead,
the final rule incorporates American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D3953&hyph;91, Standard Specification
for Strapping, Flat Steel and Seals. As the CVSA noted in its comments, steel strap manufacturers, working in conjunction
with the ASTM, are currently developing recommendations or guidelines concerning the use of steel strapping in load
securement. The FHWA has reviewed the preliminary strength and use guidelines that ASTM Subcommittee D10.14 provided
to the CVSA concerning breaking strengths and working load limits for steel strapping or banding. A copy of the preliminary
strength and use guidelines is included in the docket file. The working load limits are 1/4 of the breaking strengths
(the breaking strength multiplied by a design factor of 1/3 and a ``joint efficiency'' of 0.75) listed in ASTM D3953&hyph;91.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a review of ASTM D3953&hyph;91, the FHWA has determined that the preliminary strength and use guidelines of
ASTM Subcommittee D10.14 have merit and could, to some extent, be addressed in the final rule through the incorporation
by reference of ASTM D3953&hyph;91. The FHWA has compared the requirements of Federal Specification No. A&hyph;A&hyph;880
with those of ASTM D3953&hyph;91 and determined that the ASTM standard specification would serve as a better reference
for manufacturers and carriers to use in determining if certain sizes or grades of steel strapping are adequate for
cargo securement applications. Although the ASTM subcommittee (D10.14) is developing new guidelines, most of its
preliminary recommendations are based on ASTM D3953&hyph;91. Therefore, the FHWA believes that it is appropriate
to incorporate by reference the ASTM standard specification at this time, and consider the ASTM strength and use guidelines
for incorporation after they have been published.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As for cordage specifications, the FHWA is incorporating by reference (1) CRS&hyph;1, Polyester/Polypropylene
Composite Rope Specifications, Three- and Eight-Strand Standard Construction, May 1979, (2) PPRS&hyph;2, Polypropylene
Fiber Rope, 3-Strand and 8-Strand Constructions, revised August 1992, (3) PETRS&hyph;2, Polyester Fiber Rope,
3-Strand and 8-Strand Constructions, revised January 1993, (4) NRS&hyph;1, Nylon Rope Specifications, Three-
and Eight-Strand Standard Construction, May 1979, and (5) C1, Double Braided Nylon Rope Specifications, DBN-January
1984. The incorporation of CRS&hyph;1, NRS&hyph;1 and C1 is consistent with the NPRM and the inclusion of PPRS&hyph;2
and PETRS&hyph;2 is in response to the docket comments. The FHWA has reviewed the Cordage Institute's recommendation
concerning the working load limits for manila rope (three-strand laid construction), and notes that the recommendation
results in (1) an increase in the working load limit for rope with diameters of 3/16 through 1/2 inch and 21/2 through
4 inches, and (2) a decrease in the working load limits for diameters of 9/16 through 21/4 inches. The increases in working
load limits are generally between 1 and 5 percent for the 21/2 through 4 inch diameter ropes. The percentage increases
in the working load limits of 3/16 through 1/2-inch rope are much larger. However, the safety factors provided in MRS&hyph;1
for 3/16 through 1/2-inch rope were greater than those of the larger diameter ropes. The FHWA believes the working
load limit recommendations of the Cordage Institute provide reasonable safety factors for manila rope. Accordingly,
the FHWA is adopting these recommendations as part of the table of working load limits in the final rule. In light of
the Cordage Institute's recommendations concerning manila rope working load limits, the FHWA does not believe that
it is appropriate to incorporate by reference MRS&hyph;1. To do so would result in a contradiction between the working
load limits contained in MRS&hyph;1 and the working load limits (for cargo securement applications) recommended
by the Cordage Institute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA accepts the Cordage Institute's suggestion to delete the reference to sisal rope (SRS&hyph;1), but does
not believe that excluding nylon rope specifications from the final rule is appropriate. The final rule is not intended
to incorporate standards for all tiedown materials, but only the most commonly used. In that context, and in consideration
of the relatively low working load limits for sisal rope the FHWA does not believe that including a specification for
sisal rope is essential. The FHWA notes that the rule does not prohibit the use of sisal rope.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the nylon rope specifications, the references remain as originally proposed. Although the agency cannot quantify
the extent to which nylon rope is used, the working load limits for nylon rope are such that its usage in cargo securement
applications is likely.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA is not adopting the Cordage Institute's recommendation to include rope requirements similar to those used
in the California Code of Regulations. With the exception of California's requirement for ultraviolet resistance,
the FHWA considers this particular regulatory language unnecessarily design restrictive in that it would prohibit,
without sufficient technical justification, certain synthetic rope and webbing based primarily on material and/or
color, irrespective of its strength or safety for use in cargo securement. As for ultraviolet resistance requirements,
the Cordage Institute did not provide, and the California regulations do not include, sufficient information to
enable the FHWA to establish specific and objective regulatory language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM requested comments on the method used in determining the working load limit for wire rope which is not marked.
Four commenters responded to this request. All supported the method described in the NPRM (i.e., 1/4 of the nominal
strength_the nominal strength multiplied by a design factor of 1/3 and the ``termination efficiency,'' 0.75). Therefore,
&sect;393.102(b) includes this method for determining the working load limit of unmarked wire rope.

Marking and Labeling of Tiedown Devices

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters responded to the FHWA's questions concerning the need for requiring the use of only those tiedown
devices which are marked or labeled with the working load limit. For example, the CVSA stated:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of tiedowns have indicated that they are willing to mark load securement devices with working load
limit ratings. We believe having working load values marked on load securement devices is a significant aid to their
proper use and we would like to see such markings universally required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We recognize that presently, much of the tiedown equipment in the field is either unmarked or not directly marked with
working load limit. As it would be an extreme waste of resources and a huge financial burden on carriers to scrap today's
inventory of products not marked with working load limit, we would recommend the requirement for marking working
load limits be made effective at some future date, i.e., three to five years. Another way to handle this would be to grandfather
the tiedown equipment already manufactured and being used by the motor carrier industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New York believed the final rule should ``clearly state that unmarked cargo securement devices, steel strapping,
chain, webbing, wire rope, etc. will not be allowed and will cause vehicles transporting materials with unmarked
devices to be placed out-of-service. There is no way to effectively ensure the adequacy of unmarked devices.''

The OOIDA stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Owner-operators frequently purchase tie-down hooks, chains, wire ropes, etc. at truck stops or other similar locations.
Drivers need to be assured that the items purchased meet all applicable safety standards. Therefore, the Agency should
take steps to require prominent displays on packaging that will ensure that the product meets safety requirements.
Specific details on packaging as to working load limit are preferable to general statements that manufacturing standards
are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the FHWA is aware of the need for carriers and enforcement officials to be able to identify the various cargo securement
devices and the associated working load limits, the final rule does not include a requirement for marking and labeling
of these devices. Such a requirement must take into account manufacturers' practices as well as the need for uniformity.
The commenters did not provide any listings of current marking and labeling practices to assist the FHWA in determining
appropriate regulatory language. The agency cannot estimate what percentage of tiedown equipment currently in
use by motor carriers or stocked by manufacturers and retailers is unmarked or not directly marked with a working load
limit. Although a general requirement for the use of marked and labeled equipment could be included in &sect;393.102,
the absence of specific and objective guidelines as to what constitutes an acceptable mark or label for each type of
tiedown (i.e., chain, synthetic webbing, wire rope, steel strapping, cordage) would create enforcement difficulties.
The FHWA encourages tiedown manufacturers to develop uniform systems of marking and labeling their products to assist
motor carriers and enforcement officials in determining working load limits.

Applicability of Cargo Securement Regulations to Shippers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New York and the OOIDA expressed concern about the applicability of the cargo securement regulations to shippers.
Citing the catastrophic results of accidents caused by inadequate securement of steel and aluminum products, New
York believed the ``federal regulations should assign responsibility for proper cargo securement of steel and aluminum
products to both the shipper and the carrier.'' The OOIDA stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A large degree of responsibility for cargo securement lies squarely with the individual shipper. It is the shipper
who selects and ultimately contracts with various motor carriers to transport their commodities. Each shipper has
an obligation to scrutinize every prospective carrier and engage only those capable of providing the proper equipment
and expertise necessary to safely haul their specific product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA acknowledges these concerns. Whatever the merits of these arguments, however, the FHWA has no statutory
authority to regulate shippers of steel and aluminum products.

Future Rulemakings on Cargo Securement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters discussed the need for amending or clarifying numerous provisions of the cargo securement regulations
as well as the need for research. The Illinois Department of Transportation wrote: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Illinois is concerned that application of the proposed aggregate working load limit formula may not provide adequate
margins of safety. What may be considered adequate securement for general freight may not be adequate for other loads.
The regulations identify unique securement standards for intermodal containers. Coils and metal articles also
have special securement requirements. Cargo weight and load configuration both need to be factored into the performance
standards expected from tiedown systems *&blank;*&blank;*. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential gravity and actual severity of incidents involving the transportation of metal coils, their frequency
of occurrence and the high number of apparent violations of the securement regulations give credibility to the need
to reevaluate the securement regulations. These concerns have led Illinois to sponsor a university research project
to examine the unique properties of metal coil cargo securement *&blank;*&blank;*. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project will take 15 months and focus upon five areas: (1) Review and evaluate current systems, (2) examine the
volume of coils transported and the types of securement systems in use in Illinois, (3) evaluate the knowledge of persons
using or enforcing the securement regulations, (4) perform engineering dynamic studies to evaluate securement
systems, and (5) recommend improvements in securement systems and/or educational efforts for persons involved
in both the transportation and enforcement areas of the regulations. Upon its completion, the results and conclusion
of this project will be made available to FHWA and other parties interested in transportation safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The research project will examine the dynamic forces affecting securement systems during normal driving and during
less than ideal transportation conditions such as hard braking, emergency maneuvers or sharp radius turns. Illinois'
data indicates loss of cargo commonly occurs during these less than ideal conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA welcomes efforts by academia, tiedown and vehicle manufacturers, motor carriers, and others conducting
research or studies directed at reducing the incidence of cargo securement-related accidents. Currently the FHWA
is working with the Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators, State and Provincial agencies responsible
for motor carrier safety activities, and U.S. and Canadian industry groups to conduct a comprehensive research program
on cargo securement. A report identifying certain cargo securement issues needing research and describing a program
to address them was published by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation in November 1993. A copy of the report entitled
``A Proposal for Research to Provide a Technical Basis for a Revised National Standard on Load Security for Heavy Trucks''
is included in the docket file. It is expected that this research, along with efforts such as those described by Illinois,
will contribute greatly toward evaluating current cargo securement regulations and industry practices and providing
recommendations for specific actions needed to improve safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule is not intended to preclude consideration of future rulemakings on cargo securement.

Discussion of Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA is amending &sect;393.102(b) to require that the aggregate working load limit of the tiedown assemblies
used to secure an article against movement in any direction be at least 1/2 the weight of the article secured. Steel
strapping, chain, synthetic webbing, wire rope, and cordage used must meet certain manufacturing or performance
standards which are incorporated by reference. The incorporation of these standards is intended to specify minimum
requirements for tiedowns and not to restrict the use of tiedowns which exceed the criteria contained therein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 393.7, which was proposed in its entirety in the NPRM, was created by the final rule entitled ``Parts and Accessories
Necessary for Safe Operation; Warning Devices for Stopped Vehicles'' (RIN 2125&hyph;AD17; FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;93&hyph;19),
which is published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The FHWA is amending &sect;393.7, Matter incorporated by reference, to provide the language of incorporation required
by 1 CFR 51 and to provide information on the availability of the incorporated documents. After a review of the responses
to the September 17, 1993, NPRM and a determination that the incorporation by reference was necessary for the final
rule, the FHWA submitted the documents listed in &sect;393.102(b)(1) to (b)(5) to the Director of the Federal Register
for approval in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR 51. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule does not require tiedowns to be marked or labeled. However, manufacturers of tiedowns and associated
equipment are encouraged to provide motor carriers and enforcement officials with a means to easily determine the
working load limits of their products. For those cases in which the tiedown manufacturing standards (incorporated
by reference into the final rule) include guidelines for marking and labeling, adherence to those guidelines is encouraged,
but is not mandated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 393.102(b) is amended to include a table of working load limits for common types and sizes of tiedown devices.
The working load limits listed in the table are to be used when the tiedown material is not marked by the manufacturer
with the working load limit. Tiedown materials marked by the manufacturer with working load limits which differ from
the table, shall be considered to have a working load limit equal to the value for which they are marked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the working load limits for cordage, the table lists values for manila, polypropylene, polyester,
and nylon cordage. For those cases in which the a synthetic rope does not have a manufacturers' marking or label to enable
motor carriers and enforcement officials to distinguish between polypropylene, polyester fiber ropes, polyester/polypropylene
composite rope, or nylon rope, the working load limits of polypropylene fiber rope shall be used. Since polypropylene
fiber rope generally has a lower working load limit than polyester and nylon ropes, this provision is important to
ensure safety. The agency notes that the working load limits for nylon rope are based on the specific design factors
in the nylon rope specifications, NRS&hyph;1 and C1. These design factors are between 9 and 12 for three- and eight-strand
standard construction nylon rope and between 7 and 11 for double braided nylon rope. As a result, the working load limits
shown in &sect;393.102 for certain sizes of nylon rope are lower than that for polypropylene fiber rope. Considering
the Cordage Institute's recommendation for a design factor of 6 for polypropylene fiber rope and polyester rope,
the FHWA believes that the use of polypropylene fiber rope working load limits is appropriate in those cases in which
the rope cannot be identified as nylon. The table of working load limits does not include information on polyester/polypropylene
composite rope because the working load limit values are generally very close, if not identical, to those of polypropylene
fiber rope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of steel strapping, wire rope, and cordage, the final rule includes a procedure for calculating the working
load limits. The published industry standards for these materials use breaking strengths, nominal strengths, and
working load limit ranges respectively. To ensure consistency in calculating the working load limits and an appropriate
safety margin in determining the number of tiedown devices required, these procedures must be used when the working
load limit is not provided by the manufacturer or when the manufacturer provides working load limit ranges for cargo
securement applications.

This final rule amends the requirements for the strength ratings for cargo securement devices. The FHWA has determined
that this is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or significant within
the meaning of the Department of Transportation policies and procedures. It is anticipated that the economic impact
of this rulemaking will be minimal. The final rule requires that the aggregate working load limits of the tiedown assemblies
used to secure cargo be at least 1/2 times the weight of the article being secured. The total number of tiedown assemblies
required by the rule would generally be the same as or slightly more than the number required using the previous breaking
strength terminology. It is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal. Therefore,
a full regulatory evaluation is not required.

In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the agency has evaluated the effects
of this rulemaking on small entities. As previously stated, the final rule amends &sect;393.102(b) of the Federal
Motor Carrier Safety Regulations by requiring that the aggregate working load limits of the tiedown assemblies used
to secure cargo be at least 1/2 times the weight of the article being secured. The total number of tiedown assemblies
required by the rule would generally be the same as or slightly more than the number required prior to this amendment.
Based on the evaluation, the FHWA certifies that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 27, 1992, OMB published a proposed version of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 (57 FR 39018). OMB received over 200
comments from Federal agencies, non-profit organizations, professional organizations, and others. After considering
all comments, OMB published the circular in final form on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary revises Parts 74 (Administration of Grants) and 77 (Definitions that Apply to Department Regulations)
of EDGAR to incorporate the revised Circular. The Secretary has deviated from the text of the Circular to make certain
technical changes. In addition, the Secretary has made two substantive changes to the text of the Circular. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 412 of the Department of Education Organization Act (DEOA)(20 U.S.C. 3472) provides that the Secretary may
delegate the functions of the Department only to officers and employees of the Department. Section 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 .4 of the Circular, however, has the effect of delegating one of the Secretary's functions_granting exceptions to
the regulations as promulgated by the Secretary for Department programs_to employees of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB). In order to avoid this conflict with the DEOA, the Secretary is deviating from the text of the Circular
to authorize the Secretary to grant exceptions to the regulations after consultation with appropriate officials
of OMB.

Section 437(a) of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) (20 U.S.C. 1232f) requires that records be retained

.53(b) of the Circular, as established by OMB, however, requires recipients to retain financial records, supporting
documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to the award for a period of three years. The Secretary
has changed this requirement in &sect;74.53(b) of the regulations to require recipients to retain records for five
years in accordance with GEPA.

The revised Circular A&hyph;110 as implemented in 34 CFR Parts 74 and 77 of the Education Department General Administrative
Regulations (EDGAR) (1) harmonize the regulations with numerous and significant changes in grant administrative
practice and legislation since the original Circular was issued in 1976; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) bring the requirements for institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations
closer to those contained for State, local, and tribal governments in OMB Circular A&hyph;102 (implemented by the
Department at 34 CFR Part 80) so that the Department's grant administration is more uniform across classes of recipients;
(3) reduce regulatory burden on and give greater flexibility to recipients in numerous cases; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) strengthen certain provisions in order to protect the Federal interest. The Circular, as implemented in these

In some cases, the regulatory language in these sections represent changes in policy or procedure in the administration

administrative policy or procedures of the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity
to comment on proposed regulations. However, the Secretary waives rulemaking on these regulations under section
553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (20 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)). This section provides that rulemaking is not
required when the agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or
contrary to the public interest. The Secretary believes further public comment on the technical changes made to the
Circular is unnecessary because the substance of these provisions has already been subjected to public comment during
OMB's solicitation of public comment. The Secretary also believes that further public comment on the substantive
changes to the Circular is unnecessary because these changes incorporate statutory requirements that the Secretary
is not authorized to change.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the final regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the Department's programs effectively and efficiently.
Burdens, specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained
elsewhere in this preamble under the heading

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary
has determined that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary certifies that these regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The small entities that would be affected by these regulations are institutions of higher education, hospitals,
and other non-profit organizations. However, the regulations would not have a significant economic impact on these
small institutions because the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary
Federal supervision. The regulations would impose minimal requirements to ensure the proper expenditure of program
funds.

 In each instance, the Secretary decides on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement,
or contract). The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301&hyph;08) governs the use of grants,
cooperative agreements, and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose
of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory
criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, substantial involvement
is expected between ED and the recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement. Contracts
shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the
Federal Government.

The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the
metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency
to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement
will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation
may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies
in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. The Secretary follows the provisions of E.O. 12770_Metric
Usage in Federal Government Programs.

Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94&hyph;580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State
agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with section
6002 of the RCRA. Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific
products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) (40 CFR Parts 247&hyph;254). Accordingly, recipients that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal
funds shall give preference in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products
pursuant to the EPA guidelines.

accordance with the reporting requirements established in &sect;74.52. If the Secretary requires reporting on
an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not
be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop accrual data for its reports
on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These
records shall contain information pertaining to awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,
assets, outlays, income, and interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should
be related to performance and unit cost data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury
and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient.
To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;453) govern, payment
methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements
or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR Part 205_Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under
Federal Grant and Other Programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability, and allowability of costs in accordance
with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Secretary
may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed
adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Secretary may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect
the Federal Government's interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Where bonds are required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the bonds shall be obtained from companies

and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of
State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures
codified at 31 CFR Part 205.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in
&sect;74.21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Cash advances to a recipient organization are limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance
with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved
program or project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The timing and amount of cash advances are as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements
by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Whenever possible, advances are consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Secretary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check, and electronic funds transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR Part 205. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Recipients are authorized to submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic
fund transfers are not used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF&hyph;270_Request for Advance or Reimbursement_or
other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to the
recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by ED instructions for
electronic funds transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. The
Secretary may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project
is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor
portion of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Secretary makes payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing,
unless the billing is improper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Recipients are authorized to submit request for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers
are not used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Secretary has determined that reimbursement
is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Secretary may provide cash on a working
capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Secretary advances cash to the recipient to cover its estimated
disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Secretary
reimburses the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment is not
used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's
actual cash disbursements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on
a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, and interest earned
on these funds before requesting additional cash payments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, the Secretary does not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients
at any time during the project period unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal
reporting requirements; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A&hyph;129_Managing
Federal Credit Programs. Under these conditions, the Secretary may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient
that ED does not make payments for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected
or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards
are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, the Secretary does not require separate
depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories
for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation, and expenditure
of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business
enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at
least 50 percent by women or minority group members). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250
per year on Federal cash balances; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected
Federal and non-Federal cash resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances
deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment
Management System, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative
expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject
to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from the
Secretary, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms are authorized for the recipients in requesting
advances and reimbursements. The Secretary does not require more than an original and two copies of the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF&hyph;270_Request for Advance or Reimbursement. The Secretary adopts the SF&hyph;270 as a standard form for
all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. The
Secretary may, however, use this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF&hyph;271_Outlay Report and Request
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) SF&hyph;271_Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The Secretary adopts the
SF&hyph;271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, the
Secretary may substitute the SF&hyph;270 when the Secretary determines that it provides adequate information to
meet Federal needs.

for cost sharing or matching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the
Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable
cost principles. If the Secretary authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities
acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the
lesser of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time
of donation; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The current fair market value. However, if there is sufficient justification, the Secretary may approve the use
of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation
to the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled
labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project
or program. Rates for volunteer services must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization.
In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates must be consistent
with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved.
In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued
at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable,
but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally
paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies, or workshop
and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be
reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings, and land for which
title passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total
value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally
only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other
capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Secretary has approved the charges.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The value of donated property must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient,
with the following qualifications: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The value of donated land and buildings may not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient
as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration
representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The value of donated equipment may not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at
the time of donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The value of donated space may not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent
appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period must be retained

or more of the following ways: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Secretary prescribes requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired
in whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, the minimum requirements provide the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Title to real property must vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real
property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without
approval of the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Secretary for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored
projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project.
Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) that have purposes
consistent with those authorized for support by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall
request disposition instructions from ED or its successor Federal awarding agency. The Secretary observes one or
more of the following disposition instructions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates
the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal
participation in the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by the Secretary and pay the Federal
Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation
in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds).
When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures must be established that
provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third
party. The recipient is entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value
of the property.

or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to the Secretary for further ED utilization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If ED has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration,
unless the Secretary has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority
provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational
and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821_Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support

without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate.
This property is ``exempt property.'' Should the Secretary not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon
acquisition vests in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.

(b) The recipient may not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations
for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal
statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and may not encumber the property without approval
of the Secretary. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the equipment
in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Activities sponsored by the Federal awarding agency which funded the original project; and then
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make
it available for use on other projects or programs if other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program
for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other projects or
programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given
to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government,
use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the Federal
awarding agency. User charges shall be treated as program income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the
equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of the Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned
equipment shall include all of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A description of the equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification
number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment
(not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Unit acquisition cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current
fair market value where a recipient compensates ED for its share.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government must be identified to indicate Federal ownership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A physical inventory of equipment must be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least
once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in
the accounting records must be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection
with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A control system must be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment.
Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the
Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Adequate maintenance procedures must be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures must be established
which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance
with the following standards:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment
for other uses provided that compensation is made to ED or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed
by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair
market value of the equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the
Secretary. The Secretary shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet ED requirements. If no requirement
exists within ED, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration by the
Secretary to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. The Secretary issues
instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures
govern:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's
request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse ED an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds
the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall
be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for
the recipient's selling and handling expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient is reimbursed by ED by an amount
which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost of the original project
or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs
incurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient is reimbursed by ED for costs
incurred in its disposition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The Secretary may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by
the Federal Government when the third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. This transfer shall be
subject to the following standards:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The equipment must be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The Secretary issues disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory. The
final inventory must list all equipment acquired with grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If the Secretary
does not issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the recipient shall apply the standards
of this section, as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) When the Secretary exercises the right to take title, the equipment is subject to the provisions for federally-owned
equipment.

or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the recipient shall
retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate
the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 74.41 through 74.48 contain standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement
of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property, and other services with Federal funds. These
standards are designed to ensure that these materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance
with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. The Secretary does not impose additional
procurement standards or requirements upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive
order or as authorized in &sect;&sect;74.4 or 74.14.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising
under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Secretary, regarding
the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered
into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation,
or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to Federal, State
or local authority that may have proper jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in
the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award,
or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved.
A conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner,
or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other
interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit
nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements. However,
recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited
item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations
of these standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.

All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and
free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive
practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to
ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop
or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids or requests for proposals shall
be excluded from competing for procurements. Awards must be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is responsive
to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations
shall clearly establish all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be
evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.

that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured.
In competitive procurements, a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) The specific features of brand name or equal descriptions that bidders are required to meet when these items are
included in the solicitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in
the metric system of measurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural
resources and protect the environment, and are energy efficient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's
business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further
this goal:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest
extent practicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts
to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises
when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of organizations such as the Small Business Administration
and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small
businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase
orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but must be appropriate for the particular
procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost''
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting must not be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Contracts are made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration is given to matters as contractor integrity,
record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources. In
certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by E.O. 12549 (implemented by the Secretary
in 34 CFR Part 85) and E.O. 12689_Debarment and Suspension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Secretary, pre-award review and procurement documents,
such as request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the following
conditions apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000)
and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under
a sealed bid procurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than
the amount of the small purchase threshold.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some form of cost or price analysis must be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement
action. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted,
market prices and similar indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element
of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability, and allowability.

A system for contract administration must be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions

Contract provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions
in all contracts. The following provisions must also be applied to subcontracts: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that
allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches
the contract terms, and provide for remedial actions as may be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by
the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition,
contracts must describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default, as well as conditions
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction
or facility improvements must provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees,
performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those
contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Secretary may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the
recipient, provided the Secretary has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately
protected. If a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' must consist
of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute contractual documents as may be required within the time
specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is
one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under a contract.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed
in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material
in the execution of the work provided for in the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where bonds are required, the bonds must be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable
sureties pursuant to 31 CFR Part 223_Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients must
include a provision to the effect that the recipient, ED, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their
duly authorized representatives, must have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor
which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors must contain the procurement
provisions of Appendix A to this part, as applicable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function, or activity
supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the audit requirements
in &sect;74.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Secretary prescribes the frequency with which the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided
in &sect;74.51(f), performance reports are not required more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently than
annually. Annual reports are due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual reports are due 30
days after the reporting period. The Secretary may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple
year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration
or termination of the award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report is not required after completion of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When required, performance reports must generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings
of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified,
this quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis, and explanation of cost overruns or high
unit costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Recipients are not required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Recipients shall immediately notify the Secretary of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported
activities. Also, notification must be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially
impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification must include a statement of the action taken
or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The Secretary may make site visits, as needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The following forms or other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information
from recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A_Financial Status Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Recipients are required to use the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction
projects or programs. The Secretary may not require the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A when, the Secretary determines
that SF&hyph;270_Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF&hyph;272_Report of Federal Cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transactions_provides adequate information to meet the Department's needs, except that a final SF&hyph;269 or
SF&hyph;269A is required at the completion of the project when the SF&hyph;270 is used only for advances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Secretary prescribes whether the report is on a cash or accrual basis. If the Secretary requires accrual information
and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient is not required to
convert its accounting system, but shall develop accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis
of the documentation on hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The Secretary determines the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering
the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report is not required more frequently
than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report is required at the completion of the agreement.

(iv) The Secretary requires recipients to submit the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A (an original and no more than two
copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual reports,
and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the Secretary
upon request of the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When funds are advanced to recipients the Secretary requires each recipient to submit the SF&hyph;272 and, when
necessary, its continuation sheet, SF&hyph;272a. The Secretary uses this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients
and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Secretary may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, the Secretary may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section
the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations
of actions taken to reduce the excess balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF&hyph;272 15 calendar
days following the end of each quarter. The Secretary may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving
advances totaling $1 million or more per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The Secretary may waive the requirement for submission of the SF&hyph;272 for any one of the following reasons:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that advances are monitored through other
forms contained in this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If, in the Secretary's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal
advances; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When the Secretary needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, the Secretary shall issue instructions
to require recipients to submit information under the ``Remarks'' section of the reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the Secretary determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in &sect;74.21,
additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient
until the system is brought up to standard. The Secretary, in obtaining this information, complies with the report
clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Secretary may shade out any line item on any report if not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Secretary may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer
printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Secretary may provide computer or electronic outputs to recipients when these outputs expedite or contribute
to the accuracy of reporting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall
be retained for a period of five years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Secretary requests transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the
records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, the Secretary may
make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Secretary, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized
representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records
of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts, and
copies of documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose
of interview and discussion related to these documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the
required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Unless required by statute, the Secretary does not place restrictions on recipients that limit public access
to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Secretary can demonstrate that the records
must be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act
(5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to ED. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The starting date for retention of the following types of documents (including supporting records) is specified
in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section: indirect cost rate computations or proposals; cost allocation plans;
and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer
usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If submitted for negotiation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the recipient submits to the Secretary or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other
computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 5-year retention period for its supporting records
starts on the date of submission.

Effects of suspension and termination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination
of an award are not allowable unless the Secretary expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination
or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably
avoidable are allowable if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension
or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period
in which the termination takes effect.

to the Federal Government for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the entire legal entity even if only a particular
component of the entity is designated in the award document. For example, a grant award document may name as the grantee
one school or campus of a university. In this case, the granting agency usually intends, or actually intends, that
the named component assume primary or sole responsibility for administering the grant-assisted project or program.
Nevertheless, the naming of a component of a legal entity as the grantee in a grant award document shall not be construed
as relieving the whole legal entity from accountability to the Federal Government for the use of the funds provided.
(This definition is not intended to affect the eligibility provision of grant programs in which eligibility is limited
to organizations which may be only components of a legal entity.) The term ``grantee'' does not include any secondary
recipients such as subgrantees, contractors, etc., who may receive funds from a grantee pursuant to a grant. The definition
of ``grantee'' for State, local, and tribal governments is contained in 34 CFR 80.3.

 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is revising and reorganizing its regulations on Smoking/No Smoking Areas.
As revised, designated smoking areas at the Bureau's medical referral centers and minimum security institutions
ordinarily shall be outside of buildings and away from entrances. Wardens at all low, medium, high, and administrative
institutions other than medical referral centers may continue, but are not required, to designate indoor smoking
areas in addition to outdoor smoking areas. Additional provisions have been revised or reorganized for the sake of
clarity or to avoid redundancy. This amendment is intended to provide for a clean air environment and to protect the
health and safety of staff and inmates.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on Smoking/No Smoking Areas. A final rule on this subject was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 16, 1989 (54 FR 47753). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 8, 1994, the Bureau of Prisons published a proposed rule requiring that ``smoking areas'' to be designated
by Wardens at medical referral centers and at minimum security institutions shall ordinarily be outside of all buildings
and away from all entrances so as not to expose others to second-hand smoke. As for the remaining Bureau institutions,
the proposed rule specifies that the Warden may, but is not required to, designate indoor smoking areas in addition
to outdoor smoking areas. The proposed rule also reorganized and revised the regulations for the sake of clarity and
to avoid redundancy. For example, the regulations had contained cross references qualifying those locations where
smoking ordinarily was not permitted. Because the Warden is responsible for designating smoking areas, ordinarily
only where the needs of effective operations so require, the Bureau deems it unnecessary to list in its revised regulations
specific locations which would still be subject to the Warden's discretion. The listing of these locations has therefore
been removed from the regulation, but remains as guidance in implementing instructions to staff. The revised regulations
also contain a nomenclature change in which the title ``Warden'' has been substituted for ``Chief Executive Officer''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period closed on April 11, 1994. The Bureau received comments from only one respondent. The commenter,
a public health interest group, stated that it supported the proposal and believed it to be an important health measure.
The commenter further recommended that in the cases in which the Warden decides to designate an indoor smoking area,
the area should be separately ventilated so that the air is vented directly to the outside and does not mix with the air
circulating in other parts of the facility. Finally, the commenter stated that it believed it essential that smoking
cessation services for employees and inmates be made available as part of a policy for a smokefree environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, the Bureau wishes to note that guidance on ventilation requirements for indoor smoking
areas is provided in its internal instructions to staff. Given the limited number of indoor smoking areas which may
be authorized under &sect;551.163(b) and the constraints of operations in a correctional setting, the Bureau believes
it unnecessary to include more specific direction in its regulations. The Bureau also wishes to note that separate
policy on the provisioning of wellness programs to staff and to inmates does allow for participation in smoking cessation
programs. While budget and staff limitations initially may limit such staff and inmate participation to those institutions
most affected by the revised regulations, the Bureau is committed to extending program opportunities at all facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in light of the above comment and agency response, the Bureau is adopting the proposed amendments as a final
rule without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
