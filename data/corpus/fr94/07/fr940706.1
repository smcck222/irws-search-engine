SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to The Endstrom
Helicopter Corporation Model F&hyph;28A, F&hyph;28C, 280, and 280C series helicopters, that currently requires
an initial and repetitive visual inspections of the upper swashplate bearings for corrosion, and replacement of
defective upper swashplate bearings with airworthy bearings. This action would require that the visual inspections
apply to both the upper and lower swashplate bearings (bearings); expand the applicability to those affected helicopters
manufactured prior to January 1, 1981; establish a retirement life of 1,200 hours' time-in-service for certain bearings;
and provide a corrected upper swashplate bearing part number. This proposal is prompted by the necessity to require
visual inspection so the lower swashplate bearings; expand the applicability to include the Model F&hyph;28C&hyph;2
helicopter; establish a retirement life for certain bearings; and correct the upper swashplate bearing part number
from the existing AD. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the bearings and subsequent
loss of control of the helicopter.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 19, 1976, the FAA issued AD 76&hyph;01&hyph;11, Amendment 39&hyph;2560, (41 FR 13906, April 1, 1976), to
require an initial and repetitive visual inspection of the upper swashplate bearing, part number (P/N) Z993L13XR3B,
for corrosion, and replacement of corroded upper swashplate bearings. That action was prompted by three reports
of upper swashplate bearing failures that were attributed to corrosion. These failures occurred between 205 and
586 hours' time-in-service (TIS). In two of these incidents, the probable cause of the upper swashplate bearing failures
was corrosion of the balls and race due to water impregnating the housing after the loss of lubricant. This led to a spalling
interaction between the balls and race, resulting in upper swashplate bearing failure. After reviewing the data,
the FAA has determined that corrosion of either upper or lower bearings (bearings) could create an unsafe condition.
These conditions, if not corrected, could result in failure of the bearings and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Since the issuance of that AD, improved and modified bearings have been approved by the FAA for these model helicopters.
Additionally, the manufacturer has issued The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Information Letter (SIL)
No. 0110, Revision B, dated March 18, 1993, that extends the previous visual inspections to include the Model F&hyph;28C&hyph;2
helicopters. The SIL describes an approved swashplate modification and indicates that the SIL should only apply
to those affected helicopters manufactured prior to January 1, 1981. In addition, a swashplate modification that
would constitute terminating action for the requirements of this AD has been approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 76&hyph;06&hyph;11 to require visual inspections of the lower swashplate
bearings; expand the applicability to the Model F&hyph;28C&hyph;2 helicopter; establish a retirement life of 1,200
hours' time-in-service for certain upper and lower swashplate bearings; and correct the upper swashplate bearing
part number in the existing AD. This proposed AD would also provide an optional terminating action from the requirements
of this AD and limit the applicability of the AD requirements to those affected model helicopters manufactured prior
to January 1, 1981.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 660 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
5 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $1,400 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,105,500.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace at Springdale, AR. Currently, Springdale, AR has Class D airspace
during the hours of operation of the Springdale Air Traffic Control Tower. This action is proposing to provide controlled
airspace, Class E, upward from the surface to contain instrument flight rule (IFR) operations during the hours that
the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace to contain
IFR operations during the hours that the control tower is closed at Springdale, AR.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Springdale, AR. Controlled airspace to the surface is needed during the hours that the control tower
is closed to contain IFR operations at the airport. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class
E airspace, during the hours that the control tower is closed, for IFR operations at Springdale Regional Airport,
Springdale, Arkansas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as
surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 958 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace
designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is reopening the rulemaking record for the proposed revision
of the regulation of personal protective equipment for shipyard employment (53 FR 48150, November 29, 1988) to incorporate
the rulemaking record developed for the recently revised regulation of personal protective equipment for general
industry (Docket S&hyph;060, final rule published in 59 FR 16334, April 6, 1994) and the record for the proposed regulation
of personal protective equipment (fall protection equipment for general industry) (Docket S&hyph;057, 55 FR 13423,
April 10, 1990). While the shipyard rulemaking on personal protective equipment (PPE) generated 10 comments, the
general industry rulemakings generated hundreds of comments and several thousand pages of hearing testimony regarding
PPE issues. The Agency believes the regulation of PPE in shipyard and general industry employment should be consistent,
in order to facilitate compliance and effective employee protection. OSHA has determined that the information in
Dockets S&hyph;060 and S&hyph;057 is relevant to full consideration of the issues raised by the shipyard PPE proposal,
and that it is appropriate to reopen the record to incorporate those materials and to allow the public an opportunity
to comment. This notice also raises specific PPE issues arising out of the general industry rulemakings for public
comment.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 29, 1988, OSHA proposed to revise the personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements in the shipyard
employment standards (part 1915, subpart I) (53 FR 48150). The proposal updated references to national consensus
standards and added requirements for hazard assessment, proper selection and care of PPE, training, lifesaving
equipment and personal fall protection equipment. The written comment period ended on February 27, 1989. The Agency
received 10 comments on the proposed rule. There were no hearing requests.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 16, 1989, OSHA proposed to update the existing general industry standards (part 1910, subpart I, Docket
S&hyph;060) for eye and face (&sect;1910.133), head (&sect;1910.135) and foot (1910.136) PPE and to add generic
requirements for hazard assessment, proper selection of PPE, prohibition on use of damaged or defective PPE and training
in the proper use of PPE (&sect;&sect;1910.132 (d) through (f)) (54 FR 33832). The proposed general industry revisions
were consistent with the corresponding provisions of the proposed rule for shipyard employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 10, 1990, the Agency proposed to add criteria for personal fall arrest equipment (&sect;&sect;1910.128,
1910.129 and 1910.131) and positioning device equipment (&sect;&sect;1910.128 and 1910.130) to the general industry
PPE standards (part 1910, subpart I, Docket S&hyph;057) (55 FR 13423). Again, the criteria proposed for general industry
PPE were consistent with those proposed for shipyards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two general industry rulemakings generated extensive records, including hundreds of comments and several thousand
pages of hearing testimony. On April 6, 1994, OSHA issued a final rule (59 FR 16334) which completed Agency action in
the Docket S&hyph;060 proceeding. Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA made some changes to the proposed rule in drafting
the final rule. In particular, OSHA revised the proposed training requirement so that it provides clear direction
regarding what constitutes adequate training and what circumstances trigger a requirement for retraining. In addition,
the final rule added requirements for the certification of the hazard assessment (&sect;1910.132(d)(2)) and certification
that the required training has been provided and understood (&sect;1910.132(f)(4)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, based on the rulemaking record for general industry fall protection PPE (Docket S&hyph;057), the Agency is
considering further limiting or prohibiting the use of body belts and non-locking snaphooks in personal fall arrest
systems. In particular, the evidence in the record supports the conclusion that an employee who falls while wearing
a body belt as part of a personal fall arrest system is substantially more likely to suffer death or serious injury than
would be the case if the employee were wearing a full body harness. Furthermore, the rulemaking record indicates that
locking snaphooks designed to prevent ``roll out'' (where snaphooks become accidentally disengaged during use)
provide a higher level of employee protection than single-action (non-locking) snaphooks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While it is appropriate to facilitate employer access to safety and health standards by maintaining separate standards
for general industry (part 1910) and for the shipyard industry (part 1915), the Agency believes that the substance
of those standards should be consistent. OSHA believes, based on its review of the pertinent rulemaking records,
that PPE used in shipyards does not differ markedly from PPE used in general industry. Therefore, the Agency has determined
that the information generated in the general industry rulemakings should be taken into account as the Agency drafts
the final rule for shipyard PPE, as well. To this end, OSHA is incorporating the general industry PPE rulemaking records
(Dockets S&hyph;057 and S&hyph;060) into the record for the shipyards PPE rulemaking. In addition, OSHA is reopening
the written comment period for the shipyard PPE proposal so the public has an opportunity to comment on the newly incorporated
materials.

II. Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA is requesting comments on these five specific issues:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certification of hazard assessment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. OSHA believes that a hazard assessment is an important element of a PPE program because it produces the information
needed to select the appropriate PPE for the hazards present or likely to be present at particular workplaces. The
Agency believes that employers are able to determine and evaluate the hazards of their particular workplaces and
to use this information for proper PPE selection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;1915.152(b) required employers to select the types of PPE to be used by employees based on an assessment
of the workplace hazards relative to PPE. The comments on proposed &sect;1910.132(d), which contained identical
language, indicated concern about the level of documentation required for hazards assessment (Exs. 3:1 and 3:68).
In regard to the general industry rulemaking, OSHA concluded that some form of record is needed to provide OSHA compliance
officers and affected employees with appropriate assurance that the required hazard assessment has been performed.
Given the performance-oriented nature of the rule, the Agency determined that the generation and review of extensive
documentation would be unnecessarily burdensome.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has addressed such situations in other rulemakings (e.g., permit-required confined spaces, &sect;1910.146(g)(4);
and the control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout), 1910.147(c)(7)(iv) by requiring employers to verify their
compliance with a requirement through a written certification. The Agency has found that a written certification
is a reasonable means by which to establish accountability for compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, OSHA determined that an employer could adequately verify compliance with the hazard assessment requirement
through a written certification which identified the workplace evaluated; the person certifying that the hazard
assessment had been performed; the date(s) of the hazard assessment; and which identified the document as a certification
of hazard assessment. Accordingly, the Agency added this requirement to the final rule as &sect;1910.132(d)(2).

OSHA believes that verification through written certification would also be appropriate with regard to hazard assessments
to be performed under proposed &sect;1915.152(b). Therefore, OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information,
as to the need for certification of the hazard assessment and the anticipated impact of such a requirement on the shipyard
industry.

Certification of training
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Proposed &sect;1915.152(e) required that employees be trained in the proper use of their PPE. Proposed &sect;1910.132(f)
contained an identical requirement. Based on comments received in relation to proposed &sect;1910.132(f) (Exs.
3:41, 3:46, 3:49, 3:62 and 3:129) which expressed concern regarding the level of documentation employers would be
required to provide for their training efforts, OSHA raised Issue 4 in the hearing notice (55 FR 3414, February 1, 1990)
to elicit additional information on the recordkeeping needed to document compliance with the proposed paragraph.
The commenters (Exs. 7:8, 7:19 and 7:39) generally supported some sort of certification for completion of training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the rulemaking record and the considerations raised above in regard to Reopening Issue 1, OSHA determined
that employers could adequately verify compliance with proposed &sect;1910.132(f) through a written certification.
Accordingly, the Agency revised proposed paragraph (f) to add paragraph (f)(4), which requires a certification
record that identifies each employee trained, the date(s) of training, and which identifies the document as a certification
of training in the use of PPE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that verification through written certification would also be appropriate with regard to training
to be provided under proposed &sect;1915.152(e). Therefore, OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information,
as to the need for certification of employee training and the anticipated impact of such a requirement on the shipyard
industry.

Training elements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As mentioned above, proposed &sect;1915.152(e) required that employees be trained in the proper use of their PPE,
and proposed &sect;1910.132(f) set forth an identical requirement. Based on comments and testimony received in
relation to proposed &sect;1910.132(f) (Exs. 3:36, 3:41, 3:50, 3:60, 3:73, 3:86, 3:88, 3:116, 3:128; 7:3, 7:8, 7:11,
7:20, 7:29, 7:38; Tr. 23:24; 4/3, Tr. 272&hyph;286; 4/4) which expressed concern that the proposed language did not
provide enough detailed guidance regarding what constituted adequate training, OSHA determined that more specific
guidance should be provided by the final requirement. Accordingly, the Agency determined that more specific guidance
was appropriate and revised proposed &sect;1910.132(f) to require, at a minimum, training in the following areas:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

&bull;The limitations of the PPE; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, many of the above comments and testimony suggested that in order to have a successful training program,
employers should set measurable training objectives and have their employees demonstrate that they have reached
those objectives. Also, it was suggested that retraining be provided, when the employer determined that employees
may not possess sufficient knowledge about the PPE. Accordingly, the following provisions were added to &sect;1910.132(f)
in the final rule:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each affected employee shall demonstrate an understanding of the training specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this
section, and the ability to use PPE properly, before being allowed to perform work requiring the use of PPE.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) When the employer has reason to believe that any affected employee who has already been trained does not have the
understanding and skill required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the employer shall retrain each such employee.
Circumstances where retraining is required include, but are not limited to, situations were:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Changes in the workplace render previous training obsolete; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Changes in the types of PPE to be used render previous training obsolete; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Inadequacies in an affected employee's knowledge or use of assigned PPE indicate that the employee has not retained
the requisite understanding or skill.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that these more specific training requirements would also be appropriate with regard to training provided
under &sect;1915.152(e). Therefore, OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information, as to the need for such
requirements and the anticipated impact of those requirements on the shipyard industry.

Body belts and harnesses in fall arrest systems.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed &sect;1910.129(b) provided the system performance criteria for personal fall arrest systems. In particular,
the proposed paragraph limited maximum arresting force on an employee to 900 pounds (4 kN) when using a body belt and
1,800 pounds (8 kN) when using a body harness. The corresponding provision for shipyard employment, proposed &sect;1915.159(a)(4)(iii),
limited maximum arresting force for either belts or harnesses to the lesser of 10 times the employee's weight, or 1,800
pounds (8 kN). The more protective criteria in proposed &sect;1910.129(b) are based on information obtained after
the Shipyard PPE proposal was issued (53 FR 48150, Nov. 29, 1988). This information is discussed in the General Industry
PPE proposal (55 FR 13423, April 10, 1990).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments and testimony received on proposed &sect;1910.129(b) (Exs. 3:22, 3:31; Tr. 240&hyph;241 and 1374) indicate
that the Agency needs to reconsider allowing the use of body belts in fall arrest systems. OSHA solicits comments,
with supporting information regarding whether or not body belts should be permitted for use in fall arrest systems,
and the anticipated impact on the shipyard industry of any requirement which might limit or prohibit their use.

Locking and non-locking snap hooks.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed &sect;1915.159 (a)(15), (a)(16), and (a)(17) prohibited certain snap hook connections (such as, connecting
snap hooks to each other) where snap hooks have been known to accidentally disengage, allowing an employee to fall.
Proposed &sect;1910.129(c)(1) required that snap hooks, unless of the locking type, and designed for certain connections
(such as to each other, to horizontal lifelines, or to incompatibly shaped objects), not be used for these connections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments and testimony received on the general industry provisions (Exs. 3:9, 3:12, 3:19; Tr. 210) has led the Agency
to consider a prohibition on the use of non-locking snap hooks in personal fall protection systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA solicits comments, with supporting information, regarding whether or not non-locking snap hooks should be
permitted for use in personal fall protection systems or in positioning device systems, and the anticipated impact
on the shipyard industry of any requirement which might further limit or prohibit their use.
