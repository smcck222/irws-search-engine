SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Energy (DOE) proposes to amend its regulations by adding a new Part to contain procedural regulations
governing proceedings before the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), a quasi-judicial branch of the DOE, pertaining
to matters within the jurisdiction of that Office. These proposed rules have been organized into a new part 1003 within
chapter X of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations. They streamline and distill the procedures governing the
conduct of proceedings before the OHA and update pertinent filing information. They will be utilized by OHA in cases
that do not involve the former Federal petroleum price and allocation control regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) is a quasi-judicial body reporting to the Secretary of Energy. It is generally
responsible for conducting informal adjudicative proceedings of DOE where there is provision for separation of
functions, other than those which are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In
connection with these duties, OHA holds hearings, receives evidence, develops the record, and issues final agency
determinations, which are subject to review in the Federal courts. Except for regulations governing proceedings
before the Board of Contract Appeals and other transaction appeals boards in DOE, which are components of the Office
of Hearings and Appeals, procedural regulations governing OHA practice generally appear in part 205 of title 10 of
the Code of Federal Regulations. Part 205 is a part of chapter II, Subchapter A of the DOE regulations, and are designed
to apply to matters involving the former oil price and allocation control regulations which were in effect during
the period 1973 through 1981. Because those oil-related proceedings are winding down, and the OHA is conducting a
variety of other informal adjudications for the Department, it has become apparent that the OHA procedural regulations
should appear in chapter X of title 10, which contains the general provisions of DOE regulations. The rules will be
organized into a new part 1003 within chapter X. At the same time, procedures governing the conduct of proceedings
before the OHA have been streamlined, and pertinent filing information has been updated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Apart from general filing procedures, the regulations proposed today set forth OHA procedures for adjudicating
various applications, petitions, motions and related requests filed by the public. These regulations include procedures
for the filing of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Applications for Exception from DOE orders, regulations and rulings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Appeals of DOE orders; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Applications for Stay of DOE orders; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Motions for Modification or Rescission of OHA orders; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Requests for Conferences and Hearings before OHA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Petitions for Special Redress or Other Relief. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rules are not intended to grant by themselves any new authority to the Office of Hearings and Appeals to conduct
informal adjudications. They are designed to provide standard procedural rules that may be used to cover a variety
of situations that may be encountered by the many different programs that the Department implements. There are two
ways these regulations become effective. First, the procedures outlined in these rules become effective where program
rules specifically reference them and state that a member of the public can make a request for relief under these rules.
For example, the program regulations that the Department promulgated in the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer
Products states that any person receiving an order may file an appeal with the Office of Hearings and Appeals utilizing
that office's appellate rules. See 10 CFR 430.27(n). Similarly, in implementing the Payments-Equal-to-Taxes provisions
of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the Department stated that an entity may file an appeal with the Office of Hearings
and Appeals of a DOE payment equal to taxes (PETT) determination utilizing the OHA's 10 CFR part 205, subpart H appellate
rules. See Payments-Equal-To-Taxes Provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as Amended, Interpretation
and Procedures, as published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 27, 1991 (56 FR 42314). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, these rules may be effective where a statute requires the Department to provide procedures that permit the
public to seek redress, and the appropriate departmental official has delegated the responsibility to implement
that requirement to the Office of Hearings and Appeals. For example, section 504 of the Department of Energy Organization
Act requires the Secretary to provide for the making of adjustments to any rule, regulation or order issued under four
statutes_the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (since expired), the Federal Energy Administration Act,
the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974, and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act_as may be
necessary to prevent serious financial hardship, inequity, or unfair distribution of burdens. The Secretary has
delegated that responsibility to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, which promulgated rules by which members of
the public could seek an exception to rules, regulations or orders issued under the four named statutes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Despite the establishment of standard procedures in these rules, there may be situations where the Office of Hearings
and Appeals needs to use procedures specific to the particular needs of a program. In those situations, DOE program
regulations themselves contain procedures governing OHA proceedings conducted under authority of those particular
regulations, rather than a reference to OHA procedural rules. For example, the DOE Contractor Employee Protection
Program contains procedural rules governing OHA proceedings in 10 CFR part 708. Similarly, the Department has proposed
procedural rules governing OHA proceedings for determining eligibility for access to classified matter as a part
of 10 CFR part 710. Under these circumstances, the rules in the program rules would govern OHA proceedings in those
matters, and the rules in part 1003 would not apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the exception of the regulations governing the filing and adjudication of an Application for Exception, explained
below, the proposed rules correspond to nearly identical procedural rules contained in 10 CFR part 205, which were
promulgated in the 1970's to adjudicate matters relating to the federal oil regulations. Part 205 will continue to
be used only to adjudicate matters which relate specifically to the federal oil regulations. The new part 1003, proposed
today, shall be utilized for adjudicating all other matters under OHA's jurisdiction. For instance, the DOE will
modify &sect;430.27(n) of 10 CFR part 430 (DOE Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products) to provide that
an aggrieved person filing an appeal under that part shall proceed under subpart C of the new part 1003. The DOE will
also issue a conforming amendment to the interpretation and procedures implementing the Payments-Equal-to-Taxes
provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, to change the reference to the appellate procedures
that are available. Future rulemakings which invoke OHA's adjudicatory authority will refer to the rules contained
in part 1003 as the operative administrative process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations concerning the filing and adjudication of an Application for Exception have been revised and are contained
in 10 CFR part 1003, subpart B. Generally, an Application for Exception may be filed by a person seeking an exception
from or an adjustment to a DOE regulatory requirement, where such relief is authorized by the pertinent regulations
or underlying statute concerned. Similar to the regulations appearing in 10 CFR part 205, subpart D, the proposed
rules provide that an aggrieved person may file an Application for Exception from a DOE regulation on the basis that
the specific regulatory requirement results in a serious hardship, gross inequity or unfair distribution of burdens.
The proposed rules set forth in part 1003, subpart B, present a simpler procedure than part 205, subpart D, by (1) eliminating
the issuance of a Proposed Decision and Order and related procedures prior to issuance of a final Decision and Order,
and (2) providing for an administrative appeal of the final Decision and Order by an aggrieved party directly to OHA,
except in exception proceedings brought under section 504 of the DOE Act which will continue to be appealable to the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The proposed rules make the adjudication of Applications for Exception more
effective since they are more practicable than the more complex procedures of part 205, subpart D, which were formulated
in contemplation of the federal oil regulations.

II. Procedural Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order
12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was not subject
to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12778 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations
and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in section 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating
drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain
legal standards for affected legal conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also
instructed to make every reasonable effort that the rulemaking notice defines key terms, specifies the effect on
existing law, and describes any administrative proceeding to be available prior to judicial review and any provisions
for the exhaustion of administrative remedies. DOE certifies that these proposed rules meet the requirements of
section 2(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612 requires that regulations or rules be reviewed for direct effects on States, on the relationship
between the national government and the States, or in the distribution of power among various levels of government.
If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then Executive Order 12612 requires preparation of a federalism
assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating or implementing a regulation or rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's regulations do not affect any traditional State function. There are therefore no substantial direct effects
requiring evaluation or assessment under Executive Order 12612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations were reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any regulations that will have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, i.e., small businesses, small government jurisdictions.
The proposed regulatory amendment updates and gives greater flexibility to previously existing procedural regulations.
DOE therefore certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities, and the preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis is not warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No additional information and recordkeeping requirements are imposed by this rule (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rules are strictly procedural in nature. Preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental
impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is not required for such rules under Appendix A to subpart D of 10 CFR part 1021.

III. Opportunity for Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written views or arguments regarding the proposed amendment set forth in
this notice. Seven copies of these comments should be submitted to Marcia B. Carlson, Chief, Docket and Publications
Branch, Office of Hearings and Appeals, at the address shown in the beginning of this notice. The envelope and document
submitted should be identified with the designation ``Office of Hearings and Appeals Procedural Regulations.''
Comments may also be sent via electronic mail to an Office of Hearings and Appeals internet mail address, which is:
OHA@HQ.DOE.GOV. All comments received on or before the date specified in the beginning of this notice will be carefully
assessed and fully considered prior to publication of the proposed amendment as a final rule. All comments will be
available for public inspection and copying in the Office of Hearings and Appeals Public Reference Room, Room 1E&hyph;234,
telephone number (202) 586&hyph;8001, between 1:00 and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person submitting information which that person believes to be confidential and which may be exempt by law from
public disclosure should submit seven complete copies, as well as two copies from which the information claimed to
be confidential has been deleted. DOE reserves the right to determine confidential status of the information or data
and to treat it according to its determination. This procedure is set forth in 10 CFR 205.9, which will be superseded
by the proposed 1004.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve a substantial issue of fact or law and that the
proposed rule is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the Nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses.
Therefore, pursuant to section 501(c) (42 U.S.C. 7191(c)) of the DOE Organization Act (Pub. L. 95&hyph;91; 42 U.S.C.
7101 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 Purpose and scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This part establishes the procedures to be utilized and identifies the sanctions that are available in proceedings
before the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy. These procedures provide standard rules of
practice in a variety of informal adjudications when jurisdiction is vested in the Office of Hearings and Appeals.
The procedures contained in this part may generally be incorporated by reference in proceedings established by rule,
regulation or by specific designation, under statutory authority of the Department of Energy, which invoke the adjudicatory
authority of the Office of Hearings and Appeals. e.g., 10 CFR part 430 (DOE Energy Conservation Program for Consumer
Products). These rules do not apply in instances in which DOE regulations themselves contain procedures governing
OHA proceedings conducted under authority of those particular regulations. e.g., 10 CFR part 708 (DOE Contractor
Employee Protection Program).

(n) Any information furnished in response to an SRO shall be accompanied by the sworn certification under penalty
of perjury of the person to whom it was directed or his authorized agent who actually provides the information that:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A diligent effort has been made to provide all information required by the SRO; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All information furnished is true, complete, and correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If any document responsive to a subpoena is not produced or any information required by an SRO is not furnished,
the certification shall include a statement setting forth every reason for failing to comply with the subpoena or
SRO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(o) If a person to whom a subpoena or SRO is directed withholds any document or information because of a claim of attorney-client
or other privilege, the person submitting the certification required by paragraph (m) or (n) of this section also
shall submit a written list of the documents or the information withheld indicating a description of each document
or information, the date of the document, each person shown on the document as having received a copy of the document,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(q) A witness whose testimony is recorded may procure a copy of his testimony by making a written request for a copy and
paying the appropriate fees. However, the Director may deny the request for good cause. Upon proper identification,
any witness or his attorney has the right to inspect the official transcript of the witness' own testimony. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(r) The Director may sequester any person subpoenaed to furnish documents or give testimony. Unless permitted by

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(s) A witness whose testimony is taken may be accompanied, represented and advised by his attorney as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Upon the initiative of the attorney or witness, the attorney may advise his client, in confidence, with respect
to the question asked his client, and if the witness refuses to answer any question, the witness or his attorney is required
to briefly state the legal grounds for such refusal; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the witness claims a privilege to refuse to answer a question on the grounds of self-incrimination, the witness
must assert the privilege personally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(t) The Director shall take all necessary action to regulate the course of testimony and to avoid delay and prevent
or restrain contemptuous or obstructionist conduct or contemptuous language. OHA may take actions as the circumstances
may warrant in regard to any instances where any attorney refuses to comply with directions or provisions of this section.

Request for confidential treatment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If any person filing a document with the OHA claims that some or all of the information contained in the document
is exempt from the mandatory public disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), is information
referred to in 18 U.S.C. 1905, or is otherwise exempt by law from public disclosure, and if such person requests the
OHA not to disclose such information, such person shall file together with the document two copies of the document
from which has been deleted the information for which such person wishes to claim confidential treatment. The person
shall indicate in the original document that it is confidential or contains confidential information and must file
a statement specifying the justification for non-disclosure of the information for which confidential treatment
is claimed. If the person states that the information comes within the exception codified at 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) for
trade secrets and commercial or financial information, such person shall include a statement specifying why such
information is privileged or confidential. If the person filing a document does not submit two copies of the document
with the confidential information deleted, the OHA may assume that there is no objection to public disclosure of the
document in its entirety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

specified in 10 CFR 1004.11. Notice of the decision by the OHA to deny such claim, in whole or in part, and an opportunity
to respond shall be given to a person claiming confidentiality of information no less than five days prior to its public
disclosure.

(a)(1) OHA may initiate an investigation of any statement in an application and utilize in its evaluation any relevant
facts obtained by such investigation. The OHA may solicit and accept submissions from third persons relevant to any
application provided that the applicant is afforded an opportunity to respond to all third person submissions. In
evaluating an application, the OHA may consider any other source of information. The OHA on its own initiative may
convene a hearing or conference, if, in its discretion, it considers that such hearing or conference will advance
its evaluation of the application. The OHA may issue appropriate orders as warranted in the proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the OHA determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision and if upon request additional
information is not submitted by the applicant, the OHA may dismiss the application without prejudice. If the failure
to supply additional information is repeated or willful, the OHA may dismiss the application with prejudice. If the
applicant fails to provide the notice required by &sect;1003.23, the OHA may dismiss the application without prejudice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) The OHA shall consider an application for an exception only when it determines that a more appropriate proceeding
is not provided by DOE regulations.

distribution of burdens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An application for an exception shall be decided in a manner that is, to the extent possible, consistent with the

(a)(1) The OHA may initiate an investigation of any statement in an appeal and utilize in its evaluation any relevant
facts obtained by such investigation. The OHA may solicit and accept submissions from third persons relevant to any
appeal provided that the appellant is afforded an opportunity to respond to all third person submissions. In evaluating
an appeal, the OHA may consider any other source of information. The OHA on its own initiative may convene a conference

(a) The application shall contain a full and complete statement of all relevant facts pertaining to the circumstances,
act or transaction that is the subject of the application and to the OHA action sought. Such facts shall include the
names and addresses of all affected persons (if reasonably ascertainable); a complete statement of the business
or other reasons that justify the act or transaction; a description of the acts or transactions that would be affected
by the requested action; and a full description of the pertinent provisions and relevant facts contained in any relevant

be included with the application. When the application pertains to only one step of a larger integrated transaction,
the facts, circumstances, and other relevant information pertaining to the entire transaction shall be submitted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The applicant shall state whether he requests or intends to request that there be a conference regarding the application.
Any request not made at the time the application is filed shall be made as soon thereafter as possible, to insure that
the conference is held when it will be most beneficial. The request and the OHA's determination regarding it shall
be made in accordance with subpart F of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The applicant shall fully describe the events, acts, or transactions that comprise the significantly changed
circumstances, as defined in &sect;1003.55(b)(2), upon which the application is based. The applicant shall state

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) The OHA may initiate an investigation of any statement in an application and utilize in its evaluation any relevant
facts obtained by such investigation. The OHA may solicit and accept submissions from third persons relevant to any
application for modification or rescission provided that the applicant is afforded an opportunity to respond to
all third person submissions. In evaluating an application for modification or rescission, the OHA may convene a
conference, on its own initiative, if, in its discretion, it considers that such conference will advance its evaluation
of the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the OHA determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision and if upon request the
necessary additional information is not submitted, the OHA may dismiss the application without prejudice. If the
failure to supply additional information is repeated or willful, the OHA may dismiss the application with prejudice.
If the applicant fails to provide the notice required by &sect;1003.53, the OHA may dismiss the application without
prejudice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) An application for modification or rescission of an order shall be processed only if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The application demonstrates that it is based on significantly changed circumstances; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The period within which a person may file an appeal has lapsed or, if an appeal has been filed, a final order has been
issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of this subpart, the term ``significantly changed circumstances'' shall mean_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The discovery of material facts that were not known or could not have been known at the time of the proceeding and
action upon which the application is based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The discovery of a law, regulation, interpretation, ruling, order or decision on appeal or exception that was
in effect at the time of the proceeding upon which the application is based and which, if such had been made known to the
OHA, would have been relevant to the proceeding and would have substantially altered the outcome; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) There has been a substantial change in the facts or circumstances upon which an outstanding and continuing order
of the OHA affecting the applicant was issued, which change has occurred during the interval between issuance of such
order and the date of the application and was caused by forces or circumstances beyond the control of the applicant.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart establishes the procedures for requesting and conducting an OHA conference or hearing. Such proceedings
shall be convened in the discretion of the OHA, consistent with OHA requirements.

 Conferences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The OHA in its discretion may direct that a conference be convened, on its own initiative or upon request by a person,
when it appears that such conference will materially advance the proceeding. The determination as to who may attend
a conference convened under this subpart shall be in the discretion of the OHA, but a conference will usually not be
open to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A conference may be requested in connection with any proceeding of the OHA by any person who might be aggrieved by
that proceeding. The request may be made in writing or verbally, but must include a specific showing as to why such conference
will materially advance the proceeding. The request shall be addressed to the OHA, as provided in &sect;1003.11.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A conference may only be convened after actual notice of the time, place and nature of the conference is provided
to the person who requested the conference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When a conference is convened in accordance with this section, each person may present views as to the issues involved.
Documentary evidence may be presented at the conference, but will be treated as if submitted in the regular course
of the proceeding. A transcript of the conference will not usually be prepared. However, the OHA in its discretion
may have a verbatim transcript prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Because a conference is solely for the exchange of views incident to a proceeding, there will be no formal reports
or findings unless the OHA in its discretion determines that such would be advisable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The OHA in its discretion may direct that a hearing be convened on its own initiative or upon request by a person,
when it appears that such hearing will materially advance the proceeding. The determination as to who may attend a
hearing convened under this subpart shall be in the discretion of OHA, but a hearing will usually be open to the public.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A hearing may be requested by an applicant, appellant, or any other person who might be aggrieved by the OHA action
sought. The request shall be in writing and shall include a specific showing as to why such hearing will materially
advance the proceeding. The request shall be addressed to the OHA at the address provided in &sect;1003.11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The OHA will designate an agency official to conduct the hearing, and will specify the time and place for the hearing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) A hearing may only be convened after actual notice of the time, place, and nature of the hearing is provided both
to the applicant or appellant and to any other person readily identifiable by the OHA as one who will be aggrieved by
the OHA action involved. The notice shall include, as appropriate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A statement that such person may participate in the hearing; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A statement that such person may request a separate conference or hearing regarding the application or appeal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When a hearing is convened in accordance with this section, each person may present views as to the issue or issues
involved. Documentary evidence may be presented at the hearing, but will be treated as if submitted in the regular
course of the proceeding. A transcript of the hearing will usually be prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If material factual issues remain in dispute after an application or appeal has been filed, the Director of the
OHA or his designee may issue an order convening an evidentiary hearing in which witnesses shall testify under oath,
subject to cross-examination, for the record and in the presence of a Presiding Officer. A Motion for Evidentiary
Hearing should specify the type of witness or witnesses whose testimony is sought, the scope of questioning that is
anticipated, and the relevance of the questioning to the proceeding. A motion may be summarily denied for lack of sufficient
specificity, because it would place an undue burden on another person or the DOE or because it will cause undue delay.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) A Motion for Evidentiary Hearing must be served on any person from whom information is sought. Any person who wishes
to respond to a Motion for Evidentiary Hearing must do so within ten days of service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) In reaching a decision with respect to a request for a hearing or motion filed under this subpart, the OHA shall consider
all relevant information in the record. If an order is issued granting a hearing or evidentiary hearing, in whole or
in part, the order shall specify the parties, any limitations on the participation of a party, and the issues to be considered.
An order of the OHA issued under this section is an interlocutory order which is subject to further administrative
review or appeal only upon issuance of a final Decision and Order in the proceeding concerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) All hearings convened pursuant to this subpart shall be conducted by the Director of the OHA or his designee. At
any hearing, the parties shall have the opportunity to present material evidence that directly relates to a particular
issue set forth for hearing. The Presiding Officer may administer oaths or affirmations, rule on objections to the
presentation of evidence, receive relevant material, require the advance submission of documents offered as evidence,
dispose of procedural requests, determine the format of the hearing, modify any order granting a Motion for Evidentiary
Hearing, direct that written motions, documents or briefs be filed with respect to issues raised during the course
of the hearing, ask questions of witnesses, issue subpoenas, direct that documentary evidence be served upon other
parties (under protective order if such evidence is deemed confidential) and otherwise regulate the conduct of the
hearing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces the reopening of the comment period for the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) No. 94&hyph;12,
Type Certificates for Surplus Aircraft of the Armed Forces. The reopening of the comment period responds to requests
by some members of Congress and several companies in the aircraft industry for additional time for the public to comment
on the proposal. Because of the unanticipated public interest in the proposed rule change, the FAA has decided to provide
the public additional time to develop and submit comments responsive to the NPRM.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On April 21, 1994, the FAA issued Notice 94&hyph;12, entitled ``Type Certificates for Surplus Aircraft of the Armed
Forces'' (59 FR 19114, April 21, 1994) proposing changes that would remove the regulations for issuing type certificates
for surplus aircraft of the Armed Forces. The purpose of the proposed removal is to eliminate references to obsolete
airworthiness standards that are no longer appropriate for type certification of surplus airworthiness standards
that are no longer appropriate for type certification of surplus military aircraft. Surplus aircraft of the Armed
Forces may still be certificate in normal, utility, acrobatic, commuter, transport, and restricted categories
when compliance with the applicable regulations is shown. This proposal, if a adopted as final, would become effective
on April 21, 1994, and is intended to provide a greater level of assurance that the appropriate airworthiness standards
are met before standard airworthiness certificates are issued for surplus military aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several telephone and written requests received between June 13 and 14, 1994, asked that the comment period be extended
for up to 60 days. In view of these comments and the unanticipated level of public interest in the proposed rule change,
the comment period for this notice needs to be reopened to accommodate the requests. Copies of the written requests
are available in the docket.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has determined that the reopening of the comment period will allow several companies in the aircraft industry
additional time for a more thorough review of applicable issues and questions raised by the NPRM, and the drafting
of responsive comments. Accordingly, the FAA finds that it is in the public interest to reopen the comment period until
August 26, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the on-going regulatory review of its rules and guides, the Commission on May 6, 1994 published requests
for public comments concerning three related sets of regulations: (1) Rules and Regulations under the Wool Products
Labeling Act, (2) Rules and Regulations under the Fur Products Labeling Act, and (3) Rules and Regulations under the
Textile Fiber Products Identification Act. The comments were to be accepted until June 6, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has received letters seeking extension of these comment periods from the American Textile Manufacturers
Institute and the National Knitwear &amp; Sportswear Association. Both trade associations represent large numbers
of interested members subject to the marking requirements of the Textile, Wool, and Fur Acts. In addition to these
formal requests for extension, Commission staff has been contacted by other trade associations, individual companies,
and interested entities who intend to comment or would like to comment and have stated that, because of the widespread
coverage and complexity of these regulations, the comment periods should be extended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To allow all interested persons the opportunity to supply information to the Commission, the Commission hereby extends
the period within which to comment on its Rules and Regulations under the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939, until
September 6, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the on-going regulatory review of its rules and guides, the Commission on May 6, 1994 published requests
for public comments concerning three related sets of regulations: (1) Rules and Regulations under the Wool Products
Labeling Act, (2) Rules and Regulations under the Fur Products Labeling Act, and (3) Rules and Regulations under the
Textile Fiber Products Identification Act. The comments were to be accepted until June 6, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has received letters seeking extension of these comment periods from the American Textile Manufacturers
Institute and the National Knitwear &amp; Sportswear Association. Both trade associations represent large numbers
of interested members subject to the marking requirements of the Textile, Wool, and Fur Acts. In addition to these
formal requests for extension, Commission staff has been contacted by other trade associations, individual companies,
and interested entities who intend to comment or would like to comment and have stated that, because of the widespread
coverage and complexity of these regulations, the comment periods should be extended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To allow all interested persons the opportunity to supply information to the Commission, the Commission hereby extends
the period within which to comment on its Rules and Regulations under the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act
until September 6, 1994.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 15, 1994, the Commission solicited comments on proposed amendments to the net capital rule relating to capital
charges for listed options and related positions.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In the release, the Commission also solicited comments on the applicability of the proposed theoretical pricing
haircut methodology to assess the market risk for over-the-counter (``OTC'') options. The Commission requested
that comments be received on or before May 16, 1994.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Commission already has received several letters commenting on the release. Broker-dealers, however, have requested
from the staff of the Division of Market Regulation an extension of the comment period. Specifically, industry members
have requested additional time to respond to the Commission's request for comments relating to the net capital treatment
of OTC options.

II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Commission appreciates the complexity of the issues addressed by the Commission's proposed amendments to the
net capital rule, particularly with respect to OTC options. Therefore, in order to receive additional serious and
well-reasoned responses from the industry participants, the Commission is extending the comment period for all
commenters to September 16, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the Commission is eager to address these important issues in a timely fashion. Accordingly, the Commission
staff will continue to develop rulemaking in this area while it is awaiting further responses from the industry.

The Department of the Army is proposing changes to 32 CFR Part 553 in accordance with section 1176 of the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub. L. 103&hyph;160. That Section extended eligibility for interment in
Arlington National Cemetery to any former prisoner of war who, while a prisoner of war, served honorably in the active
military, naval, or air service and who dies on or after the date of enactment of the 1994 Authorization Act (November
30, 1993).

This proposed rule governs eligibility for interment in Arlington National Cemetery, an Army national cemetery
which is under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army. Because the proposed rule pertains to a military function
of the Department of the Army, the provisions of Executive Order 12866 do not apply. It is hereby certified that this
proposed rule will not have a significant impact on small business or governments in the area.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corps seeks comments on a tentative proposal to change its rules regarding permits for the placement of temporary
anchors, cables and chains for floating or semisubmersible drilling rigs within shipping safety fairways. Shipping
safety fairways and anchorages are established on the Outer Continental Shelf by the U.S. Coast Guard to provide unobstructed
approaches for vessels using U.S. ports. This initiative arises as a result of requests by offshore oil companies
for exemptions to the provisions of the rule because drilling and production technologies have greatly extended
the range of deepwater drilling and the limits placed on temporary structures allowed within fairway boundaries
may no longer be reasonable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Department of the Army permits are required for the construction of any structure in or over any navigable water of
the United States pursuant to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 U.S.C. 403). This authority
was extended to artificial islands and fixed structures located on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) by Section 4(f)
of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (67 Stat. 463; 43 U.S.C. 1333(f)).

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the cited authorities, the Corps promulgated regulations in 33 CFR 209.135 establishing shipping safety
fairways in the Gulf of Mexico to provide obstruction-free routes for vessels in approaches to United States ports.
The Corps provided these obstruction-free routes by denying permits for structures within certain designated lanes.
In 1978, the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (PWSA), was amended to delegate authority to the Department of Transportation
and the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard to establish vessel routing measures, including fairways and fairway anchorages.
In accordance with the PWSA, the Coast Guard completed the required studies and published final rules establishing
shipping safety fairways on May 13, 1982. The Corps subsequently revoked its fairway regulations in &sect;209.135(d)
but retained paragraph (b), which contained the conditions under which the nationwide permit for oil exploration
and production structures on the OCS (33 CFR 330.5(a)(8)), was issued. On November 13, 1986, the fairway regulations
were repromulgated in 33 CFR 322.5(l) to consolidate all permit regulations for structures in the same part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the regulations allowing temporary structures within fairways were promulgated by the Corps in 1981, deepwater
drilling occurred in water depths of 300 to 600 feet. At that time, the limitation of 120 days that temporary anchors
would be allowed within fairways was considered reasonable. If the exploratory well was successful, a conventional
fixed production platform would be used and there would be no further need to maintain the anchors within the fairway.
According to offshore hydrocarbon exploration and production companies, the existing technology has extended
the range of deepwater drilling to water depths of 1,000 to 4,000 feet. As a result, drilling times have increased and
production methods have changed. Today, the limitation on the length of time (120 days), that an anchor is allowed
within a fairway is no longer appropriate, particularly in water depths in excess of 600 feet. The industry has available
many different types of production platforms, including floating production systems that are anchored in place
during the productive life of the reserves and then moved to a new location. In water depths greater than 600 feet, the
floating production platform becomes an important production option and in water depths greater than 1,000 feet
these units are essential. In many instances, the only obstacle to using this type of system to drill and produce hydocarbons
is the location of a fairway. Current regulations require that the production system be placed a great distance from
the fairway in order to keep the anchors clear of the fairway. The result is that there are many hydrocarbon bearing
lease areas that cannot be effectively penetrated and produced. It should be noted that if one of the following proposals
is adopted, the requirement that the rig must be situated as necessary to insure that the minimum clearance over an
anchor line within a fairway is 125 feet, will not be changed, unless we find that an individual permit is required and
the minimum clearance over an anchor line would be determined on a case-by-case basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8 to eliminate the authorization for all anchors and cables and chains associated with oil and gas drilling and production
in water depths greater than 600 feet within fairways. This would result in the requirement that the activities occurring
in water depths greater than 600 feet would be subject to the Corps individual permit procedures. The nationwide permit
in 33 CFR 330 would continue to apply to those activities in waters less than 600 feet in depth, without any changes to
the regulations.

This ANPRM seeks comments on a tentative proposal that may be further pursued through informal rulemaking based in
part on comments received. This ANPRM does not establish any requirements but is rather a voluntary action intended
to collect information regarding whether to pursue rulemaking on this issue. Therefore, no economic impact assessment
has been prepared. The Corps will provide all regulatory analyses and notices, as appropriate, for any future rulemakings
on this subject.

 (golden paintbrush), a perennial herb in the snapdragon family, once occurred from the Willamette Valley in Oregon
north to Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. Only ten disjunct populations of this plant now exist, in open
grasslands ranging from south of Olympia, Thurston County, Washington; north through the Puget Trough to southwest
British Columbia, Canada. Threats to the species include competition with encroaching native and alien plant species,
habitat modification through succession in the absence of fire, predation, and stochastic (random) events, such
as catastrophic fire. Commercial and residential development also threaten this species. The plant occurs on Federal,
State, and privately owned land.

the Service now extends the comment period for a period of 30 days until August 11, 1994.

 This proposed rule would implement the rulemaking required by section 919 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992. Section 919 requires the Secretary of HUD to issue ``rules defining what are `significant facilities
and services especially designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons' required under section 807(b)(2)
of the Fair Housing Act to meet the definition of the term `housing for older persons' in such section.'' This rule would
amend existing regulations governing ``housing for older persons'', to provide the definitions required by section
919.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Right Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988,
42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;19) exempts ``housing for older persons'' from the prohibitions against discrimination because
of familial status. The purpose of the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of familial status and the
``housing for older persons'' exemption is to protect families with children from discrimination in housing without
unfairly limiting housing choices for elderly persons (see 134 Cong. Rec. S 19722 (Aug. 1, 1988) statement of Senator
Karnes). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 23, 1989 (54 FR 3232), HUD published a final rule implementing the Fair Housing Act. This rule included regulations
governing housing for older persons. The ``housing for older persons'' regulations implement, among other things,
section 807(b)(2)(C) of the Fair Housing Act, which exempts housing intended and operated for occupancy by at least
one person 55 years of age or older per unit that satisfies certain criteria. These regulations are codified in 24 CFR
part 100, subpart E. In drafting the housing for older persons regulations, HUD took into consideration the public
comments that addressed the issue of what constitutes ``significant facilities and services specifically designed
to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress mandated that, in determining whether housing qualifies as housing for persons 55 years of age or older,
the Secretary develop regulations which require at least the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The existence of significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs
of older persons, or if the provision of such facilities is not practicable, that such housing is necessary to provide
important housing opportunities for older persons; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That at least 80 percent of the units are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The publication of, and adherence to, policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent by the owner or manager
to provide housing for persons 55 years of age or older.

Section 919 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992
(the 1992 Act)), requires the Secretary of HUD to issue rules further defining what are ``significant facilities
and services especially designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons'' required under section 807(b)(2)
of the Fair Housing Act to meet the definition of the term ``housing for older persons.''

 This proposed rule would implement the rulemaking required by section 919 of the 1992 Act. Specifically, this proposed
rule would revise the ``55 or over'' housing regulation, codified at 24 CFR 100.304.

This proposed rule would expound upon the significant facilities and services requirements governing ``55 or over
housing'' currently set forth in &sect;100.304(b)(1). A new &sect;100.305 would be added and would address the requirements
for ``facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.'' A new
&sect;100.306 would be added and would address the requirement that such facilities and services be ``significant.''
In addition to adding these two new sections, the substance of existing &sect;100.304(b)(2) would be located in the
new &sect;100.310. Existing subsections &sect;&sect;100.304(c)(1) and 100.304(d) and 100.304(e) would provide
the substance of new &sect;100.315, and existing &sect;100.304(c)(2) would be redesignated as new &sect;100.316.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing this proposed regulation, the Department desires to provide as much certainty as possible regarding
the determination that housing qualifies as housing for older persons. It has sought to structure the regulation
to allow both housing providers and protected classes alike to ascertain with confidence whether a community qualifies
under the Fair Housing Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, it is the Department's view that a single, precise, mathematical-like standard that fully implements the
Act is not possible, nor may it be equitable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, the Department has concluded that a flexible standard is necessary in order to reflect regional variations
in services and facilities that distinguish housing for older persons from other similar housing, as well variations
determined by the geography of the site or by the differences in the nature or cost of the housing in question. To do otherwise
could unnecessarily restrict housing opportunities for older persons by holding all housing to a single arbitrary
standard that was not intended by the framers of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Services common to older persons in one region of the country are often not commonly provided or expected in another
where weather, for example, or terrain make them unnecessary or undesirable. Similarly, facilities expected as
the norm at large, single family older community developments may not be expected at small, mobile home parks with
limited acreage, or at large, multi-story, multi-family condominium complexes. And services or facilities common
or needed in urban communities near transportation may differ substantially from those appropriate to rural locations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department recognizes that housing for older persons is not limited to the affluent. Therefore,
the Department is concerned lest a single standard that offers certainty would not be sufficiently flexible to accommodate
housing for low and moderate income older persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In structuring the proposed rule which follows, the Department has sought to identify as many as possible of the factors
and considerations which are germane to capture the differences required by housing for older persons, thus making
it possible for wide varieties of communities to qualify who meet the statutory requirements of the Act. In addition,
through the publication of the appendix and the illustrative examples it contains, the Department has sought to provide
further guidance to assist in the application of the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Department specifically requests detailed comment on how the proposed standards can be modified to
provide greater certainty and precision while still providing the flexibility necessary to accommodate the other
factors essential to carry out the Act. To allow for this, the Department has extended the comment period to 90 days
and will provide for a public hearing process, described elsewhere in the preamble, to receive public comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is the case with other exemptions to civil rights statutes and other exemptions under the Fair Housing Act (the Act),
the exemption to the Act's requirements provided by the ``housing for older persons'' exemption will be interpreted
narrowly. A narrow construction of this exemption is intended to give full force and effect to the protection against
familial status discrimination afforded by the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The burden of demonstrating that the ``older persons'' exemption applies rests on the party asserting the exemption.
Part of that party's burden in establishing qualification for the exemption requires affirmatively demonstrating
through credible and objective evidence that the requirements for the exemption exist as of the date of an alleged
violation of the Act or at any time that the exemption is asserted as a basis for allowing a practice that would otherwise
be prohibited as discriminatory on the basis of familial status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the Fair Housing Act imposes a strict burden upon a person claiming the exemption to provide
credible and objective evidence showing that the facilities and services offered by the housing provider were designed,
constructed or adapted to meet the particularized needs of older persons. In order to be considered as sufficient
to qualify a housing facility for the exemption, the evidence must show that the housing in question is clearly distinguished
from the bulk of other housing (except for other older persons' housing) in a particular area, by the existence of those
facilities and services which set the housing facility apart as housing intended for and operated as housing for older
persons. Absent such evidence, the familial status prohibitions of the Act will apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no indication in the Act or in its legislative history that Congress intended that only the most expensive
housing with the most expansive and expensive facilities and services, should qualify for the exemption. Housing
in all affordable categories may offer the types of facilities and services for older persons which make that housing
unique for the class of persons who can afford that housing. This determination is made by contrasting the housing
being offered as housing for older persons to comparable housing not claiming the exemption and evaluating the significance
of the facilities and services being offered to meet the requirements of the exemption (See &sect;100.306(c)(l);
Comparable housing is of similar type, size and cost of lease or purchase.)

New &sect;100.306 proposes to set forth the criteria by which facilities or services that meet the requirements of
&sect;100.305 (i.e., specifically designed facilities and services) will be determined to be ``significant.''
The factors listed in new &sect;100.306 are intended to measure the relative importance of the facilities and services
so that their significance can be determined. New &sect;100.306 would approach the ``significance'' determination
as an aggregate one_that is, a determination with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to all facilities and services as a whole, rather than a determination with respect to each facility and service individually.

III. Appendix
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD is also proposing to publish an Appendix to the proposed rule. This Appendix is intended to provide members of the
public with detailed guidance interpreting the provisions of the Fair Housing Act that pertain to the exemption for
``housing for older persons'' (55 or over housing). The Department believes that supplementing the regulatory language
with interpretive guidance in the Appendix is the best way to comply with the Congressional mandate to further define
the term ``significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older
persons.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends for the Appendix to serve as guidance for housing providers and others in determining whether
housing qualifies for the ``housing for older persons'' exemption (55 or over housing). The Appendix illustrates
the application of the factors that the Department will consider in making its determination. The Department will
refer to the interpretive guidance in the Appendix when considering whether there is reasonable cause to believe
that a discriminatory practice has occurred or is about to occur. It should be clearly understood, however, that the
illustrative examples provided in this Appendix are not dispositive of any actual case; i.e., a bare claim by a housing
provider that the operation of a particular housing development duplicates the fact pattern of any example presented
in this Appendix will not preclude the Department from conducting an investigation under the Fair Housing Act of an
alleged discriminatory housing practice directed against an aggrieved person with familial status; nor will it
preclude the Secretary from issuing a determination based upon the evidence obtained through such an investigation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will apply the criteria for ``specifically designed'' and ``significant'' facilities and services
on a case-by-case basis, and a determination will be based upon the totality of the factual circumstances examined.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department may revise or supplement the Appendix from time to time in order to incorporate additional guidance,
fact patterns, and relevant Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and court decisions that reflect future developments
in administrative and case law. This will be accomplished through the publication of formal notices in the

A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, which implements section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). This
Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the
Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development Room

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this proposed rule
before publication and, by approving it, certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The proposed rule would implement section 919 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992, which requires the Secretary of HUD to further define the term ``significant facilities and services
specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.'' The Department anticipates that the
proposed rule will have an impact on some small housing providers. However, the number of small housing providers
affected is not considered to be so great as to constitute a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities.

 has determined that this proposed rule would not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions,
or on their relationship with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among
the various levels of government. The Fair Housing Act, and section 919 of the Housing and Community Development Act
of 1992 direct HUD to provide further guidance on the meaning significant facilities and services so that States,
local governments, and housing providers will have a better understanding of what housing is exempt from the Fair
Housing Act's prohibition against discrimination on the basis of familial status.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) With reference to complaints filed pursuant to the Act, this means that the person or entity claiming the exemption
must affirmatively demonstrate through credible and objective evidence as of the date of the alleged violation of
the Act or at any time that the exemption is asserted as a basis for allowing a practice that would otherwise be prohibited
as discriminatory on the basis of familial status that the housing meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this

by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that the person or entity asserting the exemption affirmatively
demonstrates through credible and objective evidence that the housing has facilities and services specifically
designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons. In order to satisfy this paragraph, there must be more
than one facility and more than one service specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.
Both facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons must exist
as of the date of an alleged violation of the Act or at any time that the exemption is asserted as a basis for allowing a
practice that would otherwise be prohibited as discriminatory on the basis of familial status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) In determining that a facility or service is ``specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of
older persons,'' the Department will first consider whether the facility or service is readily accessible to and
usable by older persons with mobility, visual and hearing impairments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the housing is a covered multifamily dwelling as defined in 24 CFR 100.201 constructed for first occupancy and
use after March 13, 1991, in order for a facility to satisfy &sect;100.305(b)(1) it must meet the requirements of &sect;100.205.
In order for a service to satisfy &sect;100.305(b)(1), the Department will consider whether older persons with mobility,
visual and hearing impairments occupying units can readily access and use the service and the extent to which the service
is designed to meet the mobility, visual and hearing impairments of an aging population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the housing is not a covered multifamily dwelling as defined in 24 CFR 100.201 constructed for first occupancy
after March 13, 1991, in order for a facility or service to satisfy &sect;100.305(b)(1), the Department will consider
whether older persons with mobility, visual and hearing impairments occupying units can readily access and use the
facility or service, and the extent to which the facility or service is designed to meet the mobility, visual and hearing
impairments of an aging population. However, if the facility meets the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines for
new construction (24 CFR Ch. 1, Subch. A, App. II), the facility will satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are met, the Department will consider such factors as the
following as relevant in determining whether a facility or service is ``specifically designed to meet the physical
or social needs of older persons'': 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The extent to which the facility or service benefits the current and future health, safety or leisure needs of an
aging population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whether a housing provider has published and adhered to policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent
by the housing provider not only to comply with all requirements of law governing discrimination against persons
with disabilities, but, even in circumstances not otherwise required by law, to make, at the housing provider's expense,
reasonable alterations, modifications and accommodations to facilities and services to make them accessible to
persons with disabilities who become or who are residents. The policies and procedures must ensure that as the needs
of older persons currently residing in the housing change and as new residents move into the housing, the housing provider
will respond to those changing needs. A statement of these policies and procedures shall be provided to residents
and applicants for housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The extent to which the housing provider has taken meaningful steps to make available an off-site facility or
service which would otherwise be unavailable to older persons who are residents of the housing facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The extent to which a service, or services, specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older
persons is provided in connection with the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The types of facilities and services provided in the section 202 ``Supportive Housing for the Elderly'' Program
(see 24 CFR part 889) are the types of facilities and services that would meet the physical or social needs of older persons
in general. However, these do not constitute the exclusive set of facilities and services that the Department will
consider in determining whether a facility or service is ``specifically designed'' to meet the physical or social
needs of older persons.

demonstrates through credible and objective evidence that the facilities and services specifically designed to
meet the physical or social needs of older persons are ``significant''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In determining whether the facilities and services offered as specifically designed to meet the physical or social
needs of older persons are significant, the Department will consider, in the aggregate, all facilities and services
that meet the requirements of &sect;100.305. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Department will evaluate each facility or service that meets the requirements of &sect;100.305 by the following
criteria to determine whether the facilities in the aggregate and the services in the aggregate are ``significant'':

(1) The extent to which a facility or service offered by a housing provider to residents is not customarily offered
to residents of comparable housing (other than housing for older persons) in the relevant geographic area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The extent to which a facility or service can accommodate the older population of the housing facility. The capacity
of each facility or service specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons depends upon,
but is not limited to, such factors as:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The size of the facility or scope of the service offered;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The frequency with which the facility is made available or the service is offered; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Whether the facility or service is offered only at one location or there are a number of locations at which the facility
is made available or at which the service is offered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The extent to which the facility or service is of benefit to older persons, given the climate and physical setting
of the housing facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The extent to which a facility or service is actually used by older persons who are residents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The extent to which the facility or service is provided by the housing provider rather than by others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing intended and operated for occupancy
by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that the person or entity affirmatively demonstrates
through credible and objective evidence that the housing satisfies the requirements of &sect;&sect;100.305, 100.306,
100.315 and 100.316 or &sect;&sect;100.310, 100.315 and 100.316. Housing satisfies the requirements of this section
&sect;100.310 if it is not practicable to provide significant facilities and services designed to meet the physical
or social needs of older persons and the housing facility is necessary to provide important housing opportunities
for older persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In order to satisfy the requirements of &sect;100.310 the owner or manager must affirmatively demonstrate through
credible and objective evidence that the provision of significant facilities and services designed to meet the physical
or social needs of older persons would result in depriving older persons in the relevant geographic area of needed
and desired housing. The following factors, among others, are relevant in meeting the requirements of &sect;100.310.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether the owner or manager of the housing facility has endeavored to provide significant facilities and services
designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons either by the owner or by some other entity. Demonstrating
that such services and facilities are expensive to provide is not alone sufficient to demonstrate that the provision
of such services is not practicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The amount of rent charged, if the dwellings are rented, or the price of the dwellings, if they are offered for sale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The income range of the residents of the housing facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The demand for housing for older persons in the relevant geographic area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The range of housing choices for older persons within the relevant geographic area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The availability of other similarly priced housing for older persons in the relevant geographic area. If similarly
priced housing for older persons with significant facilities and services is reasonably available in the relevant
geographic area then the housing facility does not meet the requirements of &sect;100.310 .
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The vacancy rate of the housing facility.

(a) The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing intended and operated for occupancy
by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that the person or entity affirmatively demonstrates
through credible and objective evidence that housing satisfies the requirements of &sect;&sect;100.305, 100.306,
100.315 and 100.316 or 100.310, 100.315 and 100.316. Housing satisfies the requirements of &sect;100.315 if at least
80 percent of the units in the housing facility are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit except
that a newly constructed housing facility for first occupancy after March 12, 1989 need not comply with &sect;100.315
until 25 percent of the units in the facility are occupied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Housing satisfies the requirements of this section even though:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) On September 13, 1988, under 80 percent of the occupied units in the housing facility are occupied by at least one
person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that at least 80 percent of the units that are occupied by new occupants
after September 13, 1988 are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There are unoccupied units, provided that at least 80 percent of such units are reserved for occupancy by at least
one person 55 years of age or over.

Example 1: A. John and Mary apply for housing at the Valley Heights apartment complex which is a 100 unit housing complex
that is operated for persons 55 years of age or older in accordance with all the requirements of this section. John is
56 years of age. Mary is 50 years of age. Eighty (80) units are occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older.
Eighteen (18) units are occupied exclusively by persons who are under 55. Among the units occupied by new occupants
after September 13, 1988 were 18 units occupied exclusively by persons who are under 55. Two (2) units are vacant. At
the time John and Mary apply for housing, Valley Heights qualifies for the ``55 or over'' exemption because 82% of the
occupied units (80/98) at Valley Heights are occupied by at least one person 55 years old or older. If John and Mary are
accepted for occupancy, then 81 out of the 99 occupied units (82%) will be occupied by at least one person who is 55 years
of age or older and Valley Heights will continue to qualify for the ``55 or over'' exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. If only 78 out of the 98 occupied units had been occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older, Valley Heights
would still qualify for the exemption, but could not rent to John or Mary if they were both under 55 without losing the
exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Example 2: Green Meadow is a 1,000 unit retirement community that provides significant facilities and services specifically
designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons. On September 13, 1988, Green Meadow published and thereafter
adhered to policies and procedures demonstrating an intent to provide housing for persons 55 years of age or older.
On September 13, 1988, 100 units were vacant and 300 units were occupied only by people who were under 55 years old. Consequently,
on September 13, 1988 67% of the Green Meadow's occupied units (600 out of 900) were occupied by at least one person 55
years of age or older. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, Green Meadow qualifies for the ``55 or over'' exemption
even though, on September 13, 1988, under 80% of the occupied units in the housing facility were occupied by at least
one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that at least 80% of the units that were occupied after September
13, 1988 are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older. Under paragraph (b) of this section, Green Meadow
qualifies for the ``55 or over'' exemption, even though it has unoccupied units, provided that at least 80% of its unoccupied
units are reserved for occupancy by at least one person 55 years of age or over.

Example 3: Waterfront Gardens is a 200 unit housing facility to be constructed after March 12, 1989. The owner and manager
of Waterfront Gardens intends to operate the new facility in accordance with the requirements of this section. Waterfront
Gardens need not comply with the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section that at least 80% of the occupied units
be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit until 50 units (25%) are occupied. When the 50th unit
is occupied, then 80% of the 50 occupied units (i.e., 40 units) must be occupied by at least one person who is 55 years
of age or older for Waterfront Gardens to qualify for the ``55 or over'' exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=75 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix A to Subpart E_Guidance on Defining Significant Facilities and Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The guidance set out in this Appendix represents the Department's interpretation of the principles and requirements
of the Fair Housing Act that require, in order for housing to qualify as housing for persons 55 years of age or older,
that there must exist ``significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social
needs of older persons.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends for the Appendix to serve as a resource document for housing providers and others in determining
whether housing qualifies for the ``housing for older persons'' exemption. The Appendix illustrates the application
of the factors that the Department will consider in making its determination. The Department will refer to the interpretive
guidance in the Appendix when considering whether there is reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory practice
has occurred or is about to occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be clearly understood, however, that the examples provided in this Appendix are illustrative and presented
in summary form. The examples are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
intended to predetermine the Department's disposition on any actual case since more detailed facts and circumstances
would have to be considered. Therefore, a claim from a housing provider that the operation of a particular housing
development is an exact replica of one of the examples presented in this Appendix will not preclude the Department
from commencing an investigation under the Fair Housing Act of an alleged discriminatory housing practice directed
against an aggrieved person with familial status; nor will it preclude the Secretary from issuing a determination
based upon the evidence obtained through such an investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department may, from time-to-time, publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->
