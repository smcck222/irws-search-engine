SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to govern the collection of debts owed to the
United States which arose from transactions involving OPM's administrative accounts. These regulations implement
the debt collection procedures provided under the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Act). The Act authorizes the Federal
Government to collect debts by means of administrative offset from other payments due the debtor from the United States,
without the debtor's consent, provided that the debtor is properly notified and given the opportunity to exercise
certain administrative rights. OPM's collection of debts due the Retirement and Insurance Group for payment to the
Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Employees' Life Insurance Fund, the Retired Federal Employees Health
Benefits Fund, or the Employees' Health Benefits Fund is governed by other regulatory provisions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 10 of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Act) (Pub. L. 97&hyph;365) codified at 31 U.S.C. 3701 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
makes several changes in the way Executive and Legislative agencies collect debts owed the Government. The purpose
of the Act is to improve the ability of the Government to collect monies owed it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Act, administrative offset may be initiated when the head of an agency determines that an individual or entity
is indebted to the United States, or is notified by the head of another agency that a person or entity is indebted to the
United States and that the debtor is owed monies by the United States as a result of transactions with a Federal agency.
After the debtor has received certain due process rights, the debt may be collected by administratively offsetting
the debt against the amount due.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Act, before the Government may collect a debt by administrative offset, a debtor must be provided with notice
that a debt is owed, the opportunity to inspect and copy Government records relating to the debt, the option to enter
into a written repayment agreement, and an opportunity for review of the agency's determination concerning the existence
of the amount of the debt, or the repayment terms. The debtor must notify the agency of his or her intent to exercise these
rights within time periods prescribed in these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act permits the agency to initiate an administrative offset prior to the completion of the due process requirements
if failure to do so would substantially jeopardize the agency's ability to collect the debt and if the time remaining
before payment is to be made does not reasonably permit completion of the due process procedures. Such prior offset
must be followed by completion of the due process procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires agencies to issue regulations for administrative offset. This final rule establishes the procedures
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will follow in making an administrative offset from funds paid to a debtor
from OPM's administrative accounts. These regulations apply to the collection of debts owed to the United States
arising from transactions with OPM other than those involving payments made from the Civil Service Retirement and
Disability Fund (the Fund) or where a request for an offset from OPM's administrative accounts_other than the Fund_is
received by OPM from another Federal Agency. Regulations for other agencies to request OPM's Retirement and Insurance
Group to recover a debt from the Fund are provided at subpart R of part 831 and subpart D of part 845 of title 5, Code of Federal
Regulations. These regulations are consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Standards on administrative
offset issued jointly by the Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office as set forth in 4 CFR 102.3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM has determined that this document is interpretative because it implements a definitive statutory scheme and
the requirements contained in regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office.
Accordingly, no Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is required pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). In addition, because this
rule relates to agency management and personnel, no Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is required pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
553(a)(2). For these reasons, a delayed effective date is not required pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(2).

Analysis and Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Interim Rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 19, 1993 (58 FR 60991). The comment period closed on January 18, 1994. Two labor organizations responded
with comments. OPM has fully considered all of their comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 179.303&blank;General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter cited 28 U.S.C. 2415 to question the validity of the time allowed for commencing actions brought by the
United States (6 years rather than 10 years). Section (i) of 28 U.S.C. 2415 states: ``The provisions of this section
shall not prevent the United States or an officer or agency thereof from collecting any claim of the United States by
means of administrative offset, in accordance with section 3716 of title 31.'' That provision precludes agencies
from initiating offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued,
with certain exceptions explained in that section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 179.305&blank;Agency Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter expressed concern that the discretion allowed to suspend transactions in an alleged debtor's account
pending resolution of an appeal (179.305(c)) would have a ``chilling effect on such appeals by depriving appellants
of funds that would otherwise be available to them.'' The intent of the regulations is to suspend transactions in the
account(s) to the extent of the debt owed unless there is evidence of fraud. The language has been modified to clarify
that intent.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter requested that we add to the same section: ``Upon lifting the suspension *&blank;*&blank;* any
payments, removals, or transfers, as well as lost interest or discounts due to the debtor that had been precluded due
to temporary suspension of transactions in any of the debtor's accounts shall be applied retroactively to cover the
period of suspension.'' This authority is not stated in the Debt Collection Act, and without specific authority,
OPM is not authorized to take this action.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter requested an increase in the amount of time allowed for submission of a financial statement from 10 business
days to 30 business days (i.e., from 2 weeks to 6 weeks) ``to allow the debtor sufficient time to accurately prepare
the financial statement.'' OPM feels that 10 business days is adequate for the average debtor to present a statement
of his or her finances. An audited financial statement is not required. Exceptions will have to be considered on a case-by-case
basis.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter wished to add ``with interest'' at the end of the paragraph. The Debt Collection Act of 1982 requires the
assessment of interest, penalty fees, and administrative costs on delinquent debts as a means of strengthening enforcement
of collections; however, it makes no provision to pay interest to the debtor for erroneous collections. OPM is not
authorized to make such payments in the absence of a specific statute or authority permitting such payments.

Regulations for other agencies to request OPM's Retirement and Insurance Group to recover a debt from the Fund are
provided at subpart R of part 831 and subpart D of part 845 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations
are consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Standards on Administrative Offset issued jointly by the Department

(a) The Director or his or her designee, after attempting to collect a debt from a person under section 3(a) of the Federal
Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3711(a)), may collect the debt by administrative offset subject
to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The debt is certain in amount; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It is in the best interest of the United States to collect the debt by administrative offset because it is less costly
and speeds payment of the debt;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Director, or his or her designee, may initiate administrative offset with regard to debts owed by a person to
another agency of the United States Government, upon receipt of a request from the head of another agency, or his or
her designee, and a certification that the debt exists and that the person has been afforded the necessary due process
rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Director, or his or her designee, may request another agency that holds funds payable to an OPM debtor to offset
the debt against the funds held and will provide certification that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The debt exists; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the 6-year period for bringing action on a debt provided in 28 U.S.C. 2415 has expired, then administrative offset
may be used to collect the debt only if the costs of bringing such action are likely to be less than the amount of the debt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) No collection by administrative offset shall be made on any debt that has been outstanding for more than 10 years
unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known, and reasonably could not have been
known, by the official or officials responsible for discovering and collecting such debt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) These regulations do not apply to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A case in which administrative offset of the type of debt involved is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another
statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Debts owed to OPM by other agencies of the United States or by any State or local government.

provide:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A description of the nature and amount of the debt and the intention of OPM to collect the debt through administrative
offset;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of OPM with respect to the debt;

opportunity to negotiate a written agreement for the repayment of the debt. If the financial condition of the debtor
does not support the ability to pay in one lump-sum, reasonable installments may be considered. No installment arrangement
will be considered unless the debtor submits a financial statement, executed under penalty of perjury, reflecting
the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The financial statement must be submitted within 10 business
days of OPM's request for the statement. At OPM's option, a confess-judgment note or bond of indemnity with surety
may be required for the installment agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any reduction or
compromise of a claim will be governed by 4 CFR part 103 and 31 U.S.C. 3711.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to govern the collection of debts owed to OPM's
administrative accounts by Federal employees. These regulations implement the debt collection procedures provided
under the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Act). The Act authorizes the Federal Government to collect debts by means of
offset from the salaries of Federal employees without the employee's consent, provided that the employee is properly
notified and given the opportunity to exercise certain administrative rights. OPM's collection of debts due the
Retirement and Insurance Group for payment to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Employees' Life
Insurance Fund, the Retired Federal Employees Health Benefits Fund, or the Employees' Health Benefits Fund is governed
by other regulatory provisions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5 of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Act) Pub. L. 97&hyph;365) codified at 5 U.S.C. 5514, makes several changes
in the way Executive and Legislative agencies collect debts owed the Government. The purpose of the Act is to improve
the ability of the Government to collect monies owed it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Act, when the head of an agency determines that an employee of any agency is indebted to the United States,
or is notified by the head of another agency that an agency employee is indebted to the United States, the employee's
debt may be offset against his/her pay. Before agencies may use the salary offset recovery procedure, certain due
process rights must be extended to the debtor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the Government may collect a debt by salary offset, an employee-debtor must be provided with notice of the debt
and the opportunity to inspect and copy Government records relating to the debt, enter into a written repayment agreement,
and request an impartial hearing on the determination of the agency concerning the existence or the amount of the debt.
The employee must notify the agency of his/her intent to exercise these rights within the time period prescribed in
the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires agencies to issue regulations for salary offset. This final rule establishes the procedures the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will follow in making a salary offset. OPM has determined that this document
is interpretative; it implements a definitive statutory scheme and the requirements contained in regulations promulgated
by OPM, codified in 5 CFR part 550, subpart K. Accordingly, no Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is required pursuant to
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). In addition, because this rule relates to agency management and personnel, no Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking is required pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2). For these reasons, a delayed effective date is not required
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(2).

Analysis and Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Interim Rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 19, 1993 (58 FR 60993). The comment period closed on January 18, 1994. Two labor organizations responded
with comments. OPM has fully considered all of their comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 179.201&blank;Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commentor requested that we change the 10 years in the second sentence (i.e., the time allowed for commencing actions
brought by the United States) to 6 years. They cited no basis for the request. Section 179.201 is based on 31 U.S.C. 3716
which precludes agencies from initiating offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right
to collect the debt first accrued, with certain exceptions explained in that section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to a commenter, we corrected the reference ``Section 179.207, Notice Requirement'' to ``Section 179.207,
Hearing.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(16) One commenter wished to insert ``with interest'' after the word ``employee'' in this sentence. While the
Debt Collection Act of 1982 requires the assessment of interest, penalty fees, and administrative costs on delinquent
debts as a means of strengthening enforcement of collections, it makes no provision to pay interest to the debtor for
erroneous collections. OPM is not authorized to make such payments in the absence of a specific statute or authority.
This reasoning applies also to the same comment regarding section 179.215 Refunds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Both commenters objected to the perceived inequity in treatment of parties who fail to appear (&sect;179.207(j)).
We have inserted the following language:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

One commenter suggested several other changes to this section, &sect;&sect;179.208 and 179.209 but provided no
bases for the changes. Since the regulation as published complies with requirements of the Debt Collection Act of
1982, the suggested changes were not made.

Purpose.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;365), is to provide a comprehensive statutory approach
to the collection of debts due the Federal Government. These regulations implement section 5 of the Act which authorizes
the collection of debts owed by Federal employees to the Federal Government by means of salary offset, except that
no claim may be collected by such means if outstanding for more than 10 years after the agency's right to collect the
debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect were not known, and could not reasonably
have been known, by the official or officials who were charged with the responsibility for discovery and collection
of such debts. These regulations are consistent with the regulations on salary offset published by the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) on July 3, 1984 (49 FR 27470) in 5 CFR part 550, subpart K.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After the employee requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing to
be provided. If the hearing will be oral, the notice shall set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. If the
hearing will be paper, the employee shall be notified that he or she should submit arguments in writing to the hearing
official by a specified date after which the record shall be closed. This date shall give the employee reasonable time
to submit documentation.

 An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be provided an oral hearing if the hearing official determines that
the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (e.g., when an issue of credibility or veracity
is involved). The hearing is not an adversarial adjudication and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing.
Oral hearings may take the form of, but are not limited to:

 In the absence of good cause shown (e.g., illness), an employee who fails to appear at a hearing shall be deemed, for
the purpose of this subpart, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent. If the
representative of the creditor agency fails to appear, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as scheduled
and make his/her determination based upon the oral testimony presented and the documentary evidence submitted by
both parties. With the agreement of both parties, the hearing official shall schedule a new hearing date. Both parties
shall be given reasonable notice of the time and place of the new hearing.

Voluntary repayment agreement as alternative to salary offset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) In response to a notice of intent, an employee may propose to repay the debt by making voluntary installment
payments as an alternative to salary offset. An employee who wishes to repay a debt without salary offset shall submit
in writing a proposed agreement to repay the debt. The proposal shall admit the existence of the debt, and the agreement
must be in such form that it is legally enforceable. The agreement must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Be in writing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Be signed by both the employee and the creditor agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Specify all the terms of the arrangement for payment; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Contain a provision accelerating the debt in the event of default by the debtor, but such an increase may not result
in a deduction that exceeds 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay unless the employee has agreed in writing to
deduction of a greater amount (5 CFR 550.1104(i)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any proposal under paragraph (a) of this section must be received by the official designated in the notice of intent
within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The creditor agency will review a timely and properly submitted repayment proposal by the employee debtor and
notify the employee whether the proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within the creditor
agency's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by offset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the creditor agency decides that the proposed repayment agreement is unacceptable, the employee will have
15 days from the date he or she received notice of that decision to file a petition for a hearing or a special review as
provided by &sect;179.210. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the creditor agency decides that the proposed repayment agreement is acceptable, the alternative arrangement
must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the creditor agency designee and meet the other requirements of
this section for a voluntary repayment agreement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) An OPM employee subject to salary offset or a voluntary repayment agreement, may, at any time, request a special
review by the Office of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances
such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In determining whether an offset would prevent the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses (food,
housing, clothing, transportation and medical care), the employee shall submit a detailed statement and supporting
documents for the employee, his or her spouse, and dependents indicating: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Income from all sources;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
If an OPM employee requests a special review under this section, the employee shall file an alternative proposed offset
or payment schedule and a statement, with supporting documents (&sect;179.210(b)), stating why the current salary
offset or payments result in an extreme financial hardship to the employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) The Director shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents, and determine whether the original offset
or repayment schedule imposes an extreme financial hardship on the employee. The Director shall notify the employee
in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or repayment schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the special review results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the OPM salary offset coordinator shall
provide a new certification to the payroll office.

Installment deductions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment and, except
in rare circumstances, not to exceed 3 years. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable
relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. The amount deducted for any period will not exceed
15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction
of a greater amount.

Lump-sum deductions from final check.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A lump-sum deduction exceeding the 15 percent disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated voluntarily or involuntarily.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lump-sum deductions from other sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When an employee subject to salary offset is separated from OPM and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset
of the final salary check, the Office, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, the FCCS and OPM's implementing regulations, may
offset the balance of the debt against any financial payment due the employee from the U.S. Government.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple debts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offset, or where two or more debts are owed to a single
creditor agency, OPM payroll office may, at its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously
within the 15 percent limitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Precedence of debts owed to OPM. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For OPM employees, debts owed to the Office generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies. In the event
that a debt to the Office is certified while an employee is subject to a salary offset to repay another agency, the OPM
payroll office may decide whether to have that debt repaid in full before collecting its claim or whether changes should
be made in the salary deduction being sent to the other agency. If debts owed the Office can be collected in one pay period,
the payroll office may suspend the salary offset to the other agency for that pay period in order to liquidate the office
debt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When an employee owes two or more debts, the best interests of the Government shall be the primary consideration
in determining the order of debt collection. The OPM payroll office, in making this determination, will be guided
primarily by the statute of limitations that affects the collection of the debt(s).

 Upon completion of the procedures established in these regulations and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514, the Office must:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Certify, in writing, to the paying agency that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date
on which payment(s) is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, and that the Office's
regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment and
the number and commencing date of the installments (if a date other than the next officially established pay period
is required);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Advise the paying agency of the action(s) taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(b) and give the date(s) and action(s) was
taken (unless the employee has consented to the salary offset in writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt
of the required procedures and the written consent or statement is forwarded to the paying agency);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Submit a debt claim certification containing the information specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i), (a)(3)(ii)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Submit the debt claim, as provided in &sect;179.208, to the employee's paying agency for collection if the employee
is in the process of separating, and has not received a final salary check, or other final payment(s) from the paying
agency. The paying agency must certify the total amount of its collection on the debt and send a copy of the certification
to the employee and another copy to the creditor agency. If the paying agency's collection does not fully satisfy the
debt, and the paying agency is aware that the debtor is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability
Fund or other similar payments that may be due the debtor employee from other Federal Government sources, the paying
agency will provide written notification of the outstanding debt to the agency responsible for making such other
payments to the debtor employee. The written notification shall state that the employee owes a debt (including the
amount) and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. The Office must submit a properly certified
claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before the collection can be made.

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, with modifications, the provisions of an

by broadening the scope of creditable advertising and promotion activities available to handlers and expanding
the Board's ability to engage in a significant generic advertising and promotion program to benefit the entire industry.
This action provides for more effective and efficient use of industry advertising and promotion funds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 981 [7 CFR Part 981], both as amended, hereinafter
referred to as the ``order'' regulating the handling of almonds grown in California. The order is effective under
the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as
the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not
been reviewed by OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary will rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of
the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this final rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 115 handlers of almonds that are subject to regulation under the marketing order and approximately
7,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers have been
defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the almond handlers and producers may
be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action finalizes an interim final rule which revised &sect;981.441 of Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations
and is based on recommendations of the Board, comments received in response to the interim final rule, comments received
in response to the reopening of the comment period of the interim final rule, and other available information. The
interim final rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [58 FR 43500], on August 17, 1993. The rule amended &sect;981.441 of the rules and regulations in effect under the order.
It provided a 30 day comment period which ended September 16, 1993. During this period, one comment was received from
Cal-Almond, Inc., an independent almond handler. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 22, 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California issued a ruling on a district
court order involving an action against the Department by three independent almond handlers wherein such handlers
alleged, among other things, that the Board's advertising program during the 1980's was unconstitutional because
the program violated the handlers' First Amendment Rights. The district court had ruled that the advertising program
was constitutional. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals acknowledged the substantial public interest in designing
effective advertising and promotion programs to stimulate demand and to increase returns to growers but concluded
that the almond program in place during the 1980's was sufficiently flawed in that it did not meet the constitutional
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the potential effect of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal's decision on the newly established Credit-Back
advertising and promotion program and on the almond industry as a whole, the Department determined that it was in the
public interest to reopen the comment period for the interim final rule. Accordingly, the comment period was reopened
on January 31, 1994, [59 FR 4247]. Reopening of the comment period provided interested persons an opportunity to review
the rules for the new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program and to submit additional written opinions and
information regarding the potential effect of the Court's decision on that program. The Department also sought comments
on how to best address the issues raised in the Court's decision. The second comment period closed on March 2, 1994.
Seven additional comments were received. All of the comments received on the interim final rule will be discussed
herein.

Statutory and Regulatory Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Almond Marketing Order is promulgated pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (``Act'').
Congress enacted this statute in 1937, a time of economic upheaval for many farmers, in order to stabilize market conditions
and ameliorate shortages and surpluses. Congress believed that ``establish[ing] and maintain[ing]'' such orderly
marketing conditions would be in the public interest, ultimately benefitting both farmers and consumers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 7 U.S.C. 602 (declarations of policy). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal means by which Congress sought to effectuate these goals is the promulgation of marketing orders under
7 U.S.C. &sect;608c. Marketing orders are regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture, after notice and hearing,
and after a finding by the Secretary that the order's terms ``will tend to effectuate the declared policy of [the Act].''

Pursuant to this statutory scheme, the Secretary has promulgated a marketing order regulating the handlers of almonds
grown in California. The Order is administered by the Almond Board of California (``Board''), which is composed of
industry representatives, whose function it is to administer the Order and to recommend amendments to the Order.
The duties of the Board also include acting as intermediary between the Secretary and industry members; investigating
and collecting data on growing, shipping, and marketing conditions with respect to almonds; furnishing pertinent
information to the Secretary; and keeping record of its acts and transactions. Funds to cover the Board's expenses
are generated by levying assessments on each handler, in proportion to the kernel weight of almonds received.

Background of the California Almond Industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The California Almond Marketing Order has been in effect since 1950. It provides a means for growers and handlers to
work together to address various problems which affect the marketing of California almonds, including varying weather
conditions which can lead to annual swings in production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One way in which the Almond Marketing Order has helped to address problems affecting the industry is by establishing
salable and reserve percentages for all almonds received by handlers during a given crop year. The establishment
of reserve percentages has allowed the Department to regulate the supply of almonds marketed and avoid dramatic price
drops during years of excess production. In years when the anticipated annual crop is large, a reserve percentage
may be established and handlers withhold a percentage of the almonds received from growers from the market. Conversely,
in years when the annual crop proves to be small, reserve almonds are released for sale. In addition, small quantities
of reserve almonds are sometimes used to develop new products or are disposed of in secondary markets such as oil or
livestock feed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has analyzed the production and sale of almonds since the inception of the Almond Marketing Order.
Over the past forty years, the production and sale of almonds, both in this country and abroad, have increased dramatically.
In the 1950's, almond production grew from 19 million to 84 million pounds per year and the value increased from $15
to $38 million. By 1969, production had reached 132 million pounds per year at a value of $74 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 1950's and 1960's, the domestic market was the primary outlet for California almonds. Supplies which exceeded
the needs of the domestic market were exported or put to other ``non-competitive'' uses, such as sliced, diced and
slivered almonds. In 1969, shipments of almonds to export markets exceeded domestic shipments for the first time.
Most export shipments were of reserve almonds which were sold at prices below domestic levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Almond Marketing Order was amended in 1971 to provide for further market development through the establishment
of a creditable advertising and generic promotion program. These programs have been in effect since 1972. In recommending
that the Almond Marketing Order be amended to authorize advertising and promotion programs, proponents within the
almond industry believed that advertising almonds would tend to increase almond consumption and enhance grower
returns. The Department's analysis of sales figures for almonds during the last twenty-two years demonstrate that
this belief was correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adoption of the creditable advertising and generic promotion programs has fostered a period of steady growth
in the demand for almonds, both domestically and abroad. From 1972 to 1992, domestic shipments of almonds increased
from 75 million pounds to 186 million pounds and their value increased from $63 million in 1972 to $318 million in 1992.
During these years, the creditable advertising and generic promotion programs fostered an even greater rate of growth
in the export market. Annual exports of almonds went from 69 million pounds in 1972 to 350 million pounds in 1992 and
the value increased from $58 million to $598 million. The industry has benefitted from increased production and sales
as consumption grew and almonds expanded into new markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the majority of almonds produced in the United States are sold abroad, with the largest markets in Germany
and Japan. The California almond industry has become an established supplier of high quality almonds to markets throughout
the world and has maintained a dominant share (over 60%) of the overall world almond market for the past ten years. Substantial
growth has also occurred in the demand for sliced, diced and slivered almonds, once considered a secondary almond
market. Due to market expansion, shipments of almonds for such uses are now considered normal commercial sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The relative proportion of annual crop sold to ingredient manufacturers in bulk quantities has also increased substantially
during the last two decades. Currently, the majority of almonds sold in the United States are sold for use as ingredients
in candy, cereal, ice cream, baked goods, cookies, granola bars, prepared meals, and other manufactured products.
The Department's data on almond sales to export markets also indicates that the vast majority of almonds sold to European
countries are intended for use as ingredients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the adoption of the creditable advertising and generic promotion programs there has been an increase in the
number of almond handlers operating in the United States. In 1971, there were 15 almond handlers in California and
the four largest handled about 95% of the annual crop. By 1991, there were 115 almond handlers in California and the
four largest handled 62% of the annual crop. The growth of the almond market has enabled small handlers to enter the
industry in greater numbers.

The Former Creditable Advertising Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the time of its adoption in 1971, the almond Marketing Order's advertising and promotion program was structured
with a strong emphasis on individual handler advertising and promotion, with a complementary generic program conducted
by the Board. Since its implementation, the Secretary has instituted numerous rulemaking actions to revise and update
the creditable advertising and promotion program to address changing circumstances in the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In revising the program, the Secretary relied, in part, on industry production and sales data and the Board's consistent
belief that the industry's advertising and promotion program provided an effective means of increasing almond sales.
The Board, on behalf of the industry, responds to changing industry practices and trends by recommending to the Secretary
modifications to the Order's implementing regulations and by redesigning its activities to better reflect these
changes, thereby ensuring further development of the almond industry. In addition, the Secretary also relied on
comments received from almond industry representatives and other interested persons prior to adopting certain
amendments to the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 981.41 of the Order provides the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, authority to credit a handler's
direct expenditures for marketing promotion, including paid advertising, against the applicable portion of their
assessment obligation. The requirements that a handler needed to fulfill before obtaining credit for promotion
are set forth in &sect;981.441 of the Administrative Rules and Regulations. The purpose of these requirements was
to ensure that creditable activities undertaken by handlers were forms of promotion recognized and accepted by advertising
and promotion industry norms, and could reasonably be expected to increase almond consumption. In addition, the
requirements were devised to ensure that creditable activities could be documented and costs could be measured in
conformance with industry standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the time of the program's inception, the list of handler activities for which credit could be obtained has frequently
been revised and expanded in order to meet the changing needs of the industry. In all, over twenty-five Board recommendations
have been made and adopted by the Secretary in an effort to improve the Order's advertising and promotion program.
Some examples of these revisions are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 16, 1982, [47 FR 40783], the creditable advertising and promotion program was revised in order to allow
handlers to receive credit against their creditable assessment obligations for distributing sample packages of
almonds to charitable and educational institutions (up to 150% credit allowed depending on volume), and for purchasing
almond promotional materials from the Board (100% credit allowed). The Board believed that these revisions would
provide handlers with additional opportunities to obtain credit for their promotion of almonds, especially for
handlers who did not market almonds under a specific brand name. These revisions were also intended to be advantageous
to small handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 23, 1987, [52 FR 13427], the program was revised to expand provisions already in place concerning the crediting
of certain handler marketing promotion expenditures related to mail order promotions. Specifically, the costs
of purchasing mailing lists to conduct mail order promotions and the costs of postage and envelopes to mail printed
promotional materials became creditable at a rate of up to $25,000 per crop year. The revision was intended to give
all handlers a new opportunity to take advantage of crediting. In 1990, [55 FR 41826] the creditable amount was further
relaxed to allow handlers to obtain credit for mail order promotions at a rate of up to $25,000 per crop year or 25 percent
of their creditable assessment obligations, whichever was greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 13, 1987, [52 FR 37926], the program was revised to increase the amount of credit that handlers could obtain
for media advertising in certain foreign markets. The revision was made because the export market for California
almonds was steadily increasing and the need for advertising in foreign countries was increasing accordingly. Under
this revised rule, handlers became eligible to receive a 100% credit for all qualified brand advertising media expenditures
conducted in designated foreign markets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 15, 1989, [54 FR 6866], the program was again revised to allow handlers credit against their creditable
assessment obligations for payments for in-store supermarket generic or brand advertising using fixed position
(i.e. stationary) display advertisements, or video media. In addition, the provisions were further expanded to
allow handlers to receive a 150% credit for payments to the Board for the Board's generic advertising and promotion
program. These changes gave handlers additional flexibility in meeting their assessment obligations and particularly
benefited small handlers which did not have brand names and/or did not market their almonds in retail outlets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 16, 1990, [55 FR 41826], the program was further revised to provide handlers with additional opportunities
to receive credit against their creditable assessment obligations for their own branded or generic advertising
and promotional activities by (1) allowing credit for in-store supermarket advertisements using light emitting
diode (LED) signs (a new form of in-store supermarket advertising which was being offered by advertising firms at
that time); (2) expanding the provisions under which handlers could receive credit for in-store supermarket advertisements
using fixed position media; (3) allowing handlers credit for brand advertisements in all foreign countries where
California almonds were sold; and (4) increasing credit for certain mail order promotion costs. These revisions
were intended to better reflect current industry practices as they related to advertising and promotion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the years, other revisions to the program have been adopted in order to expand activities eligible for credit,
improve program administration and generally bring the program into line with industry practices. These numerous
revisions to the program demonstrate the Board's, as well as the industry's, recognition of changing conditions
within the market and their willingness and ability to adapt the almond advertising and promotional program to address
these changes.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reviewed the Almond Marketing Order's former creditable advertising
and promotion program in

 U.S. Department of Agriculture.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The case was brought by three independent almond handlers, each of which challenged the constitutionality of the
Almond Marketing Order's former creditable advertising program on the grounds that the mandatory nature of the program
violated their First Amendment rights. The Department's Judicial Officer upheld the validity of the Order. The handlers
sought review in the United States District Court, which affirmed the Secretary's decision. The handlers then appealed
to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing the District Court's decision, the Court of Appeals held that the former advertising and promotion program
imposed a burden on almond handlers' First Amendment rights, and, therefore, it was necessary to evaluate the nature
and scope of the burden imposed on those rights to determine whether the program was constitutional.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Ninth Circuit evaluated the constitutionality of the former almond advertising and promotion program under
a three-pronged test:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is the governmental interest in establishing and carrying out an advertising and promotion program substantial?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Does the program directly advance that interest?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is the program no more extensive than necessary to achieve the government's purpose?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating the almond program under this test, the Court held that there was in fact a substantial governmental
interest in establishing a program that would stimulate the demand for almonds and help maintain and expand markets
so as to enhance returns to almond growers. The Court went on to find, however, that there was insufficient record evidence
to establish that the former almond advertising and promotion program was effective enough to directly advance the
government's interest in increasing almond sales, and that the rules providing for credit against a handler's assessment
obligation for its own advertising were more extensive and cumbersome than necessary. Thus, it held that the advertising
regulations were an unconstitutional restriction on the handlers' First Amendment rights.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Ninth Circuit did not find inherent constitutional harm in the establishment of research and promotion programs
designed to increase sales and enhance grower returns. In fact, the Court acknowledged the substantial governmental
interest in establishing such programs in order to maintain and expand the markets for agricultural commodities.
The Court's complaint lay with the unique design of the former almond advertising and promotion program, with the
lack of record proof that it directly advanced the stated interests, and with the fact that the former creditable advertising
requirements seemed more extensive than necessary to achieve the approved goals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 17, 1993, [57 FR 43500] represents the most recent and extensive revision to the Order's advertising and
promotion program. Due to changes in the size and structure of the California almond industry during the 1980's and
1990's, as well as the fact that more handlers were beginning to sell almonds for use as ingredients in manufactured
products rather than for direct consumption, there was a general perception within the industry that a new and innovative
program needed to be implemented which would be even more effective than the former program in promoting the sale of
California almonds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This prompted the Board and its Public Relations and Advertising Committee to seek to create a new and widely accepted
advertising and promotion program designed to aid the further development of the almond industry. On April 20, 1993,
by a vote of 9&hyph;1, the Board recommended the new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program. The sole Board
member opposing the new program was generally opposed to the entire concept of creditable advertising and promotion.
This Board member asserted that all handlers should be required to fund a generic promotion program equally and that
any brand advertising done on their own should be carried out at their own expense without any type of Board oversight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program recognizes new marketing techniques which have been developed
by the industry over the years, and is intended to work with and complement a strong generic advertising and promotion
program which will be undertaken by the Board. The premise of the new program is that individual handlers will be most
effective in promoting their own portion of the almond crop while the Board will be the most effective vehicle through
which to enhance total demand for almonds through a generic advertising and promotion program. Some of the significant
features of the new program are as follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the new program, as modified in this final rule, handlers conducting their own advertising and promotional
activities will receive credit against their Credit-Back assessment up to the amount of the Credit-Back assessment
installment due if they conduct and document their advertising and promotional activities at least two weeks prior
to assessment billings. If handlers do not conduct any advertising and promotional activities prior to assessment
billings, they will be required to submit their advertising and promotional assessment when billed. If handlers
conduct advertising and promotional activities after assessment billings and file appropriate documentation,
they will be eligible for a refund or Credit-Back. Handlers will be billed in four equal installments during the crop
year. Handlers are not obligated to take part in the new program. Each handler must make an individual decision whether
or not to participate in the new program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new Credit-Back program substantially expands the list of advertising and promotional activities which will
be eligible for credit under the regulations. The range of activities eligible for credit cover virtually every sales
assistance, promotional, publicity and advertising area which a brand or individual company could use to aid in product
sales, with the exception of price reductions. In all, there are now fourteen advertising, promotion and public relations
categories of activities which will be eligible for credit. These include marketing research, paid media advertising
directed to end-users, trade or industrial users, in-store demonstrations, trade fairs, seminars and exhibits,
couponing, sponsorships, printing costs, trade and consumer product publicity, direct mailings, sales and marketing
presentation kits, and 50/50 advertising with retailers. Each of these activities are widely used and accepted forms
of marketing advertising and promotion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another aspect of the new program is the elimination of the 33% discount which was formerly allowed to handlers who
paid their assessments directly to the Board by a specified date. Under the former creditable advertising and promotion
program, handlers who paid their assessments to the Board by a specific date received a 150% credit against the advertising
and promotional portion of their assessments. These payments were then used by the Board for generic advertising
and promotion. In effect, this allowed handlers a 33% discount on a portion of their assessments. The purpose of the
discount at the time was to encourage smaller handlers which did not have individual advertising and promotional
programs to contribute to the Board's generic advertising and promotion program. Many members of the industry believed,
however, that handlers who received the benefit of the discount did not always pass it on to growers and thus achieved
a competitive advantage over handlers who engaged in individual advertising and promotional programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another feature of the new program is an appeals process whereby handlers have the option of anonymity in the event
a claim for a promotional activity is denied. Handlers may request that the Public Relations and Advertising Committee
review Board staff decisions concerning denied claims. If not satisfied with that committee's decision, handlers
may request that the Board review the issue. Handlers have the option of anonymity when their appeal is brought before
the Board. Finally, handlers may request that the Department review the Board's decisions. The Department may review
all decisions at any point during the appeals process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new Credit-Back program also offers handlers more flexibility in getting credit against their assessments for
their own advertising and promotional activities compared with the former creditable advertising and promotion
program. Some examples of the ways in which the new Credit-Back program offers handlers more flexibility are as follows.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the former program, handlers were denied credit for individual advertisements if those advertisements directed
consumers to a specific retail store. Under the new program, this type of activity will be covered under the 14 broad
categories for which credit will be allowed. Thus, the new program eliminates previous restrictions on handlers
and will allow them greater flexibility in the promotion of their own products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, under the former program credit was denied for advertisements which also promoted competing nuts. Under the
new program, advertisements which contain references to almonds as well as competing nuts will be eligible for reimbursement.
Any reimbursement will, however, be limited to that percentage of the advertisement's cost which is equal to the percentage
of the advertisement which is devoted to almonds or the percentage of the product's weight which is almonds. The Board
believes that the percentage rule is logical and fair because the handler credit originates from assessments on almonds,
not on other products. The Board believes that to allow more credit than provided in the percentage rule would not serve
the best interests of the industry because handlers would receive credit for promoting products which have nothing
to do with the almond industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Previously, handlers were not allowed credit for advertisements which promoted complementary branded products.
Under the new program, credit will be allowed for advertisements that promote both almonds and complementary branded
products. For the reasons described above, however, the amount of the reimbursement will be directly related to the
percentage of the advertisement which is devoted to the promotion of almonds. This will allow the almond industry
to operate under a system which is as unrestricted as possible without sacrificing the objectives of the Almond Marketing
Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, under the old program, credit was denied for advertisements which promoted products which were less than
50% almonds. Under the new program, credit will be granted for all advertisements of products which contain almonds,
regardless of the amount of almonds which are actually in the product. Again, the amount of the reimbursement will
be directly related to the percentage of the advertisement which is devoted to the promotion of almonds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recommending the new Credit-Back program, the Board concluded that because of the fundamental changes which have
occurred in the almond industry in recent years, it has become more difficult for individual handlers to directly
reach end consumers through their own advertising and promotion. Therefore, the importance of a collective industry
effort to generically promote the overall use of almonds has grown. For these reasons, the Board elected to strengthen
its generic promotion program while at the same time providing increased opportunities and incentives for handlers
who wished to continue to advertise their own brand products in order to receive Credit-Back against their assessments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that the implementation of the new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program will directly
advance the industry's collective goal of increasing almond sales and enhancing grower returns. In addition, the
new program encourages and empowers handlers to protect their own interests by promoting their own brand of products
in order to get Credit-Back. The new program also recognizes that the collective interests of the industry are better
served if brand advertising and promotion is combined with the generic advertising and promotion of almonds. Both
generic and brand advertising and promotion are proven promotional tools which have fostered the growth of the almond
market over the last twenty years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new advertising and promotion program has been carefully structured so that the rules which govern its efficient
administration are no more extensive than necessary to meet the desired goals of increasing almond sales and enhancing
grower returns. Virtually all aspects of the former creditable advertising and promotion program have been modified
or eliminated so as to increase efficiency while at the same time imposing a minimum of restrictions on handlers. The
Board, the elective body composed of industry representatives, has carefully considered all aspects of this program
and believes that its implementation will lead to even greater strides in the development of the almond market.

The new advertising and promotion program is intended to enable the almond industry to have an advertising and promotion
program which better reflects its current needs. The Board believes that there is widespread industry support for
the new program. Overall, the new Credit-Back program is expected to foster the worldwide demand for California almonds
through the provision of a more efficient and effective program which will encompass both generic and brand advertising
and promotion.

Discussion of the Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As was previously stated, USDA provided two comment periods for the new Credit-Back program. The first comment period
ended on September 16, 1993. One comment was received during this period from Cal-Almond, Inc., an independent almond
handler. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second comment period ended on March 2, 1994. During this period, seven comments were received. Five comments
were from independent almond handlers. They were Wiggin Farms, Arbuckle, CA; Western Nut Company, Chico, CA; Waterford
Nut Company, Waterford, CA; Rotteveel Orchards, Dixon, CA; and Cal-Almond, Inc., Hughson, CA. A sixth comment was
received from the U.S. Small Business Administration, Washington, DC. The seventh comment was received from Mr.
Rodger Wasson, President and CEO of the Almond Board of California. All of the comments will be discussed below. Because
many of the comments by the independent almond handlers contained similar concerns, they have been combined where
appropriate and are addressed collectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its first comment submitted on September 14, 1993, Cal-Almond, Inc., stated that the issuance of an interim final
rule rather than a proposed rule to establish the new Credit-Back program was arbitrary and capricious. The commenter
asserted that the former creditable advertising and promotion program has been substantially altered by the interim
final rule and the burden on handlers has been drastically increased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Department's position that the issuance of the interim final rule met each of the requirements of the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA) which pertain to the promulgation of regulations. The Board requested that the new regulations
for the Credit-Back program be effective for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year. The only way to accomplish this was through
the utilization of interim final rulemaking procedures, as authorized by the APA. Also, the Department was advised
by the Board that the action was widely supported by the industry. While there was one dissenting vote among the ten
Board members who voted on the establishment of the new program, that person was opposed to the imposition of any advertising
assessments on members of the industry. The dissenting Board member had no specific criticisms of the new Credit-Back
program. Finally, contrary to the commenter's assertion, the interim final rule represented a relaxation of the
then-existing regulations. Moreover, the new Credit-Back program, as modified in this final rule, is further relaxed.
The new program is carefully structured so that the rules which govern its efficient administration are no more extensive
than necessary to meet the desired industry goals of increasing almond sales and enhancing grower returns. The new
program substantially increases the advertising and promotional activities for which handlers can receive credit
against their assessment obligations. At the same time, it decreases the number of reporting deadlines and recordkeeping
requirements imposed on handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond further asserted that the Department does not have the authority to regulate how handlers pay growers
and that the new Credit-Back program's elimination of the provision which allowed handlers to receive a 150% credit
against the promotional advertising portion of their assessments because of concerns about grower returns was therefore
arbitrary and capricious. The commenter contended that: (1) the Almond Marketing Order does not permit the Department
to insure that growers receive a certain amount of returns on their products, and (2) the Order does not permit the Department
to become involved in contracts which handlers have with their growers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the commenter's assertions, the interim final rule establishing the new Credit-Back program does not
specify how handlers should pay almond growers, nor does it seek to regulate the returns which growers receive for
their almonds. It is, however, the Act's intent that marketing orders help growers and handlers to work together to
solve problems which affect their industry. Thus, industry practices which have a potentially negative effect on
growers should be considered when making recommendations on changes to marketing order regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond and another independent almond handler, Western Nut Company, also commented that the new Credit-Back
program requires handlers to make expenditures of $3 in order to get back $1, thus placing an incredible financial
burden on handlers. Cal-Almond stated that this, in turn, will reduce handlers' initial payments to growers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, independent almond handler, John Rotteveel on behalf of Rotteveel Orchards, indicated that he did not
believe that the 50% return for creditable activities was enough to warrant any investment in the program. Grant Ecker
on behalf of Waterford Nut Company, stated the new Credit-Back program places a larger economic burden on small handlers
than the old program did.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cal-Almond also objected to the new Credit-Back program's imposition of a 50 percent Credit-Back limit for promotional
activities in foreign markets. Cal-Almond stated that this is not an expansion of the previous rule, but is instead
a restriction because the former rule allowed 100% credit for qualified promotional activities in foreign markets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The former creditable advertising and promotion program allowed for variable levels of credit for different activities,
between 50 percent and 150 percent depending on the activity. The new Credit-Back program is designed to be more equitable
because the credit allowed for all activities is the same. The amount of credit granted for foreign advertising expenditures
is identical to the amount given for domestic advertising. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that having the same credit amount for each activity provides equity for all handlers' advertising
and promotional activities. No preference is given in the new Credit-Back program for one type of advertising and
promotional activity over another. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The range of Credit-Back activities has been expanded so that handlers will be able to receive credit for 13 additional
categories of promotion and advertising. This expansion could offset any increased outlays which handlers must
make for brand promotion and advertising projects due to the reduced rate of credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new Credit-Back program is designed to provide handlers with more flexibility in conducting their advertising
and promotional activities. The commenters seem to be suggesting that it would be more desirable for the new program
to have an increased credit amount than what is currently allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 16, 1994, the Board met and discussed possible revisions that could be made to the new Credit-Back program. It
was expressed at this meeting that the 50 percent Credit-Back amount may impose a greater financial burden on handlers
than was anticipated. The Board unanimously recommended that the Credit-Back amount be modified from 50 percent
to 662/3 percent ($1.00 for every $1.50 spent). It was determined that this amount would provide incentive for handlers
to maintain their individual advertising and promotional efforts and still allow adequate funds for the generic
portion of the new advertising and promotion program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the new Credit-Back program's expanded activities along with an increased credit amount
will provide handlers with more incentive to maintain and more flexibility to conduct their individual advertising
and promotional efforts. Therefore, we are modifying the new Credit-Back program in this final rule by increasing
the amount of credit allowed for approved promotional activities from 50 percent to 662/3 percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cal-Almond also claimed that the requirement that handlers file an application with the Board to obtain pre-approval
of creditable activities means that handlers cannot change their advertising plan for the entire year. Cal-Almond
also objected to the requirement that handlers submit proof of at least one approved advertising activity by January
15 of each year. Sharon Wiggin, on behalf of Wiggin Farms, also stated that the form filing requirements and deadlines
contained in the interim final rule are difficult to meet. The Department has determined that these comments have
merit. The purpose of the requirement that handlers file an application with the Board to obtain pre-approval of creditable
activities under the new program was to ensure that handlers were aware that the activity was eligible for Credit-Back
prior to expending funds for the activity. In the past, the Board occasionally had to reject claims for activities
that did not qualify after the promotional activity had already been conducted by the handler. The pre-approval provision
was only intended to assist handlers by helping them avoid any unnecessary outlays of funds for activities that did
not qualify for credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This aspect of the new program was also discussed at the recent Board meeting. The Board unanimously recommended that
the pre-approval provision was not essential to the successful administration of the program. As previously explained,
this provision was only intended to assist handlers. Handlers will no longer be required to obtain pre-approval of
creditable activities from the Board under the new program as modified in this final rule. The Board will continue
to assist any handler in determining whether an advertising and promotional activity is eligible for Credit-Back
under the new program prior to the handler expending funds for the activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond also objected to the provision which allows Credit-Back payments only for the portion of product weight
represented by almonds or the handler's actual payment, whichever is less. The commenter claims that this provision
works against those handlers who apply for Credit-Back for advertising of processed products that contain only a
small percentage of almonds. The new Credit-Back program is, however, intended to allow Credit-Back only for money
actually spent for advertising California almonds, not for advertising another product. As discussed previously,
the Board believes that the percentage rule is logical and fair because the handler's credit originates from assessments
on almonds, not on other products. Without the percentage rule, the best interests of the entire industry would not
be served because handlers would receive credit for promoting products which have nothing to do with the almond industry.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond also objected to the provision which requires a handler's name, brand, or the words ``California almonds,''
to appear on the product's primary face label in order for the handler to be eligible for Credit-Back. The commenter
contended that, because nearly all almonds produced in the United States are grown in California, the requirement
that the word ``California'' be placed on the label is unnecessary and may limit marketing opportunities for some
handlers in their negotiations with product manufacturers. The intent, however, of the new advertising and promotion
program is to promote the sale and consumption of ``California'' almonds, not other ingredients in products or almonds
not grown in California. This provision will help ensure that advertising generated by the new Credit-Back program
is, indeed, for almonds grown in California. In addition, the provision is not limited to the word ``California''
being placed on the product's primary face label in order for the handler to be eligible for Credit-Back. Handlers
can also negotiate with product manufacturers for the appearance of the handler's name or brand on the primary face
label in order to be eligible for Credit-Back. Handlers have three alternatives under the new program, all of which
ensure the promotion of ``California'' almonds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond, Thomas L. Motta, on behalf of Western Nut Company, Grant Ecker, and Sharon Wiggin objected to handlers
being required to expend advertising and promotion funds up-front in order to be eligible for a Credit-Back refund
at a later date. Cal-Almond also stated that handlers should not have to wait until February 15 of the crop year to begin
receiving Credit-Back refunds and that they should not have to wait 30 days after submission of claims to receive a
refund. The Department has determined that these comments have merit. Because payment practices have been changed
under the new Credit-Back program, the up-front payment may not provide some handlers with enough flexibility early
in the crop year to conduct their advertising and promotional activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This aspect of the new program was also discussed at the recent Board meeting. The Board unanimously recommended that
handlers conducting their own advertising and promotional activities may now receive credit against their Credit-Back
assessment up to the amount of the Credit-Back assessment installment due if they conduct and document their advertising
and promotional activities at least two weeks prior to assessment billings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined that in order to allow handlers more flexibility early in the crop year to conduct their
advertising and promotional activities, this final rule will be modified to allow handlers to receive credit against
their Credit-Back assessment up to the amount of the Credit-Back assessment installment due if they conduct and document
their advertising and promotional activities at least two weeks prior to assessment billings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cal-Almond also objected to the appeal process for determining whether a handler should receive Credit-Back for
a particular promotional activity. The commenter claimed that competitors of some handlers will determine the outcome
of their appeals. As previously discussed, handlers have the option of anonymity when their appeal is brought before
the Board. In addition, the process allows for further appeal to the Department. The Department also has the right
to review all decisions at any point during the appeal process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the second comment period, Cal-Almond, as well as another independent almond handler, Rotteveel Orchards,
commented that under the new Credit-Back program there are many types of promotional and advertising activities
which handlers use to promote their products which will be ineligible for Credit-Back. John Rotteveel, on behalf
of Rotteveel Orchards, stated the best forms of advertising for his company_``word-of-mouth'' advertising and
personal contact with potential buyers_are not creditable activities under the new Credit-Back program. In addition,
Rotteveel indicated that he did not believe that the 50% return for creditable activities was enough to warrant any
investment in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As has already been pointed out, the range of promotional activities eligible for reimbursement under the new Credit-Back
program have been significantly expanded. The Department has also modified the new Credit-Back program in this final
rule by increasing the amount of credit allowed for approved promotional activities from 50 percent to 662/3 percent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond also objected to the Board's television advertisements because it believes that they have a religious
connotation which should not be used to promote almonds. The advertising campaign referred to is not intended to be
offensive toward any religion, nor does it contain any negative connotations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond also objected to the portion of the provision which requires individual handlers to determine and declare,
within 15 days after the start of the season, the extent to which they intend to use the advertising program. According
to the commenter, a handler should not be required to report a year in advance how he/she intends to advertise over an
entire year's period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of this provision, in part, was to help the Board plan its finances for the upcoming crop year. With this information
available, the Board could determine who was participating and who was not participating in the new program for that
year. They would know at that time that all handlers who did not declare their intent would be paying the entire assessment
to the Board and that amount could be earmarked for the generic advertising and promotion program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision did not require handlers to give a dollar amount or an advertising plan to the Board, but merely an anticipated
percentage of their entire advertising assessment they believed would be used under the new program. The deadline
was not intended to limit a handler's use of the program. Handlers were not restricted to any types of advertising or
any specific amounts. However, the total Credit-Back amount could not exceed the original percentage reported to
the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Cal-Almond's interpretation of this provision is not accurate, the Department considered all aspects
of this provision to determine if there were other ways that the Board could obtain this information without requiring
handlers to declare their intent to utilize the program. The new Credit-Back program is intended to provide handlers
with more flexibility to conduct their own advertising and promotional activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the Board has other alternatives to accomplish the objectives discussed above, such
as reviewing handler participation during past years to obtain an estimate of participation in the new Credit-Back
program for the new crop year. The Department has determined that in order to allow handlers more flexibility to participate
in the new Credit-Back program, this provision should be eliminated from the regulations. Accordingly, this final
rule will be revised to reflect that change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the second comment period, another independent handler, Wiggin Farms, stated that a referendum should be
conducted every three years to offer growers an opportunity to vote on increasing or decreasing advertising expenditures
and for voting on continuation of the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that the Board currently has the authority to recommend annual changes in program expenditures.
Determining the merits of holding periodic continuance referenda is outside the scope of this rulemaking. The referenda
issue was addressed last year when the Board and other industry groups recommended, during a formal rulemaking hearing
in Modesto, California, that periodic referenda be held. The Department is in the process of reviewing and evaluating
the record of the formal rulemaking proceeding.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many comments, as requested, addressed the Ninth Circuit decision. These comments are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cal-Almond stated that all of the rules and regulations contained in the interim final rule deprive handlers of their
First Amendment rights and suggested that the entire creditable program be eliminated. The commenter asserted that
a determination has never been made by the Board as to whether the Order or individual handlers are better at promoting
and advertising almonds. The commenter further stated that there have never been any studies conducted to indicate
whether the current advertising program is effective and contended that the Department is unable to show that the
regulations are required in order to advance the stated goal of selling more almonds and increasing returns to producers.
In addition, the commenter contended that the regulations contained in the interim final rule are more extensive
than necessary to serve the governmental interest of increasing almond sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One independent almond handler, Thomas Motta on behalf of Western Nut, stated that if the Marketing Order's advertising
program is deemed constitutional at some future date, the Secretary should evaluate what type of advertising program
best serves the almond industry. Motta further stated that the Ninth Circuit ruled that compelled advertising violates
a handler's First Amendment rights and that regardless of what the Board calls it, it is still forced collection. Motta
suggested that the advertising provisions of the order be put on hold until they are proven to be beneficial to the industry
and are determined to be legal by the appropriate Court. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another independent almond handler, Grant Ecker on behalf of Waterford Nut Company, stated that he agrees with the
Ninth Circuit Court ruling that the regulations hinder handler's efforts to increase sales and returns to growers.
He stated that the new Credit-Back program places a larger economic burden on small handlers than the old program did.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
John Rotteveel, on behalf of Rotteveel Orchards, stated that the current and former advertising programs violate
his constitutional rights. He believes that the program is a waste of money and does nothing to increase the consumption
of almonds that almond handlers could not do themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Rotteveel stated that there is no way to prove that the advertising programs have increased world demand
for almonds. He believes that growers and handlers are expanding these markets without the help of the Order and does
not think that the increase in the number of handlers and growers in the United States can be attributed to the Order.
Rotteveel suggested phasing out the Order and letting the almond industry run itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Department's position that the former creditable advertising program and the new Credit-Back program meet
each of the criteria set forth in the Ninth Circuit decision which pertain to constitutionality. The Department believes
that both programs are authorized under the Act and that the regulations do not infringe upon the First Amendment rights
of any handler. Importantly, the Court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cal-Almond 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
did not hold that all advertising and promotion programs are unconstitutional or illegal on their face. Rather, the
court recognized the substantial government interest in promoting almond consumption in order to stimulate the
demand for almonds and enhance grower returns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously discussed, the new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program has been carefully structured so
that the rules which govern its efficient administration are no more extensive than necessary to meet the desired
goals of increasing almond sales and enhancing grower returns. Virtually all aspects of the former creditable advertising
and promotion program have been modified or eliminated so as to increase efficiency while at the same time imposing
a minimum of restrictions on handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional comment in the form of an exception to another comment was received from Cal-Almond well after the second
comment period closed. Because Cal-Almond's comment was received after the close of the comment period, it has not
been considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment was received from the Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the United States Small Business Administration
(SBA). The SBA contended that the Secretary did not comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) in issuing the
interim final rule. It recommended that the Department perform a regulatory flexibility analysis, which would study
the impact of advertising programs on small handlers and would consider alternatives to the program. The SBA further
stated that the Secretary's assertion about small entity orientation and compatibility did not meet the requirements
of the RFA. The SBA stated that the RFA does not provide exceptions for statutes that are not compatible with its goals.
The SBA commented further that: (1) most small handlers sell to ``food processors'' and have no reason to promote fresh
consumption of almonds, and (2) advertising expenses designed to increase use by ingredient manufacturers were
not creditable under the old program and are not creditable under the new program. Finally, the SBA stated that the
Credit-Back program was promulgated with no evidence that it would advance the government's interest, or that it
is the least restrictive program needed to enhance almond sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the SBA indicated that the Secretary should consider alternatives to the current advertising
program, including no program at all, or, at a minimum, a program that imposes less restrictions on handlers. The SBA
also recommended that promotional efforts targeting ingredient manufacturers should be given the same credit as
those targeting fresh consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advertisements resulting from joint participation by a handler and manufacturers or sellers of two complementary
products or commodities were eligible for credit under the former advertising and promotion program provided that
the brand name was used.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the new Credit-Back program, advertising and promotion activities to trade, industrial or end users are specifically
eligible for Credit-Back, with no requirement for a brand name. In addition, the Board's generic program contains
consumer advertising designed to communicate the message that almonds enhance any product to which they are added.
Research has found such consumer advertising is successful in promoting consumption of products used as ingredients.
Increased consumption of almonds benefits the entire industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department disagrees with the SBA's assertion that this action fails to meet the requirements for the Regulatory
Flexibility Act. The SBA's concerns regarding the program's impact on small businesses have been properly addressed
in this document and the interim final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a comment was received from Rodger Wasson, CEO of the Almond Board, which supported the new Credit-Back program
and supplied documentation to substantiate the Board's position. Mr. Wasson discussed the history of the almond
industry and beneficial changes that have taken place since the implementation of the creditable advertising program.
He stated that the program has provided a variety of services designed to increase the demand for California almonds.
In addition, it has continually been revised to meet the needs of the industry. Mr. Wasson stated that the Credit-Back
provisions were recommended in order to more fully address the needs of the changing industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
He stated there are major differences between the previous creditable advertising program and the new Credit-Back
program. Some examples are as follows: (1) The previous program allowed handler credit for paid media 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advertisements only. There were separate systems for ``generic packs'' and ``150 percent credit''. The new Credit-Back
program adds 13 advertising, promotion and public relations categories (only travel is excluded across-the-board);
(2) The previous program contained many reporting periods, carryovers, and recordkeeping on different systems.
Credit-Back is simplified with one system, no carryovers, and a basic report-as-you-go reporting system; (3) The
previous program did not allow credit for almonds used as an ingredient if the product contained less than 50 percent
of almonds by weight. Credit-Back allows credit for the weight represented by almonds as an ingredient; (4) The previous
program did not allow credit for advertisements directing consumers to one or more named retail outlets, other than
handler-operated outlets. Credit-Back allows such advertisements if they include mention of almonds; (5) The previous
program did not allow credit for advertisements promoting ``competing nuts.'' Credit-Back allows credit for this
activity determined by the portion of the product represented by almonds and/or product weight, and (6) The previous
program did not allow credit for advertisements that promote more than two complementary products. Credit-Back
allows credit up to the portion represented by almonds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Mr. Wasson submitted materials on the benefits of generic advertising. A summary of the materials is
as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Generic Advertising and Promotion Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generic advertising, i.e., advertising activities which focus on the general properties of a product such as flavor,
nutritional benefits and convenience, rather than touting specific brand names, is a proven promotional tool which
is often used to increase demand for agricultural commodities. When used in conjunction with brand name promotion,
generic advertising has proven to be highly successful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, generic advertising of agricultural commodities has grown steadily since the first commodity
board was created more than 50 years ago. In 1990, about 350 generic promotion programs were in effect at the federal
and state levels, covering more than 80 commodities at a cost of over $530 million annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the federal programs referred to above are overseen by USDA. The Agricultural Marketing Service (``AMS'')
of the USDA currently oversees promotional programs contained in various federal marketing orders authorized under
the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (the AMAA). These marketing orders cover fruits, vegetables, specialty
crops and milk. In addition, AMS has oversight responsibility for numerous federal statutes which authorize research
and promotion programs for a variety of commodities, including beef, cotton, dairy, eggs, honey, limes, mushrooms,
pork, potatoes, soybeans, milk, and watermelons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The success of many of these advertising and promotion programs has been well documented. For instance, an advertising
campaign conducted by the Potato Board has yielded dramatic results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Potato Board was founded in 1972 at a time when potato consumption was steadily declining. Many people had poor
images of potatoes, did not know of their nutritional value and believed that they were fattening. In the years after
its formation, the Board initiated numerous advertising campaigns designed to improve the potato's poor reputation
and increase consumer sales. As a result, potato consumption has increased by 12% and 96% of the public is now aware
that potatoes are a high fiber, low fat food which can be included in any healthy diet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efforts of the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board to promote milk and milk products have also met with success.
The Board was founded in 1984 and since then has spent more than $75 million annually on the promotion of dairy products.
As a result, dairy product consumption rose by 12% between 1983 and 1990.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another example of a successful generic program is provided by the California Prune Board. In the 1980's, prunes were
not a popular fruit and most members of the public had little knowledge of their nutritional value, specifically,
their high fiber content. In 1987, the prune Board began a campaign to highlight the link between consumption of high
fiber foods (such as prunes, which were marketed as a good tasting, high fiber fruit) and cancer prevention. The program
included direct mailings of product samples to physicians, publicity and media appearances by experts about the
health benefits of prunes, and sampling programs in shopping malls and on domestic airline flights. Combined with
generic advertising and promotion, the program resulted in a 12% increase in prune sales in 1987 alone. To date, the
sales of California prunes continue to rise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The success of certain commodity programs has also been measured through technical economic studies on the effects
of generic advertising on industry sales. The results are impressive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For instance, in a recent study of the Washington apple industry (Olan D. Forker and Ronald W. Ward, 1991) it was estimated
that between 1988 and 1991, the industry received a rate of return of $6.63 for every dollar of assessments spent on
the promotion of apples. In all, this represented a $133.76 million dollar return on a $17.5 million investment and
the market price which Washington apple growers received for their apples between 1988 and 1991 was estimated to be
12.9% higher than it would have been without generic advertising. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, a recent study sponsored by the Cattlemen's Beef Promotion and Research Board (Ronald W. Ward, 1993) examined
the effects of generic advertising on the beef industry. Based on extensive economic analysis, it was estimated that
between 1987 and 1992, the beef industry realized an average return rate of $5.80 for every dollar spent on promotional
activities. By February 1992, the total economic return to the industry was estimated at $2.99 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A study by Ronald Ward and Bruce Dixon in 1989 provides an economic analysis of the effects of generic advertising on
fluid milk consumption. The authors of this study found that such promotion, authorized under the National Dairy
and Tobacco Adjustment Act of 1983, ``confirm[s] a statistically significant relationship between fluid milk consumption
and generic fluid milk advertising *&blank;*&blank;*'' Other research conducted by O.D. Forker and H.M. Kaiser
of Cornell University indicates that between 1984 and 1990, dairy farmers realized a farm level return rate of 4.6
to 1 on investments in generic advertising authorized under the National Dairy Promotion Program.

Mr. Wasson also submitted materials on the benefits of branded advertising. A summary of the materials is as follows.

Branded Advertising
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The usefulness of branded advertising to increase the sales of a particular product is also well documented. Within
the private sector, companies unfailingly recognize the importance of advertising and collectively spend billions
of dollars a year on advertising and promotion activities in order to generate sales. In 1992 alone, the nation's top
20 advertisers spent more than $500 million on advertising. (Advertising Age, August 29, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the agricultural field, brand advertising is also a useful tool which has been found to benefit not only the
actual brand advertiser, but the overall industry as well. Through brand advertising, handlers seek to move their
own products from the shelf to the consumer. A recent study conducted by an economist at the University of California
at Davis, Department of Agricultural Economics (Jason Christian, 1994) concluded that brand advertising has afforded
substantial benefits to all California almond growers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In his analysis, Christian examined the market effects of brand advertising by one large almond cooperative as well
as other independent handlers, between 1972 and 1992. Based on Christian's analysis, it was estimated that the average
rate of return to the industry as a result of brand advertising by the cooperative was substantial. During the 1980's
the average rate of return for each additional dollar spent on advertising expenditures was about $5.00. Aside from
the individual brand advertiser, other handlers in the industry also benefited from the advertising because it created
an increased demand for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 almonds. Between 1979 and 1990, the benefits received by other almond handlers actually exceeded the returns received
by the brand advertiser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Wasson also submitted materials on the effects of almond promotion on the industry, including documentation
on imports and exports of almonds and statistical tables on the almond industry. A summary of the materials is as follows.

Effects of Almond Promotion on the Almond Industry
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Aside from the studies described above, there are numerous other indications that the combined creditable and generic
advertising program administered by the Almond Board has been highly successful. Statistics indicate that both
the supply and demand of California almonds have increased significantly since the inception of the Almond Marketing
Order's advertising and promotion program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the early 1980's the U.S. almond crop averaged about 300 million pounds. By the early 1990's the almond crop averaged
about 550 million pounds. Almonds have thus attained a level of market growth which few other agricultural commodities
can claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significantly, grower prices for almonds have remained relatively stable throughout these years of increased production.
One basic theory of economic analysis is that prices for a product will fall if supply increases without a corresponding
increase in demand. The relative stability of prices within the almond industry throughout the years of increased
production indicate that demand for California almonds has increased dramatically over the years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another measure of the growing popularity of almonds can be obtained through analysis of per capita consumption.
USDA figures indicate that the United States' per capita consumption of almonds is well ahead of that of any competing
nuts. In 1970&hyph;71, the average American's per capita consumption of almonds was about .34 pounds per person.
In 1987&hyph;88, the average per capita consumption of almonds was .58 pounds per person. By 1991&hyph;92, per capita
consumption had risen to .82 pounds per person. This represents a 40% increase in per capita consumption between 1987
and 1992. Importantly, no tree nut was promoted more aggressively than almonds during this period. Additionally,
the tree nut with the second largest per capita consumption between 1987 and 1992 was walnuts, at just .54 pounds per
person.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further evidence of the growth of the almond industry is provided by the fact that the use of almonds as ingredients
in new products continues to increase. In 1992, almonds were most often included in all new foods containing tree nuts
or peanuts which were introduced on the market. In all, 35% of all new products containing any type of nuts which were
introduced in 1992 contained almonds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department notes that economic studies of the almond industry also show that advertising is a good use of industry
funds. In his 1985 study of the relationship between advertising, risk and domestic sales of almonds, Dr. John Baritelle,
a research agricultural economist and a professor at the University of California-Riverside, concluded that advertising
has been a good investment for the industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the basis for his study, Baritelle posed the initial question, ``What does the industry get for its advertising
dollar, and what would we get if we advertised even more?'' (Non-Technical Statement on Almond Advertising Model
and Domestic Sales, at p. 2) (July, 1985). Almond crops for the years 1981 through 1983 were analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study found that for the crop year 1981, when almond production was at an all time high of 408 million pounds and the
advertising budget was 10.86 million dollars, total estimated returns on advertising ranged from $1.21 to $4.51
for each dollar spent. This figure included the estimated returns that advertising dollars expended in 1981 would
yield in 1982 since the study found that advertising has an impact on per capita sales in the year of expenditure as well
as in the following year. Importantly, Baritelle found that even if the 1981 advertising budget had been increased
by 25% to $13.58 million, the industry would still have received a total return of at least $1.02 on every dollar spent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1982, when almond production returned to more normal levels and the advertising budget was $8.85 million, total
estimated returns on advertising ranged from $1.75 to $6.26 for each dollar spent. Again, this figure included the
estimated returns that advertising dollars expended in 1982 would yield in 1983. Additionally, Baritelle noted
that even if the 1982 budget had been increased by 75% to $15.49 million, the return to the industry would have been at
least $1.04 for every dollar spent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Department notes that in 1983, when almond production was low due to poor weather conditions and the advertising
budget was $6.10 million, estimated returns ranged from $2.34 to $8.37. Again, this figure took into account returns
that were expected to be realized in 1984.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Wasson went on to state that although investing in the advertisement of almonds is a proven way to increase sales,
it is significant that, when compared to other commodity boards, the Almond industry spends relatively little on
promotional activities. For instance, the Washington Apple and Almond industries have similar crop sizes_about
$1 billion_yet the Almond Board spends substantially less on advertising than the Washington Apple Commission.
The Almond Board's promotional budget for the year 1993&hyph;94 was $5.4 million. The Washington Apple Commissions'
advertising expenses for that same period was a little over $7.0 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also significant that the Almond Board's lengthy process of developing and implementing generic advertising
campaigns is consistent with advertising industry norms. Testing and monitoring is performed at various stages
in the development and airing of advertisements and follow-up research on their effectiveness is conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Different concepts regarding the best method of promoting almonds are also explored. For example, focus group concept
testing was conducted prior to the 1993&hyph;94 advertising campaign, and a concept was chosen from four alternatives.
Advertisements were then developed, presented to a consumer audience for reaction, and adjustments and refinements
were made before a final product was developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After airing an advertisement, consumer awareness is measured since this is a basic measurement of an advertisement's
effectiveness. Results of these tests recently showed that the television advertisement approved for use by the
Almond Board during the 1993&hyph;94 campaign was very successful. In addition, based on the experience gained from
the 1993&hyph;94 campaign, the Board has conducted research to assist in developing a new program for 1994&hyph;95.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order and its regulations were initiated by the industry for the benefit of the industry. Without majority industry
support, the Order, or any part of it, could have been suspended or terminated. Mr. Wasson concluded by stating that
the advertising and promotional programs instituted by the Board have received continual majority support since
their inception.

The Department's Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's experience has been that whenever a segment of any industry is ``required'' to do certain things
in order to make a program work for all, it is not unusual to find members of the industry who do not agree with any or all
aspects of the program. There are some who just do not want to participate in any advertising or promotion programs.
In order for a marketing order to be successful, however, participation by everyone is very important.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the decision of the Ninth Circuit, the Department's oversight responsibilities of the almond marketing order
were carefully analyzed and considered. It was determined that it is in the best interest of the majority of the almond
industry that the advertising and promotion program continue as modified herein.

(a) In order for a handler to receive credit for his/her own promotional activities from his/her pro rata portion of
advertising assessment payments, pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;981.41(c), the Board must determine that such expenditures meet the applicable requirements of this section.
Credit will be granted either in the form of a payment from the Board, or as an offset to the advertising assessment if
activities are conducted and documented to the satisfaction of the Board at least two weeks prior to assessment billings.
Credit, hereinafter termed ``Credit-Back'', will be granted in an amount not to exceed 662/3 percent of a handler's
proven expenditures for qualified activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The portion of the handler assessment for which credit may be received under this section will be billed, and is
due and payable, at the same time as the portion of the handler assessment used for the Board's administrative expenses,
unless the handler(s) conduct and document activities at least two weeks prior to assessment billings. In the latter
case, handlers' advertising assessment obligations will be reduced according to the amount of proven activities
approved by the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Board shall grant Credit-Back for qualifying activities only to the handler who performed such activities
and who filed a claim for Credit-Back in accordance with this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Credit-Back shall be granted only for qualified promotional activities which are conducted and completed during
the crop year for which Credit-Back is requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The following requirements shall apply to Credit-Back for all promotional activities: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Credit-Back granted by the Board shall be that which is appropriate when compared to accepted professional practices
and rates for the type of activity conducted. In the case of claims for Credit-Back activities not covered by specific
and established criteria, the Board shall grant the claim if it is consistent with practices and rates for similar
activities. To this end, the Board may issue guidelines for qualifying activities from time to time as warranted.
For activities in markets other than the United States and Canada, paragraph (e)(5) of this section shall also apply.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The clear and evident purpose of each activity shall be to promote the sale, consumption or use of California almonds,
and nothing therein shall detract from this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No Credit-Back will be given for advertising placed in publications that target the farming or grower trade. No
Credit-Back shall be given for any outdoor advertising or sponsorships in the California almond growing counties
of Butte, Colusa, Fresno, Glenn, Kern, Madera, Merced, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare counties,
except that, outdoor advertising in these counties which specifically directs consumers to a handler-operated
outlet offering direct purchase of almonds will be eligible for Credit-Back. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Credit-Back shall be granted for those qualified activities specified below, except that Credit-Back for travel
expenses will not be allowed in any case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Credit-Back for promotional activities in a foreign market shall be granted at 662/3 percent of a handler's unreimbursed
expenditures for qualified activities in any foreign market, if the handler is promoting pursuant to a contract with
the Foreign Agricultural Service, USDA (FAS) and/or the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). Such
activities must also meet the requirements of paragraphs (e) (1), (2), (3), (4), and (6) of this section. Unless the
Board is administering the foreign marketing program, such activities shall not be eligible for Credit-Back unless
the handler certifies that he/she was not and will not be reimbursed by either FAS or the CDFA for the amount claimed
for Credit-Back, and has on record with the Board all claims for reimbursement made to FAS and/or the CDFA. Foreign
market expenses paid by third parties as part of a handler's contract with FAS or CDFA will not be eligible for Credit-Back.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A handler must file claims with the Board to obtain Credit-Back for promotional expenditures, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) All claims submitted to the Board for any qualified activity must include:

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Beech Model 400A and 400T (military
T&hyph;1A) airplanes, that requires an inspection of certain flap roller retention components to detect discrepant
or missing parts, and replacement of discrepant or missing parts; and installation of new washers on the roller attach
bolts. This amendment is prompted by reports of undersized tabs on some lock washers, and tabs or inner tangs missing
from the washers installed on the flap roller bolts. Such discrepancies defeat the locking function of the tab washer,
and could result in loss of the nut and flap roller. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of the
main or aft flap surface and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Beech Model 400A and 400T (military T&hyph;1A) airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 15, 1994 (59 FR 11939). That action proposed to require an inspection of certain flap roller retention components
to detect discrepant or missing parts, and replacement of discrepant or missing parts with new or serviceable parts;
and installation of new washers, tab washers, and flat washers on the roller attach bolts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 122 Model Beech 400A and 400T (military T&hyph;1A) airplanes of the affected design in the
worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 102 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take
approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55
per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $100 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $55,080, or $540 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Lockheed Model 382 series airplanes,
that requires a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual to require takeoff operation in accordance with revised performance
data. This amendment is prompted by a report of a change that had been incorporated into the propeller governor of these
airplanes during production, which altered the thrust decay characteristic of the propeller when operating in an
engine failure scenario. The actions specified by this AD are intended to ensure that the airplane is operated at sufficient
speeds to mitigate the problems associated with a faster thrust decay and to prevent the airplane from departing the
side of the runway.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Lockheed Model 382 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 25, 1994 (59 FR 14124). That action proposed to require a revision to the FAA-approved AFM to require takeoff
operation of the airplane in accordance with the revised performance data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter supports the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 112 Model 382, 382E, and 382G series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet.
The FAA estimates that 18 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1 work
hour per airplane to accomplish the AFM change, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $990, or $55 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series
airplanes, that requires removal of the actuator from the fuel-ballast transfer valve, and installation of a locking
device on the fuel-ballast transfer valve. This amendment is prompted by a report that the fuel-ballast transfer
valve on certain airplanes must be modified to ensure the valve is closed at all times. If the transfer valve is open
during flight, the fuel supply to the engines may be reduced during cross-feed operation to the extent that fuel starvation
could occur. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent engine flameout due to fuel starvation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14799). That action proposed to require removal of the actuator from the fuel-ballast transfer
valve, and installation of a locking device on the fuel-ballast transfer valve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter supports the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 5 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 0.5
work hour per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will cost approximately $250 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $1,387.50, or $277.50 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D
series engines. This action requires initial and repetitive inspections of the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly,
replacement of the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly with a more leak-resistant configuration, and replacement
of aluminum oil pressure and scavenge tube fittings with steel fittings. This amendment is prompted by reports of
two engine fires initiated by fuel leakage from the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly, ignition of that fuel,
melting of aluminum oil pressure and scavenge tube fittings that are in the proximity of the Number 7 nozzle, and augmentation
of that fire with the liberated oil. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent fuel leakage from the Number
7 fuel nozzle and support assembly, ignition of that leaking fuel, and liberation of oil from melted oil line fittings,
which can result in an uncontained engine fire and damage to the aircraft.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received two reports of uncontained engine fires on Pratt &amp; Whitney
(PW) JT8D series engines due to fuel leakage from the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly, ignition of that fuel,
melting of aluminum oil pressure and scavenge tube fittings that are in the proximity of the Number 7 nozzle, and augmentation
of that fire with the liberated oil. The resulting fire burned through the engine diffuser case and fan ducts, causing
an aircraft engine cowl fire. The FAA has determined that the fuel nozzle and support assembly is susceptible to incomplete
or improper refurbishment or repair that could result in fuel leaks across the fuel nozzle seals, and that the aluminum
oil pressure and scavenge tube fittings have inadequate fire resistance capability. These oil line fittings are
in the path of the fuel leaking and associated fire from the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly. Impingement
of the fire on these oil fittings causes them to melt, thus causing the oil contained in the oil tubes to escape and to
augment the fire. Therefore, this amendment will require the inspection of the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly
for evidence of fuel leakage and burning until replacement of the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly with a more
leak-resistant configuration. It also requires replacement of the aluminum oil tube fittings with steel fittings.
This condition, if not corrected, could result in fuel leakage from the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly,
ignition of that leaking fuel, and liberation of oil from melted oil line fittings, which can result in an uncontained
engine fire and damage to the aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. A6153, Revision 1,
dated June 8, 1994, that describes procedures for initial and repetitive borescope inspections of the Number 7 fuel
nozzle and support assembly; and ASB No. A6169, Revision 1, dated June 15, 1994, and A6170, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 13, 1994, that describe procedures for replacement of the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly with a more
leak-resistant configuration and replacement of the aluminum oil tube fittings with steel fittings, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other PW JT8D series engines of the
same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent uncontained engine fire and damage to the aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD requires inspection of the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly for evidence of fuel leakage and burning
until replacement of the Number 7 fuel nozzle and support assembly with an improved sealing configuration. This AD
also requires replacement of the aluminum oil tube fittings with steel fittings. The actions are required to be accomplished
in accordance with the alert service bulletins described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Boeing Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes, that requires a revision to the Flap Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unit input wiring. This amendment is prompted by reports of disconnection of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Landing Gear Module electrical connectors, which can result in the loss of the primary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary, and alternate control of the flaps. The actions specified by this AD are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to prevent the possibility of an all-flaps-up landing due to the loss of control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all flap operations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain Boeing Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes was published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Federal Register on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24671). That action proposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a revision to the Flap Control Unit (FCU) input wiring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, Boeing, requests that the discussion of the addressed unsafe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition that appeared in the preamble to the notice be clarified. In that preamble, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA stated that, if the landing gear module connectors become disconnected, all FCU 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modes of flap operation (primary, secondary, and alternate control of flaps) could be lost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter suggests that the discussion would have been more precise if it had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained information to indicate that the landing gear module includes the ALTN ARM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FLAPS switch and the ALTN FLAPS position selector used to control the leading and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trailing edge flaps in the alternate mode. The FAA acknowledges this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter requests that the proposal be revised to cite the latest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision of Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;27A2346 as the source for modification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. The FAA concurs. Since issuance of the notice, the FAA has reviewed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved Revision 1 of Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;27A2346, dated May 19, 1994. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision contains a correction to a type of wire that had been called out in the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
version of the service bulletin; this correction ensures that the wire and its associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solder sleeve are metalurgically compatible. In order to ensure that the correct wiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification assembly is installed on the affected airplanes, the FAA has determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the revised service bulletin should be cited as the appropriate source of service information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for complying with the requirements of this rule. The final rule has been revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly. The FAA has confirmed that no U.S. operators have yet modified any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected airplane in accordance with the original service bulletin; therefore, by citing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised service bulletin, the final rule will impose no additional economic burden on any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the compliance time be extended from the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 days to 90 days, due to a possible parts availability problem. This commenter states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it does not normally stock the required parts and materials to accomplish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed requirements of the rule. This commenter has ordered these parts from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplier and is currently waiting to obtain them. Additionally, this commenter points out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the manufacturer's service bulletin, referenced in the proposal, recommends 60 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for modification. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. In developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an appropriate compliance time for this action, the FAA considered not only the degree of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urgency associated with addressing the subject unsafe condition, but the manufacturer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation as to an appropriate compliance time, the availability of required parts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the practical aspect of installing the required modification within a maximum interval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time allowable for all affected airplanes to continue to operate without compromising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety. The FAA points out that the parts required for the wiring modification are readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available; therefore, obtaining them within the proposed compliance time should not pose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a problem for any affected operator. Further, the FAA took into account the 60-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance time recommended by the manufacturer, as well as the number of days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for the rulemaking process; in consideration of these factors, the FAA finds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 days after the effective date of this final rule will fall approximately at the same time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance as recommended by the manufacturer. However, under the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) of the final rule, the FAA may approve requests for adjustments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance time if data are submitted to substantiate that such an adjustment would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an acceptable level of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 300 Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes of the affected design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 34 airplanes of U.S. registry will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Required parts will cost approximately $200 per airplane. Based on these figures, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $25,500, or $750 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100
series airplanes. This action requires repetitive inspections of the hydraulic selector valve to determine the
rate of leakage of hydraulic fluid, and replacement of certain valves with serviceable valves, if necessary. This
AD also provides an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This amendment is prompted by a report
of pilot valve leakage of hydraulic fluid in a landing gear selector valve on a Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplane. The
actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent inadvertent retraction of the landing gear in the event of a low
voltage condition at the selector valve down solenoid.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe
condition may exist on certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series airplanes. Transport Canada advises
that it has received a report of pilot valve leakage of hydraulic fluid in a landing gear selector valve on a Model DHC&hyph;7
series airplane. The cause of this leakage has been attributed to a faulty seal. Such leakage, if combined with a low
voltage condition at the selector valve down solenoid, could result in inadvertent retraction of the landing gear.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the same selector valve that is used on Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes is installed on Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100
series airplanes, the FAA finds that the latter airplane model also is subject to the addressed unsafe condition.
The FAA may consider issuance of parallel rulemaking action to address this unsafe condition on Model DHC&hyph;7
series airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
De Havilland, Inc., has issued Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A8&hyph;32&hyph;117, dated December 11, 1992, that describes
procedures for repetitive inspections of the hydraulic selector valve to determine the rate of leakage of hydraulic
fluid, and replacement of certain valves with serviceable valves, if necessary. Transport Canada Aviation classified
this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;94&hyph;05, dated March
16, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
De Havilland, Inc., also has developed a valve (Modification 8/0530) that incorporates several improvements to
minimize pilot valve leakage. This valve is equipped with an improved spring that keeps the valve firmly seated. The
improved valve incorporates a reduced rate of opening and further restricts the orifice leading to the landing gear
actuators. Replacement of certain valves with these improved valves will minimize the possibility of inadvertent
landing gear retraction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available
information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for
operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent inadvertent retraction of the landing gear
in the event of a low voltage condition at the selector valve down solenoid. This AD requires repetitive inspections
of the hydraulic selector valve to determine the rate of leakage of hydraulic fluid, and replacement of certain valves
with serviceable valves, if necessary. This AD also provides an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections.
The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;76&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes. This action requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repetitive inspections of the hydraulic selector valve to determine the rate of leakage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydraulic fluid, and replacement of certain valves with serviceable valves, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD also provides an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment is prompted by a report of pilot valve leakage of hydraulic fluid in a landing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gear selector valve on a Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplane. The actions specified in this AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are intended to prevent inadvertent retraction of the landing gear in the event of a low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voltage condition at the selector valve down solenoid.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Transport Canada Aviation, which is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may exist on certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes. Transport Canada 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation advises that it has received a report of pilot valve leakage of hydraulic fluid in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landing gear selector valve on a Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplane. The cause of this leakage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been attributed to a faulty seal. Such leakage, if combined with a low voltage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition at the selector valve down solenoid, could result in inadvertent retraction of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landing gear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
De Havilland, Inc., has issued Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A7&hyph;32&hyph;97, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 10, 1992, that describes procedures for repetitive inspections of the hydraulic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selector valve to determine the rate of leakage of hydraulic fluid, and replacement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain valves with serviceable valves, if necessary. Transport Canada Aviation classified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;94&hyph;04, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dated March 16, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
De Havilland, Inc., also has developed a valve (Modification 7/2516) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporates several improvements to minimize pilot valve leakage. This valve is equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with an improved spring that keeps the valve firmly seated. The improved valve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporates a reduced rate of opening and further restricts the orifice leading to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landing gear actuators. Replacement of certain valves with these improved valves will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize the possibility of inadvertent landing gear retraction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued to prevent inadvertent retraction of the landing gear in the event of a low voltage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition at the selector valve down solenoid. This AD requires repetitive inspections of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hydraulic selector valve to determine the rate of leakage of hydraulic fluid, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement of certain valves with serviceable valves, if necessary. This AD also provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The actions are required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA is considering the issuance of parallel rulemaking action to address the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same unsafe condition on Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series airplanes.

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.

Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;75&hyph;AD.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16
series airplanes, that requires inspection to detect chafing of the wiring harness of the air driven generator (ADG),
modification of the wiring harness, and repair of any chafed harness. This amendment is prompted by a report that the
wiring harness on certain airplanes was produced in a configuration that is subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chafing and electrical shorting. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chafing or shorting of the wiring harness, which could result in loss of ADG power to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential bus when the ADG is deployed during an emergency situation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Canadair Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 14, 1994 (59 FR 11735). That action proposed to require inspection to detect chafing and modification of the
wiring harness of the air driven generator (ADG), and repair of any chafed harness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 25 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1 work
hour per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,375, or $55 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that it will take approximately 9 work hours per airplane to accomplish the modification and the
average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $199 per airplane. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of the modification on U.S. operators is estimated to be $17,350, or $694 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the figures, above, the total (inspection plus modification) cost impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $18,725, or $749 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes, that
requires modification of the mounting structure of the elevator controls on the rear pressure bulkhead. This amendment
is prompted by the results of a structural analysis which indicate that certain structure in the elevator control
system may be subject to deformation when maximum load is exerted by the pilot(s) in the event of a jam in the elevator
control cables. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent reduced controllability of the airplane
due to structural deformation in the elevator control system.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to all Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 15, 1994 (59 FR 11947). That action proposed to require modification of the mounting structure of the elevator
control components on the rear pressure bulkhead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined
that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 8 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 16.5
work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will be provided at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $7,260, or $907.50 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA Form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260&hyph;3, 8260&hyph;4, and 8260&hyph;5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents in unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedures before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and &sect;97.20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of the Federal Aviations Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The large number of SIAPS, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard
for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs by FDC/P NOTAMs,
the TERPS criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports. All SIAP amendments
in this rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as
an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPS. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of two supplemental
new animal drug applications (NADA's) filed by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co. One supplemental NADA provides for
use of fenbendazole granules, the other provides for use of a fenbendazole Type A medicated article to make Type C medicated
feed, both products for use as dewormers for zoo and wildlife animals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., Rt. 202&hyph;206, P.O. Box 2500, Somerville, NJ 08876&hyph;1258, filed a supplement
to NADA 121&hyph;473 that provides for use of fenbendazole 22.2 percent granules to top dress feed, and a supplement
to NADA 131&hyph;675 that provides for use of a fenbendazole Type A medicated article (4 percent, 8 percent, and 20
percent) to make Type C medicated feed. The supplements provide for using 2.5 to 10 milligrams of fenbendazole per
kilogram of body weight per day for 3 days for removal and control of internal parasites in zoo and wildlife animals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Supplemental NADA 121&hyph;473 is approved as of May 31, 1994, supplemental NADA 131&hyph;675 is approved as of July
11, 1994, and the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 520.905b and 558.258 to reflect the approvals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of NADA 131&hyph;675 is for use of fenbendazole Type A medicated article to make Type C medicated feed. Fenbendazole
is a Category II drug which, as provided in 21 CFR 558.4, requires an approved form FDA 1900 for making a Type C medicated
feed. Therefore, use of fenbendazole Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds as in NADA 131&hyph;675
requires an approved form FDA 1900. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and &sect;514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of these applications may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration,
rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), these
supplemental approvals qualify for a 3-year period of marketing exclusivity, for supplemental NADA 121&hyph;473
for this use beginning May 31, 1994, and for supplemental NADA 131&hyph;675 for this use beginning July 11, 1994, because
new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) conducted by the sponsor were
required for the approvals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the establishment of tea standards for the year beginning May
1, 1994, and ending April 30, 1995. The tea standards are provided for under the Tea Importation Act (the Act). The Act
prohibits the importation of a tea that is inferior to the annual tea standard. Under the Act, the importation of a tea
may be withheld until FDA examines the tea and is sure that it complies with the annual standard.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the unique nature of the decisionmaking process for establishing annual standards for tea, the procedural
protections that are part of this process, and the short period within which standards must be set, FDA has never, since
the enactment in 1897 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 41), used notice and comment rulemaking for tea standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each final rule setting the standards is based on the recommendations of the Board of Tea Experts (the board), which
is comprised of tea experts who are representative of the tea trade. The board selects standards each year according
to the provisions of the Act. The board bases its selection on tea samples submitted by members of the tea trade to the
board. Relying primarily on organoleptic examination, the board selects one tea to represent the standard for each
major type of tea imported into the United States. In choosing a standard, the board tries to select one at least equal
in quality to that of the previous year. The Act prohibits the importation of a tea that is inferior to the annual tea
standard. Under the Act, the importation of a tea may be withheld until FDA examines the tea and is sure that it complies
with the annual standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual meeting of the board is open to the public and is announced in advance in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. At the annual meeting any interested person may present data, information, or views orally or in writing regarding
new standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual tea standards are prepared and submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services by the board (21 CFR
1220.41).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should a tea importer be dissatisfied with an FDA tea examiner's rejection of a shipment of tea, the importer can refer
its complaint to the U.S. Board of Tea Appeals and then to the U.S. Court of Appeals. FDA is unaware of any complaints
or arguments having ever occurred concerning a designated standard, despite the many years since the enactment of
the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA concludes that notice and comment rulemaking to set tea standards is impracticable, contrary to the public interest,
and unnecessary by virtue of the factors discussed above, i.e., the unique, longstanding procedures that apply to
establishing a standard, the fact that standards are based principally on organoleptic examinations by tea experts,
the public participation opportunities already provided, and the timeframes required for issuing annual standards.
Hence, the agency is not following notice and comment rulemaking procedures in establishing the final tea standards
for 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(b)(1) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant impact on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

Analysis of Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified
in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive
Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of this rule on small entities, including small businesses, was reviewed in accordance with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) (5 U.S.C. 601). FDA has concluded that this action will not result in a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, FDA certifies, in accordance with section
605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, that no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
will derive from this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before August 10, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this regulation. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Any changes in this regulation
justified by such comments will be the subject of a further amendment.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule further implements section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended,
42 U.S.C. 1439(d), so as to maximize flexibility in the provision of the Headquarters Reserve authorized under section
213(d)(4) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 213(d)(4) permits the Secretary of HUD to retain not more than five percent of the financial assistance that
becomes available under all programs authorized under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (except for public housing
operating subsidy under section 9 and modernization funding under section 14). However, the current regulation
implementing the Headquarters Reserve at &sect;791.407 is more delimited. It only permits a Headquarters Reserve
of five percent of the total amount of budget authority which is ``fair shared'' pursuant to Part 791, Subpart D. The
effect of the regulatory limitation is to narrow considerably the base upon which the five percent reserve is calculated,
as compared to what the statute permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this interim rule, the base would be expanded by including not only the amount of funding which is fair shared
pursuant to the formula at &sect;791.403(b)(2), but also all budget authority allocated for uses that the Secretary
determines are incapable of geographic formula, as spelled out at &sect;791.403(b)(1). Examples of the latter category
include amendments of existing contracts, renewals of assistance contracts, the section 8 loan management and property
disposition accounts, assistance earmarked by the Congress in appropriation law line items, and uses of budget authority
identified in the Department's Operating Plan submitted to the Appropriations Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the amount of funding available under the Headquarters Reserve will be increased by this interim rule, the
limited statutory purposes for which funding is permissible are maintained. Reserve funding can only be used for
unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural and other disasters; housing needs resulting from emergencies,
as certified by the Secretary, other than such disasters; housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation;
and housing in support of desegregation efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tragedies of recent disasters are a highly visible predicate for this interim rule. The confluence in 1993 of Hurricane
Andrew, Hurricane Iniki, and Typhoon Omar and this year the Northridge earthquake in California have placed substantial
pressure on the Department to provide prompt, efficient assisted housing relief for disaster victims.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, the Department finds itself involved in longstanding litigation for which equitable resolution frequently
requires the delivery of housing assistance in order to achieve fair, reasonable settlement. Expanding the ranging
of the Headquarters Reserve will facilitate handling these unpredictable pressures for disaster relief and litigation
settlements, as well as for emergencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Precisely because the incidence of these types of housing assistance funding are unpredictable, the availability
of readier resources through an increased Reserve is one which HUD will only call upon as needed. That is, although
a greater amount of budget authority will be made available under this interim rule than is the case under the current
regulation, this does not mean that HUD will use the full statutory maximum in this year or any year. The draw upon the
Reserve will be carefully tempered to exigencies and real, immediate need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD notes that the basis upon which the five percent can be calculated does not include the section 202 program of supportive
housing for the elderly. Section 801(b) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) removed
the section 202 program from coverage under section 213(d). However, NAHA did not repeal a previous amendment to section
213(d)(1)(A)(i) made by section 101 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989. This amendment
requires that section 202 assistance be allocated in a manner that ensures that awards of that assistance are made
for projects of sufficient size to accommodate facilities with supportive services appropriate to the needs of frail
elderly residents. Moreover, the Department has elected to continue the fair sharing of section 202 housing assistance
in order to promote fair and balanced geographic diversity. (The fair sharing formula for section 202 assistance
is specifically tailored at &sect;791.402(c)(1) to reflect relevant characteristics of the elderly population.)
Notwithstanding this retention of section 202 allocations in part 791, the statutory range for calculation of the
five percent Headquarters Reserve is now effectively limited to programs under the United States Housing Act of 1937
which are covered by section 213(d). Therefore, the revision to &sect;791.407 under this interim rule limits_for
calculation purposes_the Reserve to five percent under those 1937 Act programs.

The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed and approved this
interim rule, and in so doing certifies that this interim rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The interim rule revises existing procedures for the allocation of housing assistance
funds and for local government and HUD review of applications for housing assistance, but will make no change in the
economic impact of these procedures on small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this interim rule relate only to internal administrative
procedures whose content does not constitute a development decision nor affect the physical condition of project
areas or building sites, and therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this interim rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, this interim rule will not substantially
alter the established roles of HUD and the States and local governments, including PHAs, in administering the affected
programs. As a result, the interim rule is not subject to review under the Order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
interim rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being
and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will
result from promulgation of this interim rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.

G. Justification for Interim Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR Part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from the general rule
where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this interim rule for effect without first soliciting public
comment, in that prior public comment is contrary to the public interest because immediate effectiveness of this
interim rule will permit the Department to respond immediately to housing assistance needs brought on by natural
and other disasters, housing needs resulting from emergencies arising from unpredictable and sudden circumstances
causing housing deprivation or causing an unforeseen and significant increase in lower income housing demands in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving, with an additional requirement, a proposed amendment to the Utah permanent regulatory program
(hereinafter referred to as the ``Utah program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA).
Utah proposes revisions to its rules pertaining to the scope of rulemaking and promulgation of rules, petitions to
initiate rulemaking, hearing requirements for designating areas unsuitable for coal mining, confidentiality
of coal exploration information, permit application requirements pertaining to blasting and hydrology, and mining
in special areas, specifically prime farmland and alluvial valley floors. The amendment incorporates the additional
flexibility afforded by the revised Federal regulations, clarifies ambiguities, and improves operational efficiency.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated August 2, 1993 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;851), Utah submitted to OSM a proposed amendment
to its program pursuant to SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1201&hyph;1328, and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Chapter VII (the
Federal regulations). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. Utah proposed revisions to the
Utah Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Board of Oil, Gas and Mining (Board) at Utah Administrative Rules (Utah
Admin. R.) 641&hyph;112&hyph;100, scope of rulemaking, and 641&hyph;112&hyph;200, promulgation of rules. Utah
also proposed revisions to the Utah Coal Mining Rules at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500, petitions to initiate
rulemaking; 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, hearing requirement for designating areas unsuitable for coal mining and
reclamation operations; 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, confidentiality of coal exploration information; 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661,
permit application blasting level chart; 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760, permit application cross sections and maps
showing hydrologic information; and 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110 and 645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310, special areas
of mining, specifically prime farmland and alluvial valley floors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah proposed to delete the scope of rulemaking provision at Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112&hyph;100 that requires
the Board to promulgate such procedural and substantive rules it deems useful or necessary to implement statutory
duties, fulfill its statutory obligations, or interpret the statutory authority under which it operates. At Utah
Admin. R. 641&hyph;112&hyph;200, Utah proposed to revise the procedures for promulgation of rules to provide that
the Board will promulgate rules under the authority provided at Utah Code Annotated (UCA) Sections 40&hyph;6&hyph;5,
40&hyph;9&hyph;3.5(2), and 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1). At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500, Utah proposed that
persons other than the Division of Oil, Gas and Mining (Division) or the Board may petition to initiate rulemaking
pursuant to Utah Admin. R. 641 and the Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, UCA 63&hyph;46&hyph;8. At Utah Admin.
R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, Utah proposed that within 10 months after receipt of a complete petition to designate
an area unsuitable for coal mining, the Board shall hold a public hearing in the locality of the area covered by the petition
``unless the petitioners and intervenors agree.'' At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, Utah proposed to revise
its coal exploration confidentiality provision to require that the Division will not make information available
for public inspection, if the person submitting it requests in writing, at the time of submission, that it not be disclosed
and the information is classified as being protected, private, or controlled under the Utah Government Records Access
and Management Act (GRAMA) or confidential under other applicable State or Federal laws, rules, or regulations.
At Utah Admin. R 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661, Utah proposed to delete the reference to UCA 63&hyph;46a&hyph;3(7)(a)
and reference only Figure 1 in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.67, which shows the maximum allowable ground particle
velocity for blasting operations. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760, Utah proposed to add to its hydrology
permit application requirements that the Division may, depending on the structures and facilities located in the
permit area, require other relevant cross sections and maps, in addition to those cross sections and maps already
specifically required by the State's existing rules. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Utah proposed
to revise its prime farmland permit application content requirements to indicate that U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Soils Handbooks 436 (Soil Taxonomy) and 18 (Soil Survey Manual) are incorporated on the effective date, rather
than the date of adoption, of Utah Admin. R. 645. Also, at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Utah proposed
to delete the statement that notices of changes made to the USDA handbooks will be periodically published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310, Utah proposed to revise its alluvial valley floor water quality requirement
by adding language that incorporates by reference the specific publication by Maas and Hoffman, ``Crop Salt Tolerance_Current
Assessment,'' Table 1, ``Salt Tolerance of Agricultural Crops.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the August 27, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(58 FR 45305, administrative record No. UT&hyph;865), and in the same document, opened the public comment period
and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the substantive adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public
comment period closed on September 27, 1993. The public hearing, scheduled for September 21, 1993, was not held because
no one requested an opportunity to testify.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns for (1) Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, regarding the incorrect
reference to its rulemaking authority at UCA 40&hyph;9&hyph;3.5(2), which was repealed by Utah in 1993; (2) Utah
Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, regarding the need for agreement between the petitioners and intervenors to change
the location of a public hearing on a petition to designate lands unsuitable for mining; (3) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200,
regarding the proposed deletion of the phrase ``and the information is confidential,'' which would impart a change
in the criteria for determining coal exploration information that is or is not allowed to be held confidential under
the Utah program, and the proposed reference to Utah's GRAMA in that certain aspects of GRAMA were previously found
to be less effective than the Federal regulations with regard to the restrictions Utah's GRAMA imposes on the availability
of coal exploration information; and (4) Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, regarding the need to use the
prime farmland soil survey standards in USDA Handbook 436, as it existed on October 5, 1982, and USDA Handbook 18, as
it existed on November 16, 1982. OSM notified Utah of these concerns by letter dated December 9, 1993 (administrative
record No. UT&hyph;878).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated January 7, 1994, Utah responded to OSM's concerns by submitting revisions to its proposed program
amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;881). Utah proposed the following revisions to its existing rules.
At Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, Utah proposed to reference UCA 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), which applies to rulemaking
authority under the Utah Mined Land Reclamation Act. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, Utah proposed that
(1) unless the petitioners and intervenors agree otherwise, the Board shall hold a public hearing within 10 months
after receipt of a complete petition to designate lands unsuitable for mining; (2) if all petitioners and intervenors
agree that a public hearing is not needed, the hearing need not be held; and (3) all hearings held under Utah Admin. R.
645&hyph;103&hyph;441 will be held in the locality of the area covered by the petition. At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200,
Utah proposed to require that the Division will not make coal information available for public inspection if the person
submitting it requests in writing, at the time of submission, that it not be disclosed and the information is confidential
under the standards of the Federal Act (SMCRA). At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Utah proposed to require
that USDA Soils Handbooks 436 and 18 are incorporated by reference as they respectively existed on October 5, 1982,
and November 16, 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17,
finds, with an additional requirement, that the proposed program amendment as submitted by Utah on August 2, 1993,
and as revised on January 7, 1994, is no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed revisions to the following previously-approved rules that are nonsubstantive in nature and consist

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441 (30 CFR 764.17), hearing requirements for designating areas unsuitable for
coal mining and reclamation operations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760 (30 CFR 779.24, 779.25, and 780.14 for surface mining, and 783.24, 783.25,
and 784.23 for underground mining), permit application cross sections and maps showing hydrologic information,
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310 (30 CFR 785.19), special areas of mining, specifically alluvial valley
floors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the proposed revisions to these previously-approved Utah rules are nonsubstantive in nature, the Director
finds that these proposed Utah rules are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director approves these
proposed rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Substantive Revisions to Utah's Rules That Are Substantively Identical to the Corresponding Provisions of the
Federal Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a parenthetical note, existing Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661 (1) incorporates by reference Figure
1 in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.67, which shows the maximum allowable ground vibration for blasting operations,
(2) cites its administrative procedures statute at UCA 63&hyph;46a&hyph;3(7)(a) as the authority for incorporating
this figure into its rules, and (3) indicates that the figure can be viewed in the Division's office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah proposed to delete the reference to its statutory authority for incorporating the figure from the Federal regulations
into its rules. This deletion does not render Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661 less effective than the Federal
regulations at 30 CFR 816.67(d)(4)(i). In fact, the proposed State rule includes requirements that are substantively
identical to the requirements of the Federal regulation. Therefore, the Director approves the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, Scope of Rulemaking and Promulgation of Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed to delete Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112&hyph;100, relating to scope of rulemaking. The effect of this
proposed deletion on the Utah program is nonsubstantive because (1) this rule only generally described Utah's authority
to promulgate rules for its statutes and (2) the concepts contained in this rule are repeated with more specificity
at Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112&hyph;200, which Utah proposed to recodify as Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed to revise recodified Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112, to indicate that the Board will promulgate rules
under the authority of UCA 40&hyph;6&hyph;5, 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), and 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
UCA 40&hyph;6&hyph;5, a provision of the Utah Oil and Gas Conservation Act, provides the statutory authority for
jurisdiction of the Board over oil, gas, and mining operations. UCA 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), a provision of the Utah
Mined Land Reclamation Act, provides that, in addition to the powers, functions, and duties provided to the Board
in UCA 40&hyph;6, the Board has the power, function, and duty ``to enact rules according to the procedures and requirements
of Title 63, Chapter 46a, that are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.'' UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1),
a provision of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act, provides that, in addition to the powers, functions, and duties
of the Board and Division provided in UCA 40&hyph;8, the Board and Division have the power, function and duty ``to make
and promulgate in accordance with Title 63, Chapter 46a, the Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, such rules as are
specifically necessary for the regulation of coal mining operations and reclamation operations.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed references in Utah Admin. R. 641&hyph;112 to UCA 40&hyph;6&hyph;5, 40&hyph;8&hyph;6(1), and 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1),
which give the Board the necessary powers to enact rules regulating oil, gas and mining operations, are consistent
with the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 732.15(b), which requires a State regulatory authority to possess the authority,
under State law, to implement, administer, and enforce all of the applicable requirements of Subchapter K of the Federal
regulations. Therefore, the Director approves the proposed rule.

4. Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500, Petition to Initiate Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500 to provide that ``persons other than the Division or
Board'' may petition to initiate rulemaking pursuant to the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Board at Utah Admin.
R. 641 and the Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act at UCA 63&hyph;46&hyph;8.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utah's definition of ``person'' at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;3(14) is substantively identical to the definition of ``person''
at section 701(19) of SMCRA. Also, Utah's definition of ``person'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200 is substantively
identical to the definition of ``person'' in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 700.5. Both definitions include units
and instrumentalities ``of Federal, State, or local government,'' such as the Board and the Division.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 700.12 provide that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 person may petition the Director to initiate a proceeding for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of any regulation
under SMCRA. Utah's proposed revision would appear to prohibit the Division or Board from petitioning to initiate
rulemaking. There is no similar prohibition provided in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 700.12, which allow any
person, including groups, organizations, and other entities, regardless of affiliation, to petition to initiate
rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1) (Powers, Functions, and Duties of the Board and Division), the Board and Division
have the authority to make and promulgate rules for the regulation of coal mining operations and reclamation operations.
Therefore, it is not necessary for either the Board or the Division to have the right to petition to initiate rulemaking.
Under UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;6(1), the Board and Division, as the governmental entities entrusted with the regulation
of surface coal mining in Utah, are the initiators of rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM specifically interprets the proposed amendment, however, to allow an individual member of the Board or employee
of the Division, in his or her capacity as an individual, to petition the Board to initiate rulemaking. Section 102(i)
of SMCRA provides that one of its purposes is the protection of the right of the public to participate in the rulemaking
process. Utah may not deny any member of the Board or any employee of the Division the right to petition the Board for
rulemaking, as such a denial would render the State program inconsistent with section 102(i) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On this basis, the Director (1) finds that Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;500 is no less effective than the Federal
regulations at 30 CFR 700.12 and (2) approves the proposed rule.

5. Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, Permit Application Contents for Prime Farmland
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110 to provide that, with respect to prime farmland
soil survey standards, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbooks 436 and 18 are incorporated by reference as they
respectively existed on October 5, 1982, and November 16, 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 785.17(c)(1)(i) provides that U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbooks 436 and
18 are incorporated by reference as they existed on October 5, 1982, and November 16, 1982. Therefore, the USDA handbooks
incorporated by reference into Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110, and handbooks incorporated by reference
into the Federal regulation, are the same. On the basis, the Director (1) finds that Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110
is no less effective than the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 785.17(c) (1)(i) and (2) approves the proposed rule.

6. Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, Confidentiality of Coal Exploration Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Utah proposed to revise Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200 to provide that the information submitted as part of
a coal exploration permit is confidential (1) if the person submitting it requests in writing at the time of submission
that it not be disclosed and (2) the information is confidential under the standards of the ``Federal Act.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200, Utah defines the ``Federal Act'' to mean SMCRA. The Federal regulation
at 30 CFR 772.15(b), which implements SMCRA and corresponds to Utah's proposed rule, provides that information shall
be kept confidential if (1) the person submitting it requests in writing at the time of submission that it not be disclosed
and (2) the information concerns trade secrets or is privileged commercial or financial information relating to
the competitive rights of the persons intending to conduct coal exploration.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reference to the ``Federal Act'' in proposed Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200 lacks specificity and could
be interpreted in a manner that is inconsistent with the second part of 30 CFR 772.15(b), which requires that information
can be kept confidential only if it concerns trade secrets or is privileged commercial or financial information relating
to the competitive rights of the persons intending to conduct coal exploration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, for the reasons stated above, approves proposed Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, but requires
Utah to submit an additional amendment providing that coal exploration permit application information may not be
kept confidential unless it concerns trade secrets or is privileged commercial or financial information relating
to the competitive rights of the persons intending to conduct coal exploration.

1. Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing
was held.

2. Agency Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on Utah's proposed amendment from the Administrator
of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and various
other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Utah program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_By letter dated October 7, 1993, MSHA raised a concern that in one area Utah's proposed rules may conflict with MSHA's
30 CFR part 77 regulations (administrative record No. UT&hyph;873). MSHA stated that the proposed rules refer to
tables and charts regarding allowable airblast, ground vibration, and particle velocity due to surface blasting
but that MSHA's regulations do not specify and/or limit these values for surface blasting. MSHA also stated that,
in addition, its regulation at 30 CFR 77.1303(j) provides for the protection of underground miners when surface blasting
occurs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to MSHA's statement that its regulations at 30 CFR part 77 do not limit surface mines for airblast, ground
vibration, and particle velocity, the Director, as discussed in finding No. 2, finds that Utah's surface mining blasting
limitations at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661 are substantively identical to, and no less effective
than, OSM's regulations at 30 CFR 816.67(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to MSHA's statement that its regulation at 30 CFR 77.1303(j) provides for the protection of underground
miners when surface blasting occurs, the Director notes that existing rules in the Utah program, and the corresponding
Federal regulations, provide for such protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to MSHA's implication that Utah's surface mine blasting rules should also provide protection for underground
miners, Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;524 and 524.641, and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.61(d)(1)(ii)
and 816.67(d)(1), require that (1) blasting operations conducted within 500 feet of active underground mines must
have MSHA approval and (2) underground mines must be protected from damage by establishment of a maximum allowable
limit for ground vibration before initiation of blasting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, the Director is not requiring Utah to modify its rules in response to MSHA's comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated February 28, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;896), MSHA responded to the revisions proposed
by Utah in its January 7, 1994, submittal (administrative record No. UT&hyph;881), by stating that ``it appears there
is no conflict with the requirements of 30 CFR.''

Other Agencies.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_By letters dated August 25, 1993, and January 27, 1994, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stated that it found the changes
to Utah's regulatory program to be satisfactory (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;863 and UT&hyph;890).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated August 26, 1993, the Bureau of Mines stated that it had no comment because the amendment would not affect
minerals other than coal (administrative record No. UT&hyph;864).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letters dated August 27, 1993, and February 1, 1994 (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;867 and UT&hyph;892),
EPA stated that it had no comments on the proposed amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated February 14, 1994, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stated it found nothing of significant concern
to the Fish and Wildlife Service (administrative record No. UT&hyph;895).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to solicit the written concurrence of the Administrator
of EPA with respect to those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards
promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the revisions that Utah proposed to make in its rules pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore,
OSM did not request EPA's concurrence with the proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;857).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), the Director provided the proposed amendment to the SHPO and the ACHP for comment.

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves, with an additional requirement, the proposed amendment that
Utah submitted on August 2, 1993, as subsequently revised on January 7, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in finding Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the Director approves Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;441, 645&hyph;301&hyph;731.760,
645&hyph;302&hyph;323.310; 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661; 641&hyph;112; 645&hyph;100&hyph;500; and 645&hyph;302&hyph;314.110.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in finding No. 6, the Director approves Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200 but requires Utah to revise
it to provide that coal exploration permit application information may not be kept confidential unless it concerns
trade secrets or is privileged commercial or financial information relating to the competitive rights of the persons
intending to conduct coal exploration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director approves the rules as proposed by Utah with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical
form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 944, codifying decisions concerning the Utah program, are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12886 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1291(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 550 (the
``Regulations''), to add new entries to appendices A and B. Appendix A, Organizations Determined to be Within the
Term ``Government of Libya'' (Specially Designated Nationals of Libya), is a list of organizations determined by
the Director of FAC to be within the definition of the term ``Government of Libya,'' as set forth in &sect;550.304(a)
of the Regulations, because they are owned or controlled by or act or purport to act directly or indirectly on behalf
of the Government of Libya. Appendix B, Individuals Determined to be Specially Designated Nationals of the Government
of Libya, lists individuals determined by the Director of FAC to be acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly
on behalf of the Government of Libya, and thus to fall within the term ``Government of Libya'' in &sect;550.304(a).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A to part 550 is amended to provide public notice of the designation of Arab Turkish Bank, Libya Insurance
Company, Maghreban International Trade Company, Saving and Real Estate Investment Bank, and Societe Maghrebine
d'Investissement et de Participation as Specially Designated Nationals of Libya. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B to part 550 is amended to provide public notice of nine individuals determined to be Specially Designated
Nationals of the Government of Libya: Yousef Abd&hyph;El&hyph;Razegh Abdelmulla, Ayad S. Dahaim, El Hadi M. El&hyph;Fighi,
Kamel El&hyph;Khallas, Mohammed Mustafa Ghadban, Mohammed Lahmar, Ragiab Saad Madi, Bashir M. Sharif, and Kassem
M. Sherlala. Six of these individuals are present or former directors or managers of Arab Turkish Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All prohibitions in the Regulations pertaining to the Government of Libya apply to the entities and individuals identified
in appendices A and B. All unlicensed transactions with such entities or persons, or transactions in property in which
they have an interest, are prohibited unless otherwise exempted or generally licensed in the Regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determinations that persons fall within the definition of the term ``Government of Libya'' and are thus Specially
Designated Nationals are effective upon the date of determination by the Director of FAC, acting under authority
delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury. Public notice of such a determination is effective upon the date of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication or upon earlier actual notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The list of Specially Designated Nationals in appendices A and B is a partial one, since FAC may not be aware of all agencies
and officers of the Government of Libya, or of all persons that might be owned or controlled by, or acting on behalf of
the Government of Libya within the meaning of &sect;550.304(a). Therefore, one may not rely on the fact that a person
is not listed in appendix A or B as a Specially Designated National as evidence that it is not owned or controlled by,
or acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on behalf of, the Government of Libya. The Treasury Department
regards it as incumbent upon all persons governed by the Regulations to take reasonable steps to ascertain for themselves
whether persons with whom they deal are owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act on behalf of, the Government
of Libya, or on behalf of other countries subject to blocking or transactional restrictions administered by FAC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1705, provides for civil penalties not
to exceed $10,000 for each violation of the Regulations. Criminal violations of the Regulations are punishable by
fines of up to $250,000 or imprisonment for up to 10 years per count, or both, for individuals and criminal fines of up
to $500,000 per count for organizations. See 50 U.S.C. 1705; 18 U.S.C. 3571.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its adjudication regulations concerning income exclusions
in death cases. The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that secured debts cannot be considered ``just debts''
for purposes of the income exclusion.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rates payable under VA's income-based benefit programs, pension and parents' dependency and indemnity compensation,
are affected by the claimant's income. As countable income goes up, the rate payable goes down. The law does, however,
provide certain exclusions from countable income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
38 U.S.C. 1503(a)(3) excludes amounts paid by a surviving spouse or child of a deceased veteran for the veteran's just
debts from countable income; 38 U.S.C. 1315(f)(1)(H) provides a similar exclusion for a dependent parent of a deceased
veteran who pays a deceased spouse's just debts. The term ``just debts,'' however, is not currently defined by statute
or regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a precedent opinion dated August 5, 1993 (OGC Prec 5&hyph;93), VA's General Counsel held that amounts paid by a surviving
spouse on secured obligations incurred for the purchase of real or personal property could not be excluded as ``just
debts'' under 38 U.S.C. 1503(a)(3)(A). Based on the principles in OGC Prec 5&hyph;93, we have amended 38 CFR 3.262(m),
3.262(o), and 3.272(h) to state that the term ``just debts'' does not include secured debts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612.
The reason for this certification is that these amendments would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these amendments are exempt from the initial
and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of section 603 and 604.

 Florida has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA). Florida's revisions consist of the provisions contained in the rules promulgated between
July 1, 1989, and June 30, 1990, otherwise known as Non-HSWA Cluster VI. These requirements are listed in Section B
of this notice. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Florida's application and has made a decision,
subject to public review and comment, that the Florida hazardous waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements
necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Florida's hazardous waste program revisions.
Florida's application for program revisions is available for public review and comment.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with final authorization under Section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure,
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'')
allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements
promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the
HSWA requirements under Section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the
HSWA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR Parts 260&hyph;268 and 124 and 270.

B. Florida 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Florida initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on February 12, 1985, (50 FR 3908,
January 29, 1985). Florida received authorization for revisions to its program on April 6, 1992, for Non-HSWA III,
IV, and V, and on January 10, 1994 for HSWA I without Corrective Action. Today, Florida is seeking approval of its program
revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed Florida's application and has made an immediate final decision that Florida's hazardous waste program
revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends
to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to Florida. The public may submit written
comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until August 10, 1994. Copies of Florida's application for these program
revisions are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Addresses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of Florida's program revisions shall become effective September 9, 1994, unless an adverse comment pertaining
to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice
containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses
the decision.

C. Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that Florida's application for these program revisions meet all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Florida is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised, except where otherwise noted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and
carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitations of its program revision application, its
previously approved authorities and where otherwise noted in this Notice. Florida also has primary enforcement
responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under Section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement
actions under Sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA.

Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Florida's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

By virtue of the authority vested in the Secretary of the Interior by Section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management
Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1714 (1988), it is ordered as follows:

under the agricultural land laws and location under the United States mining laws (30 U.S.C. Ch. 2 (1988)), but not
from leasing under the mineral leasing laws, to protect the land while the State of California conducts a study of the
area to determine the feasibility of locating the proposed Ward Valley Low-Level Radioactive Waste Facility at the
site, and for other purposes:

1. The United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard) filed a petition (RM&hyph;8008), Public Notice No. 1894, requesting
that the Commission amend Part 80 of the Rules, 47 CFR Part 80, to require registration of emergency position indicating
radiobeacons (EPIRBs) operating on the frequency 406.025 MHz with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA). Additionally, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in PR Docket No. 92&hyph;125 (58 FR 30126, 5/26/93), the Commission stated that it would address separately the issue
of mandatory registration of emergency locator transmitters (ELTs) operating on the frequency 406.025 MHz in the
Aviation Services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Beacon registration is essential to realize the full benefit of the 406 MHz satellite system. The Air Force, Coast
Guard, NOAA and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) agree that having access to registration information
along with the improved location accuracy of the 406 MHz system can result in a reduction of the time needed to complete
a SAR operation. NOAA and NASA estimate that registration will save on average 6 hours per mission. Further, NOAA states
that its experience with voluntary registration of 406 EPIRBs shows that when 406 EPIRBs are registered in its database
the Coast Guard has been able to avoid unnecessarily using SAR resources by screening false distress signals through
telephone calls to registered owners. Typical mission costs of launching a single helicopter to locate and investigate
a distress signal are approximately $4,000. The potential savings to the Federal government and SAR forces are substantial
with no additional cost or burden to manufacturers and little burden to beacon users. The beacon user would be required
to mail to NOAA the pre-paid, pre-addressed post card that the manufacturers currently provide requesting registration
information. In view of the strong support, and because beacon registration can provide valuable distress information
to SAR personnel concerning the type and size of the aircraft/vessel as well as prevent launching potentially dangerous
missions on false distress signals, we will require that 406 MHz ELTs and 406 MHz EPIRBs be registered in NOAA's database.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. We certify that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply to this rule making proceeding because if the
proposed rule amendments are promulgated, there will not be a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small business entities, as defined by Section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The change proposed herein
will have a beneficial effect on the marine and aviation community by enhancing information available to SAR personnel
for use in distress situations and will not have a significant economic impact on any entity. The Secretary shall send
a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rule Making, including the certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the
Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Pub. L. No.
96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612 (1980).

 NMFS publishes this interpretive rule to clarify the definition of the landing requirement in Federal regulations
implementing the Fishery Management Plan for the Crustacean Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region (FMP). The purpose
of this action is to remove an unintended barrier to fishermen who might have difficulty renewing their limited entry
permits because there was no quota in 1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The final rule implementing Amendment 7 (57 FR 10437, March 26, 1992) to the FMP established a limited entry program
for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Among the provisions implemented was the establishment of a landing requirement
for renewing permits each year. The Code of Federal Regulations at 50 CFR 681.30(c)(2) states that a permit will be
renewed for a subsequent year only if the permitted vessel was used to: (i) land the equivalent of at least four lobsters
for each trap normally used, calculated over 1 calendar year [the landing requirement] and (ii) make the landings
during at least one of the 2 years prior to the year for which the new permit would be valid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a permit were not renewed or were revoked, others could apply for the unused permit. The purpose of the rule was to
ensure that only active fishermen held permits, thereby achieving the maximum benefit from the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permit holders were notified by letter in December 1992 that the 1992 fishing year would be the first year to be considered
as a qualifying year. However, in 1993, the quota was set at zero lobsters because the resource was not of a sufficient
size to support a fishery. As a result, those fishermen who had not fished in 1992 would have been required by Federal
regulations to land a minimum number of lobsters in 1993 to obtain a permit for the 1994 fishing season, but also were
forbidden by Federal regulations to fish. Therefore, the rule is being amended to make the regulations clear that
the landing requirement: (1) will not apply until at least 2 years of lobster fishing has occurred beginning in 1992;
and (2) must be met in one of the 2 most recent years in which lobster fishing under the limited entry program was authorized.
Since lobster fishing under the limited entry program was authorized in 1992, and will be authorized in 1994, the landing
requirement will first be applied to permit renewals for the 1995 lobster season.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 523 of NAFTA amended section 6302 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code) by enacting a new subsection (h)
authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the development and
implementation of an electronic funds transfer (EFT) system to be used for the collection of depository taxes. The
depository taxes are the taxes required to be deposited with an authorized financial institution or Federal Reserve
bank pursuant to any regulations prescribed by the Secretary (generally FICA and railroad retirement taxes, income
tax withheld, corporate income and estimated taxes, and various Federal excise taxes). The new system will be designed
to ensure that the depository taxes are credited to the Treasury's general account by the due date of the deposit.

A. Current Tax Deposit System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At present, taxpayers are required to deposit taxes with an authorized government depository (generally, a commercial
bank or savings institution or a Federal Reserve bank) by various dates specified in regulations. Each deposit must
be accompanied by Form 8109, Federal Tax Deposit Coupon, which contains the taxpayer's name, identification number,
the amount and type of tax being deposited, and the tax period for which the deposit is being made. The government depository
forwards the coupon to the appropriate IRS Service Center. The Service Center compares the information entered on
the coupon with the liabilities reported by the taxpayer on the return for the applicable tax period. The funds are
transferred by the depository to the Treasury on the business date following the date of the deposit.

B. An Electronic Tax Deposit System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6302(h) of the Code authorizes a new system which will allow for the transfer of tax deposit amounts electronically
from taxpayer accounts to the Treasury's general account. The new system will be phased in over a period of several
fiscal years, beginning with fiscal year 1994 (October 1, 1993, to September 30, 1994), by gradually increasing the
percentage of the total depository taxes required to be collected by EFT. The temporary regulations implement this
phase-in by gradually increasing the number of taxpayers that must deposit all of their depository taxes by EFT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement to deposit by EFT under these temporary regulations applies only to those taxpayers required to make
deposits pursuant to regulations under section 6302 of the Code, and only for those taxes required to be deposited.
At present, many small taxpayers are excluded from the various deposit requirements imposed by regulations under
section 6302. For example, filers of Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return, are not required to make deposits
for any calendar quarter in which the net tax liability reported on the Form 720 does not exceed $2,000. Similarly,
filers of Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, are not required to make deposits for any calendar quarter
in which the liability reported on the Form 941 is less than $500.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The temporary regulations, with one exception, do not apply to taxes with respect to wages for domestic service in
the private home of an employer because these taxes are not required to be deposited but are remitted quarterly with
Form 942, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return for Household Employees. The sole exception is if the employer
is a sole proprietor filing Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, who chooses to report wages to household
employees on that form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to achieve an expedited and orderly conversion to an EFT system, NAFTA prescribed a schedule of minimum percentages
of taxes that must be deposited by EFT during a phase-in period. These percentages depend in part on whether the taxes
are: (a) The taxes imposed by chapters 21 (Federal Insurance Contributions Act), 22 (Railroad Retirement Tax Act),
and 24 (Collection of Income Tax at Source on Wages) of the Code, or (b) ``other'' depository taxes (generally corporate
income taxes and various excise taxes). The statutorily prescribed minimum percentages for each year are as follows:

For the period prior to January 1, 1995, the first step of the phase-in of the EFT system will be carried out through binding
agreements entered into between the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and certain third party bulk data processors
(processors) under which the processors have committed to make deposits of Federal depository taxes of certain of
their customers by EFT in such a manner as to ensure that the amounts are credited to the general account of the Treasury
by the deposit due date. These agreements will take effect beginning in the latter part of fiscal year 1994 and will
continue for a period of time into fiscal year 1995. A taxpayer who is a customer of a processor that is a party to one of
these agreements may have its deposits that are subject to such an agreement made by the processor pursuant to the terms
of the agreement until the expiration or termination of the agreement. However, the taxpayer continues to be responsible
for the deposit of those depository taxes that are not subject to such agreement. If a taxpayer whose deposits are being
made by a processor pursuant to such an agreement becomes required to deposit by electronic funds transfer pursuant
to &sect;31.6302&hyph;1T(h)(1)(ii) of these temporary regulations, the taxpayer is responsible for making deposits
by electronic funds transfer of those depository taxes not subject to the agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For periods after December 31, 1994, the temporary regulations require that deposits be made by EFT based on the taxpayer's
total deposits of taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, and 24 during certain ``determination'' periods. If a taxpayer's
total deposits of the taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, and 24 during the determination period exceed a prescribed
dollar threshold, the taxpayer must begin depositing by EFT on and after the applicable effective date prescribed
in the regulations, unless otherwise exempted. (A taxpayer will become subject to the EFT requirement for the applicable
effective date ``January 1, 1996'' by exceeding the threshold amount during either calendar years 1993 or 1994).
The phase-in schedule is as follows:

The thresholds set forth in this phase-in schedule have been set by taking into account the minimum percentages prescribed
by NAFTA, the need for administrative convenience and simplicity, and the potential need for exemptions from the
EFT system for certain small businesses. Therefore, the thresholds for the January 1, 1995 and January 1, 1996 effective
dates were specifically set to satisfy the statutory minimum percentages. The $50,000 threshold for the January
1, 1997 effective date will result in receipts of depository taxes somewhat in excess of the percentage prescribed
by NAFTA. For purposes of administrative convenience and simplicity, this threshold was adopted to require the participation
of an entire class of taxpayers, that is, those taxpayers that are classified as ``semi-weekly'' depositors of employment
taxes (the taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, and 24). Finally, the $20,000 threshold for the January 1, 1999 effective
date was set to satisfy the statutory percentage while allowing for the possibility that the smallest of depositors
will be exempted from the EFT system. As described in paragraph C of this preamble, the IRS solicits comments on the
impact of these regulations on small businesses. Based on those comments, the IRS will determine those categories
of small businesses, if any, that should be exempted from the EFT requirements, and may adjust the threshold for the
January 1, 1999 effective date to bring in additional taxpayers while at the same time accommodating any appropriate
exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although only the taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, and 24 are used to determine whether a taxpayer is subject to the
EFT deposit requirement, the requirement, once triggered, applies to all federal taxes (not just the taxes imposed
by chapters 21, 22, and 24) that the taxpayer is required to deposit pursuant to regulations prescribed under section
6302 of the Code. Once a taxpayer becomes subject to the EFT deposit requirement, the taxpayer must continue to deposit
by EFT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present the IRS has in place a voluntary electronic funds transfer (EFT) system in which a taxpayer may by telephone
or computer effectuate an electronic funds transfer through the use of one of two payment options: debit and credit.
The debit option is effected by using a Financial Agent of the Department of Treasury. The taxpayer requests the Financial
Agent to initiate the transfer of funds from the taxpayer's bank account(s) to Treasury's general account and transmit
the related tax payment data, supplied by the taxpayer, to the IRS. The credit option is effected by using the taxpayer's
financial institution. The taxpayer requests the financial institution to initiate the transfer of funds to the
Treasury's general account and submit the related tax data, supplied by the taxpayer, to a Financial Agent for transmission
to the IRS. The EFT system required to be used in connection with these regulations will employ similar options and
procedures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6302(h)(1)(B) of the Code, as added by NAFTA, provides that the regulations may contain such exemptions as
the Secretary may deem appropriate. The Senate Report accompanying section 6302(h) strongly encourages the Secretary
of the Treasury to consider the impact of the regulations on small businesses. S. Rep. No. 103&hyph;189, 103d Cong.,
1st Sess., at 61 et. seq. (1993). The report recommends that the regulations should not create hardships for small
businesses and that no small business should be required to purchase computers or gain access to any electronic equipment
other than a touch-tone telephone. Further, the report urges the Secretary to take into account the specific needs
of small employers, including possible exemption for the very smallest businesses from the new electronic funds
transfer system. The phase-in schedule included in the temporary regulations defers use of the EFT system by the smallest
businesses until at least calendar year 2000. The IRS welcomes comments about the impact of the temporary regulations
on small businesses and will consider any suggestions regarding how small businesses should be treated under the
regulations in order to implement Congressional intent. Based on the comments and suggestions received, the IRS
will determine those categories of small businesses, if any, that should be exempted from the EFT requirements and
publish such determinations in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. (See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that these temporary regulations are not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866.
Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, a copy of these regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Internal Revenue Code requires the Secretary to prescribe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations as may be necessary for the development and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of an electronic funds transfer system to be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the collection of depository taxes as described in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h)(2) of this section. Section 6302(h)(2) of the Code provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a phase-in schedule which sets forth escalating minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentages of those depository taxes to be deposited by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic funds transfer, starting with the fiscal year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning October 1, 1993, and ending September 30, 1994. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section prescribes the rules necessary for implementing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic funds transfer system for collection of depository 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxes and for effecting an orderly and expeditious phase-in of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Commissioner of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue has entered into binding agreements with third 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party bulk data processors. These agreements require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third party bulk processors deposit certain depository taxes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain of their customers by electronic funds transfer in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner designed to ensure that those amounts are credited to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general account of the Treasury by the deposit due date. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer who is a customer of a third party bulk data processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is a party to such an agreement may have its deposits that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are subject to such agreement made by the processor until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration or termination of the agreement. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer continues to be responsible for the deposit of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depository taxes that are not subject to such agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 24 (Collection of Income Tax at Source on Wages) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Code during a 12-month determination period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed the applicable threshold amount are required to deposit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all depository taxes (as described in paragraph (h)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section) due on and after the applicable effective date by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electronic funds transfer (as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section) unless exempted under paragraph (h)(4) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, each applicable effective date has one 12-month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination period. However, for the applicable effective date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1996, there are two determination periods. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable threshold amount is exceeded in either of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination periods, the taxpayer becomes subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer, effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1996. The threshold amounts, determination periods, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and applicable effective dates are as follows:

funds transfer pursuant to paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the taxpayer will continue to deposit by electronic funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer. Until such time as a taxpayer is required by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section to deposit by electronic funds transfer, the taxpayer may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntarily make deposits by electronic funds transfer, or must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on Pre-Release Program (28 CFR part 571, subpart A), which will now
be entitled Release Preparation Program. A final rule on this subject was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 June 30, 1980 (45 FR 44234) and was amended on September 30, 1983 (48 FR 45053). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary change in these amendments is to provide for greater standardization in release preparation programming
at Bureau institutions. New section 571.13 contains the core curriculum of topics/courses to be offered. Other amendments
are primarily editorial in nature and make no change in the intent of the regulations. For ease of use, the entire subpart
is being revised. A summary of the changes follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the title of the program has been changed from ``pre-release program'' to ``release preparation program''.
This change is reflected in revised &sect;571.10, &sect;571.11 (b) and (d) (formerly &sect;571.11(a) (2) and (4)),
&sect;571.12 (a) and (b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 571.10 is further amended to reflect the Bureau's recognition of the continuity of an inmate's needs for release
preparation and to standardize the release preparation program for all sentenced inmates reintegrating into the
community from Bureau facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 571.11 is further amended by adjusting the codification for the purpose of editorial consistency. Former
paragraph (a)(1) has been removed. This provision is addressed more completely in new &sect;571.13 (b). As revised,
the introductory text and paragraph (a) of new &sect;571.11 specify that a designated staff member has the responsibility
to determine the general release needs of the inmate population. These provisions replace the provisions of former
paragraphs (a) introductory text and (a)(2). Former paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) are revised as paragraphs (b) and (d),
and a new paragraph (c) is added specifying that the designated staff member chairs the institution's Release Preparation
Program Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;571.12, paragraph (b) has been revised to remove reference to requirements for inmate participation in
a specific number of sessions. The intent of the revised paragraph is that the inmate is responsible for registering
in recommended release preparation courses. Documentation of the inmate's participation in the program serves
to help staff measure the institutional adjustment of the inmate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions in former paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of &sect;571.12 have been revised as paragraphs (c), (d), and
(e) of a new &sect;571.13 on the institution release preparation program. New paragraph (a) of &sect;571.13 specifies
that the institution's release preparation program shall be administered by the Release Preparation Program Committee.
New paragraph (b) of &sect;571.13 states the core curriculum of the institution program: health and nutrition, employment,
personal finance/consumer skills, information/community resources, release requirements and procedures, and
personal growth and development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because these changes are administrative in nature and do not impose further restrictions on inmates, the Bureau
finds good cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice
of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public comment, and delay in effective date. Members of the public may
submit comments concerning this rule by writing to the previously cited address. These comments will be considered
but will receive no response in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

(e) An inmate who is not being released through a Community Corrections Center (CCC) may ask staff to request the assistance
of a United States Probation Officer in establishing a release plan. Bureau staff are to encourage the inmate to give
at least one employment lead or contact. Where the inmate or the inmate's family has already identified employment,
the case manager shall notify the United States Probation Officer so that the usual verification of release plans
may be made. Where employment has not been identified, the case manager shall notify the United States Probation Officer
of the employment need. This notification should ordinarily occur at least six weeks prior to the inmate's release.
