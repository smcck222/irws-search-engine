SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) is proposing to increase fees charged warehousemen
for licensing and inspection services under the United States Warehouse Act (USWA) for grain, tobacco, wool, dry
beans, nuts, syrup, and cottonseed. In addition, an initial schedule of fees for cotton warehousemen is being added.
Future fee changes will be announced by a notice in the

It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to this proposed rule because it has been
determined that this rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small businesses because licensing
under the United States Warehouse Act is strictly voluntary on the part of the warehouseman. The actions taken herein
are required by statute.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 requires the imposition of fees for federally licensed warehouses.
That Act stipulates that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary of Agriculture *&blank;*&blank;* shall charge, assess, and cause to be collected a reasonable fee
for (1) each examination or inspection of a warehouse *&blank;*&blank;*; (2) each license issued to any person to
classify, inspect, grade, sample, or weigh agricultural products stored or to be stored *&blank;*&blank;*; (3)
each annual warehouse license issued to a warehouseman to conduct a warehouse *&blank;*&blank;*; and (4) each warehouse
license amended, modified, extended, or reinstated *&blank;*&blank;*. Such fees shall cover, as nearly as practicable,
the costs of providing such services and licenses *&blank;*&blank;* including administrative and supervisory
costs *&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would add to and change the fees charged and collected, discontinue publication of fee amounts
in the Regulations for Warehouses (7 CFR, chapter VII, subchapter c), and allow fees to be adjusted annually in order
to cover program costs. Fees that will be charged beginning October 1, 1994, are contained below. When subsequent
fee changes become necessary, fees will be announced prior to July 1, to be effective the following October 1, by Notice
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. ASCS' goal is to have the added and revised fees implemented at the beginning of fiscal year 1995 due to the projection
of a continued shortfall in the USWA user fee account. Annual program obligations require about $3.5 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If public comment leads the agency to reject fee increases, other methods of statutory compliance would be required
such as severe manpower and service adjustments. Any changes must be implemented by October 1, 1994. Because of budget
constraints, it is imperative that ASCS implement a final rule before October 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASCS will consider all comments received regardless of whether the comment addresses the addition, increase, or
the method by which fees will be announced. ASCS is requesting a 15-day comment period. Good cause is shown for a priority
notice and comment period of less than 60 days, because ASCS must implement these fees for 1995 fiscal year. Affected
parties should not be disadvantaged, because ASCS issued a Notice requesting comments in the

 on August 20, 1993 (58 FR 44320), and held several meetings with various warehousing organizations. These organizations
have alerted their members and others as to the effect of this rule.

Proposed Warehouse and Service License Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Warehouse license fees for cotton, grain, tobacco, wool, dry beans, nut, syrup, and cottonseed are proposed to be
increased from $50 to $65. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service license fees issued to individuals and entities to inspect, sample, grade, classify, or weigh commodities
are proposed to be increased from $20 to $26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Proposed Warehouse Annual and Inspection Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The annual and inspection fees are outlined in the following tables by the agricultural product stored. The inspection
fees are based on licensing a first-time applicant and adding space to an existing license. The purpose of the inspection
fee is to cover the cost of licensing space while the annual fee is applicable to performing unannounced inspection
and is assessed independently of the inspection fee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule invites comments on the establishment of a minimum size requirement of 11 row size (61/64 inch diameter)
and a minimum maturity requirement of 17 percent soluble solids for Rainier variety cherries that can be shipped to
fresh market outlets under Marketing Order No. 923. This proposed rule would ensure that consumers receive cherries
of acceptable size and maturity. This is intended to enhance the quality and image of Washington Rainier cherries
in the fresh market, thereby increasing sales and improving returns to producers. This proposed rule was recommended
by the Washington Cherry Marketing Committee (committee), which works with the Department of Agriculture (Department)
in administering the marketing order covering sweet cherries grown in designated counties in Washington.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 923 (7 CFR Part 923), regulating the
handling of sweet cherries grown in designated counties in Washington, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.''
The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674],
hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 50 handlers of Washington sweet cherries that are subject to regulation under the order.
In addition, there are approximately 1,100 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms, which
include handlers of Washington sweet cherries, have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601]
as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $500,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal invites comments on the establishment of a minimum size requirement of 11 row (61/64 inch diameter)
and a minimum maturity requirement of 17 percent soluble solids for Rainier variety cherries under the order. The
committee recommended these minimum size and maturity requirements by a vote of 13 to 1.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 923.52 of the order authorizes the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container regulations
for any variety or varieties of cherries grown in the production area. Section 923.53 further authorizes the modification,
suspension, or termination of regulations issued under &sect;923.52. Section 923.55 provides that whenever cherries
are regulated pursuant to &sect;923.52 or &sect;923.53, such cherries must be inspected by the Federal-State Inspection
Service, and certified as meeting the applicable requirements of such regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the regulations require that dark sweet cherries such as Bing cherries, the predominant variety grown
in the production area, meet certain grade, size, pack and container requirements. Such cherries are also required
to be inspected. Light sweet cherries, including the Rainier variety, are currently exempt from these requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rainier variety was developed at Washington State University's Irrigated Agricultural Research and Extension
Center in Prosser, Washington, and was first released to the Northwest cherry industry in 1960. Rainiers were initially
used primarily as canning cherries. However, since the 1980s, production of the Rainier variety for the fresh market
has increased substantially. Less than 600 tons were marketed fresh in 1987, but that increased to 1,543 tons in 1989
and 1,937 tons in 1992. A record crop of 2,427 tons was marketed in 1993, about 5 percent of Washington's total sweet
cherry crop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the Rainier variety gained in importance as a fresh market cherry, the Washington cherry industry began to consider
the need to establish minimum standards of size and quality for the variety. At its December 15, 1993, meeting, the
committee made its first recommendation to regulate Rainier cherries. Specifically, the committee recommended
that a minimum size requirement be established at 101/2 row size (1 inch in diameter) for fresh market shipments of
Rainier variety cherries. No minimum maturity requirement was recommended at that time, although concerns were
expressed about ensuring that only ripe cherries be marketed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the December meeting, the Department received correspondence from 19 cherry producers, packers,
and marketers concerning the committee's recommended regulation. The majority (13 of 19) were in favor of the recommendation,
and 6 were in opposition to regulating the Rainier variety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments supporting the proposed minimum size requirement stated that such a regulation would be in the best interests
of producers. Growing Rainier cherries is more labor intensive and costly than producing other varieties. Producers
need to offer a quality product in order to recoup these higher production costs. The sale of small, immature cherries
results in buyer dissatisfaction, which reduces repeat purchases and damages the market for all cherries. Good cultural
practices (e.g., proper pruning) will result in acceptable sizes. Fruit quality and maturity are enhanced by fruit
size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those opposed to the recommendation stated that it would reduce the volume of Rainier cherries permitted to be marketed
fresh, thus reducing returns on the crop. Further, they stated that taste and appearance are more important to cherry
buyers than size. Those in opposition also claimed that a minimum size requirement would be detrimental to producers
who farm at higher elevations, where fruit tends to be smaller, but may be sweeter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the lack of industry consensus on this issue, the Department asked the committee to reconsider the need to regulate
Rainier variety cherries, particularly in light of the concerns raised in the above-mentioned letters. The committee
met again on March 15, 1994, and rescinded its earlier recommendation. The committee recommended a lower size requirement_at
least 11 row size (61/64 inch in diameter)_coupled with a minimum maturity requirement of 17 percent soluble solids.
The vote on this recommendation was 13 to 1, with the dissenting voter in favor of a smaller minimum size of 111/2 row
(57/64 inch in diameter). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rainier cherry is distinct from other cherry varieties marketed by the Washington cherry industry. It is a yellow-colored
cherry, with some rosy blush. It is considered a specialty item, compared with the darker colored varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee reports the costs of producing and handling Rainier cherries are higher than those associated with
other cherry varieties. Rainier cherry trees need to be pruned more heavily than other cherry trees to ensure acceptable
sized fruit. Rainier cherry trees are picked several times during a season, reflecting the fact that not all the fruit
matures at the same time and that the cherries will not ripen after harvest. Rainier are also fragile and susceptible
to damage during handling. Thus, most Rainier cherries are sorted and packed by hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rainier cherries are typically marketed from mid-June through July. AMS Market News data show that prices are highest
for the earliest offerings of these cherries, and that such prices decline as the season progresses. In 1992, for example,
the opening f.o.b. price on June 18 was $35.00 per carton. This declined to $25.00 to $28.00 per carton a week later,
and f.o.b. prices were $22.00 to $28.00 per carton at season's end. This price trend serves as an incentive for producers
to harvest early, which has resulted in immature, sour Rainier cherries being marketed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The committee reports that cherry size and quality are important to buyers. Consistency and dependability are equally
important. Shipments of immature, low quality, under-sized Rainier cherries in recent seasons have resulted in
disappointment by buyers and consumers. This reduces repeat purchases, and results in declines in prices and overall
sales volumes. The general consensus of the industry is that some mandatory quality standards are needed to ensure
buyer confidence. Voluntary standards have been unsuccessful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cherry size is related to maturity and other quality factors. That is, larger sized cherries tend to be sweeter and
of higher overall quality. This is supported by prices received for different sizes of Bing cherries. Market News
data show that f.o.b. prices for 12 row sized Bings (54/64 inch diameter) averaged about $15.00 per carton in mid-June
1992. At the same time, 101/2 row sized (1 inch diameter) Bings were selling for about $25.00 per carton. This price
relationship held steady throughout the season. Further, the committee has conducted research that shows that larger
sizes correlate with higher maturity levels, and that larger sizes are preferred by cherry consumers. While research
results and prices by size specifically for Rainier variety cherries are currently unavailable, industry consensus
is that the same relationships are true for Rainier cherries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Washington cherry industry promotes the sale of Rainier through the Washington State Fruit Commission (WSFC),
a State research and promotion program funded by industry assessments. The WSFC publicizes the current voluntary
1-inch minimum size standard for Rainier variety cherries in its promotion efforts. The WSFC has reported that it
receives buyer complaints when such standards are not upheld. For example, three large retail chains cancelled all
of their in-store promotions of Rainiers planned for the 1993 season due to the receipt of small, immature Rainier
cherries early in the season. Thus, the industry believes it needs to establish minimum size and maturity standards
to protect its investment in promoting the crop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general consensus of the Washington cherry industry is that the shipment of poor quality Rainier cherries is disrupting
the marketplace and that some minimum quality standards are needed to maintain the Rainier cherry market. However,
some disagreement was expressed at the committee meeting as to precisely what those minimum standards should be.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some questioned, for example, the 101/2 row size requirement initially recommended by the committee, saying that
this requirement would result in too many cherries being diverted to processors (an outlet exempt from regulation).
Others stated that the smaller 11 row cherries have adequate sugar content. Still others opposed any size requirement,
believing that other criteria (e.g., maturity levels) are more important than size and that size bears no relationship
to those criteria. Additionally, concern was expressed that producers at higher elevations would be more adversely
impacted than other producers by a minimum size requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regards to this last concern, the committee concluded that producers at higher elevations should not be adversely
impacted by the 11 row minimum size regulation, since these producers have demonstrated the ability to produce other
varieties at acceptable sizes (e.g., Bing cherries). Further, a number of producers who farm at higher elevations
attended the meeting, and stated that they would not have a problem meeting the proposed minimum size requirement,
and that proper cultural practices (including pruning) would ensure that other producers achieve appropriate sizing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an attempt to reach an industry compromise, the committee rescinded its December recommendation to establish
a minimum size requirement for Rainier cherries at 101/2 row size. It recommended instead a lower minimum size requirement
of 11 row, coupled with a maturity requirement of at least 17 per cent soluble solids. This recommendation is considered
to be conservative, in that most handlers in the Washington cherry industry pack to higher standards. The committee
intends to conduct research during the 1994 and subsequent seasons to determine whether further refinements in Rainier
variety cherry standards are needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule proposes adding a new provision to &sect;923.322, Washington Cherry Regulation 22, to establish a minimum
size requirement of 61/64 inch in diameter for Rainier variety cherries, which corresponds to the 11 row size. To provide
for variances in packing, a tolerance of 10 percent would be provided for undersized Rainier cherries. Further, the
regulation would provide that not more than 5 percent of the Rainier cherries in any lot could be less than 57/64 inch
in diameter, which is 111/2 row size, one size lower than the 11 row size. These tolerances are comparable to those in
effect for other Washington cherry varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 923.322 would also be revised by adding a new section to require that any lot of Rainier cherries would have
to contain a minimum of 17 percent soluble solids. The percentage of soluble solids would be determined by using a refractometer
to measure the sugar level in a composite sample of cherries. This maturity test would be taken at the time of packing
or just prior to shipment, at the option of the handler.

As previously discussed, &sect;923.55 of the order provides that whenever cherries are subject to grade, size, quality,
maturity, pack or container regulations, those cherries must be inspected by the Federal-State Inspection Service
(FSIS). Since this rule would establish minimum size and maturity requirements for Rainier variety cherries, such
cherries would have to be inspected and certified by the FSIS as meeting the applicable requirements of the regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AIMS has determined that this action would not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit their views and comments on this proposal. A 15-day comment period is deemed
appropriate because the committee has held several meetings concerning the need to regulate Rainier variety cherries,
and all interested persons were invited to participate and express their opinions on this issue. In addition, to be
of maximum benefit to the industry, any regulation covering Rainier cherries should be in place for the 1994 season,
which begins in mid-June, and adequate time is needed to advise producers and shippers. All written comments timely
received will be considered before issuance of any final rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes an amendment of the Customs Regulations regarding unfair competition to reflect Customs
authority to enforce seizure and forfeiture orders issued by the United States International Trade Commission (ITC).
These orders would be issued for articles which had previously been denied entry pursuant to an ITC exclusion order.
Such seizure and forfeiture orders may be issued only when the owner, importer or consignee of such articles has previously
attempted to import articles subject to an exclusion order into the U.S.; the articles have previously been denied
entry; and the owner, importer or consignee has been notified in writing of the previous denial of entry. The proposed
amendment sets forth the procedures Customs will follow when seizures are made for violations of the ITC exclusion
orders. It also describes the appeal rights and procedures available to parties who have an interest in the seized
property.

Under &sect;337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337), the International Trade Commission applies U.S. statutory
law and the common law of unfair competition to the importation of products into the United States and their subsequent
sale in the United States. Section 337 declares unlawful unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in the importation
and sale of products in the United States, the threat or effect of which is to destroy or substantially injure a domestic
industry, prevent establishment of such an industry, or restrain or monopolize trade and commerce in the United States.
Section 337 also declares as unlawful per se infringement of a valid and enforceable U.S. patent, copyright, registered
trademark, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mask work; no resulting injury need be found. To obtain relief under section 337, the affected U.S. industry must file
a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC). A formal hearing before an administrative
law judge will then be conducted in order to determine whether a violation under section 337 exists. The administrative
law judge then issues an initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. The initial determination is subject to discretionary review by the ITC, which may affirm, reverse,
modify, set aside, or remand the initial determination to the administrative law judge for further proceedings.
If it is determined that a violation exists, the ITC may order that any articles found to be in violation of the Act be
excluded from entry into the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1342(a)(5)(B) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 amended section 337 of the Tariff Act by
inserting a new subsection (i). That subsection authorizes the ITC to issue an order providing that any article determined
to be imported in violation of the provisions of the law relating to unfair methods of competition and unfair acts in
the importation of articles into the United States should be seized and forfeited when certain conditions stated
in the law have been met. Any such order issued is to be enforced by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For such an order to be valid, the law provides that the following conditions must be met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The owner, importer, or consignee of the article must have previously attempted to import the article into the
United States; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The article must have been denied entry into the United States by reason of an order issued under 19 U.S.C. 1337 (d);
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Upon such previous denial of entry, the Secretary of the Treasury must have provided the owner, importer, or consignee

Section 12.39, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 12.39) currently describes the role of the ITC in determining whether
an importer has engaged in unfair methods of competition or practices, and the actions the ITC can order in response
to the finding of such practices. Among those actions are exclusion from entry and entry under bond of articles imported
in violation of fair trade provisions, both of which are cited in &sect;12.39(b). The authority of the ITC to exclude
articles from entry into the United States under section 337 is described in &sect;12.39(b)(1). Section 12.39(b)(2)
permits excluded articles to be entered under a single entry bond pending the finalization of the ITC determination.
Finally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;12.39(b)(3) requires, among other things, that district directors notify each importer or consignee of articles
entered under bond pursuant to &sect;12.39(b)(2) when the determination becomes final, and indicate that the entry
of articles is refused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document proposes to amend &sect;12.39(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 12.39(b)) to reflect both the authority
of the ITC to issue seizure and forfeiture orders against articles and like articles for which exclusion orders have
been issued under certain conditions and the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to enforce those orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment also sets forth the procedures that Customs, on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury, will
follow when enforcing the order. The proposed procedures provide that when the three statutory conditions are met
that allow the ITC to issue a seizure and forfeiture order, and the ITC notifies the Secretary of the Treasury of the
issuance of such order, the Assistant Commissioner, Commercial Operations, will notify all ports of entry of the
order and identify both the article subject to the order and the owners, importers or consignees who are subject to
the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These seizure orders would be issued by the ITC against specific importers, or their agents and consignees, and would
apply only to articles which have been denied entry, and for which the importer has been notified in writing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment also contains procedures that are to be followed by parties having a proprietary interest
in articles which are seized pursuant to ITC seizure orders and who wish to file a petition for relief.

Customs. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552), &sect;1.4, Treasury Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and &sect;103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19

(4) In addition to the notice given to importers or consignees of articles released under bond, district directors
shall provide written notice to all owners, importers or consignees of articles which are denied entry into the United
States pursuant to an exclusion order that any future attempt to import such articles may result in the articles being
seized and forfeited. Copies of all such notices are to be forwarded to the Commercial Compliance Branch, Office of
Trade Operations, at Customs Headquarters, and to the Office of The General Counsel, USITC, 500 E Street SW., Washington
DC 20436 by the district directors.

Seizure and Forfeiture Orders.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) In addition to issuing an exclusion order under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Commission may issue an order
providing that any article determined to be in violation of section 337 be seized and forfeited to the United States.
Such order may be issued if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The owner, importer, or consignee of the article previously attempted to import the article into the United States;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The article was previously denied entry into the United States by reason of an exclusion order issued under paragraph
(b)(1) of this section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Upon such previous denial of entry, the district director of the district in which the entry was attempted had
notified the owner, importer, or consignee of the article in writing of both the exclusion order and that seizure and
forfeiture would result from any further attempt to import the article into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Upon receipt of any seizure order issued by the Commission in accordance with this paragraph, the Assistant Commissioner,
Commercial Operations shall immediately notify all ports of entry of the property subject to the seizure order and
identify the persons notified under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The district director in the district in which the article was seized shall issue a notice of seizure to parties
known to have a proprietary interest in the seized property. All claimants to the property shall have an opportunity
to petition for relief under the provisions of 19 CFR part 171. All petitions must be filed within 30 days of the date
of issuance of the notice of seizure, and failure of a claimant to petition will result in the commencement of administrative
forfeiture proceedings. All petitions will be decided by the appropriate Customs officer, based upon the value of
the articles under seizure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If seized articles are found to be not includable in an order for seizure and forfeiture, then the seizure and the
forfeiture shall be remitted in accordance with standard Customs procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Forfeited merchandise shall be disposed of in accordance with the Customs laws.

II. Discussion of Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter of April 18, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1276), Kentucky submitted a proposed program amendment
that replaces a previous proposed program amendment dated November 17, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KY&hyph;1260).
The amendment consists of proposed new and amended statutes to KRS relating to disposal of coal combustion fly ash,
bottom ash, and scrubber sludge under special waste permit-by-rule at KRS chapter 224. The proposed amendment, known
as Senate Bill 266, was passed by Kentucky's General Assembly during the 1994 regular session. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed statutes offer surface coal mining permittees the option to dispose of coal combustion waste on the
permit area under the special waste permit-by-rule established at KRS Chapter 224. Applicants who obtain a permit
from the Cabinet's Department for Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement under these proposed revised statutes
are deemed to have received a permit from the Cabinet's Department for Environmental Protection, Division of Waste
Management, without having applied separately to the Division Of Waste Management. A person who wishes to dispose
of coal combustion waste on a surface mining permit area in a manner that is not authorized in Senate Bill 266 may, as
at present, apply separately to the Division of Waste Management for a special waste formal permit under KRS Chapter
224. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Senate Bill 266 contains the following changes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amend KRS 350.010 to define coal combustion by-products; create new sections of KRS 350 to allow the Department of
Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to issue a permit authorizing the disposal of coal combustion by-products
at surface coal mining operations; exclude from application of the Act, coal combustion by-products for which a special
waste formal permit or registered permit-by-rule is required under Chapter 224, and coal combustion by-products
that have been mixed with hazardous or low volume waste; require an application to modify an existing surface mining
permit to initially include disposal of coal combustion by-products to be a major amendment; in other cases involving
coal combustion by-products, allow for minor revisions unless the cabinet determines otherwise; require removal
of other materials from coal combustion by-products before disposal; confine disposal of coal combustion by-products
to the pit or extraction area from which coal was removed_except that disposal may be allowed in other places within
the permit area if the applicant demonstrates that no adverse environmental impacts will occur; prohibit disposal
of any hazardous component of the coal combustion by-products from being disposed of under the permit; require maps
showing locations and volumes of by-products disposed; require a lab analysis to characterize the coal combustion
by-products; require newspaper advertisements stating that an application proposes disposal of coal combustion
by-products; require an application to demonstrate the legal right to dispose to coal combustion by-products on
the proposed disposal area; require the application to identify the facility that will generate the coal combustion
by-products, a responsible official, components of the by-products, and the coal combustion by-products materials,
weight, and volume; require analysis and a demonstration that each component of the coal combustion by-products
does not contain any contaminant at a concentration that exceeds cabinet regulations; require the application to
include a determination of the probable hydrologic consequences of disposal and measures to minimize disturbances;
require a description of measures to be taken to keep the by-products from becoming airborne; require baseline ground
and surface water data and monitoring wells; require that performance bond required under Chapter 350 cover disposal
of coal combustion by-products when applicable; require the permittee to comply with environmental performance
standards, to include placing the by-products at least four feet above the seasonal high water table unless exempted,
limiting the volume of by-products disposed of on the permit area to the volume of the marketable coal seams to be removed,
limiting the thickness of the disposed by-products to forty feet at any point, and requiring covering the by-products
as contemporaneously as practicable with at least four feet of nonacid-forming spoil material; and require water
quality monitoring and reporting until final bond release.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork

The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is considering a proposal to remove an existing security zone for the St. Johns River, Jacksonville,
Florida, and to establish a security zone for the waters surrounding Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville. The proposed
change will delete an existing security zone for the north bank of the St. Johns River at the junction of Brills Cut Range
and Broward Point Turn, locally known as Dunn Creek Terminal. The proposal is also to establish a security zone around
NAS Jacksonville to safeguard sensitive military assets on the facility. Entry into this zone will be prohibited,
unless authorized by the Captain of the Port.

Discussion of Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule will remove an existing security zone (33 CFR 165.710) located at the junction of Brill's Cut Range
and Broward Point Turn in the St. Johns River. This zone was used to safeguard moored Navy vessels prior to a lease arrangement
with Gate properties for berthing at Blount Island. According to the originators of the security zone request, the
zone is no longer needed for this purpose. The new proposed security zone is to assist the Navy in preventing unauthorized
access to military assets on Naval Air Station Jacksonville. It will also enhance the ability of the Navy to increase
security for their facility during heightened threat conditions. The security zone will border a U.S. Navy level
two restricted area which contains the flightline, naval hospital, and other sensitive military assets. This regulation
is issued pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 191, as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 165.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with section 2.B.2.c of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B and the establishment of security zones has been determined to be categorically excluded
from further environmental documentation.

Economic Assessment and Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations are considered to be non-major under Executive Order 12291 on Federal Regulation and
nonsignificant under the Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034, February
16, 1979). The economic impact of this proposal is expected to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary.
Recreational use of the area will be affected. The security zone will extend for only 400 feet from the shoreline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the impact of this proposal is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, it will not
have significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard proposes to establish a Regulated Navigation Area (RNA) in a portion of Upper New York Bay. Heli-Carriers
International intends to anchor a self-propelled, floating heliport in the waters of Upper New York Bay located in
an area south southwest of Liberty Island and west of Federal Anchorage 20D for the purpose of operating a helicopter
sightseeing service. This regulation is necessary to protect commercial mariners and the recreational boating
public from the hazards associated with establishing a floating helicopter platform and passenger terminal near
an anchorage area.

On February 24, 1994, Heli-Carriers International (herein ``Heli-Carriers'') received official notification
that they were awarded a concession agreement (herein ``the Agreement'') from the State of New Jersey, Department
of Environmental Protection and Energy (herein ``the Department'') to operate a water taxi service that would transport
persons from Liberty State Park, Hudson County, New Jersey, to a helicopter sightseeing service located on the waters
of Upper New York Bay. The execution of the Agreement is dependent upon Heli-Carriers' submittal to the Department
of proof of all license(s), permit(s), and approvals from the State of New Jersey, Federal Government (including
the Federal Aviation Administration), and U.S. Coast Guard. The Agreement is expected to be immediately executed
upon receipt of those submittals and will be effective from the effective date of the Agreement until December 31,
1994, with four (4), one (1) year opportunities for renewal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon execution of the Agreement, Heli-Carrier will operate (1) a water taxi from the boat launch located at the southside
boat dock at Liberty State Park and, (2) a helicopter sightseeing service from a self-propelled, floating heliport
(herein ``heliport'') anchored within a 50 yard radius centered at approximately 40

&rsquo; W longitude in Upper New York Bay. This 50 yard radius is the heliport's anchoring zone. The heliport will be
a Coast Guard inspected, steel-hulled vessel constructed with a helicopter platform.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This heliport will serve as the landing and takeoff platform for helicopters providing aerial tours around New York
harbor and the Statute of Liberty to tourists who visit Liberty State Park. Visitors who are interested in aerial tours
would be transported by Heli-Carriers' water taxi from Liberty State Park to the heliport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heli-Carriers will operate this water taxi and helicopter sightseeing service daily from 10 a.m. to sunset, weather
permitting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to provide for the safe navigation of commercial mariners and the recreational boating public as well as the
safe operation of this helicopter sightseeing service, the Captain of the Port of New York deems a regulated navigation
area to be necessary.

Discussion of Proposed Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard proposes to establish a regulated navigation area in Upper New York Bay for the operations of this helicopter
sightseeing service. The regulated navigation area will prohibit all vessel traffic within defined boundaries
during specified times except for the water taxis operating in conjunction with the heliport. The water taxis serving
the heliport may enter and transit freely within the regulated navigation area at anytime except while a helicopter
is landing on or taking off from the heliport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The area proposed for designation as a regulated navigation area is located in the waters south southwest of Liberty
Island and west of Federal Anchorage 20D in Upper New York Bay. This regulated navigation area will include all waters
within a 150 yard radius measured from a point in the center of the heliport's anchoring zone at or near 40
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;10
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;52
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;N latitude and 074
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;03
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;29
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;W longitude. This 150 yard radius or regulated navigation area is located approximately 650 yards west of
Federal Anchorage 20D and 1,450 yards south of the Statue of Liberty. Two channels, Pierhead and Terminal Channels,
are located approximately 350 yards and 475 yards, respectively, south southwest of the proposed regulated navigation
area. Vessel traffic in these channels consists primarily of tugs and tows. This proposed regulated navigation area
is also in the vicinity of two foul areas; one located to the north and the other located to the east.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard deems this regulated navigation area necessary to ensure the safety of vessel traffic that may desire
to transit the area. The regulated navigation area encompasses the 50 yard radius identified as the heliport's anchoring
zone and an additional 100 yard radius around this anchoring zone. The 100 yard radius is the minimum distance deemed
necessary to protect transiting vessel traffic in the event of an unforeseen mishap aboard or near the heliport. Helicopter
flights are expected to occur frequently throughout each operating day; the exact number of flights will be determined
by customer demand and the length of sightseeing tours chosen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During a helicopter landing or takeoff from the heliport, the water taxis must remain outside a 200 foot radius measured
around the heliport. This 200 foot radius is needed to ensure the safety of the water taxis during landing and takeoff
operations. It allows for the helicopter pilot and heliport operator to concentrate solely on landing and takeoff
operations without the distraction of an approaching vessel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the fact that Heli-Carriers operates both the heliport and the water taxis, safety concerns for the water taxis
are different than they are for other vessel traffic. Operators of the water taxis and the heliport can maintain a level
of communication which will allow for the passing of maneuvering intentions, exchange of schedule and flight pattern
changes, and the passing of any other information that may be necessary to ensure the safety of the water taxi and its
passengers within the regulated navigation area. This level of communication cannot be maintained with other vessel
traffic that may desire to transit the area. Therefore, while the 200 foot radius during the landing and takeoff of
a helicopter is deemed sufficient for the safety of the water taxis, the 150 yard radius identified as the regulated
navigation area is necessary for the safety of all other vessel traffic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Restrictions on vessel movement and operation within this proposed regulated navigation area will be lifted during
those hours that the helicopter sightseeing service is scheduled not to operate. During these hours, daily from sunset
to 10 a.m., commercial and recreational vessels that can safely transit the waters within the regulated navigation
area may do so without restriction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heli-Carriers has indicated that their start up operations will not include aircraft re-fueling operations aboard
the heliport. Heli-Carriers may, however, choose to exercise their option to conduct aircraft re-fueling operations
aboard the heliport sometime in the future. Should Heli-Carriers opt to conduct re-fueling operations within this
regulated navigation area, the Coast Guard will reevaluate their operations and the sufficiency of this regulated
navigation area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this regulated navigation area relieves Heli-Carriers from complying with all Federal, State, and local
regulations that pertain to this heliport operation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Establishment of this regulated navigation area will not endanger commercial traffic. No navigable channel in the
vicinity of this regulated navigation area will be affected. Vessel traffic will find it necessary to transit around
this regulated navigation area when going to and from Liberty State Park, New Jersey, in a southerly direction. The
vessel traffic that transits this area consists primarily of commercial dinner cruise boats in the early evening
hours and a number of small fishing crafts throughout the day. However, there are ample waters which will allow vessel
traffic to safely transit around this regulated navigation area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the effective period of this regulation is scheduled to terminate concurrently with the Agreement on December
31, 1994, it may be amended to remain in effect during subsequent Agreement renewals.

Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations are not significant under Executive Order 12866 and not significant under Department of Transportation
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). Due to the fact that the proposed regulated navigation
area is not known to be heavily used by commercial or recreational traffic and that there are sufficient waters to allow
vessel traffic to safely maneuver around this area, the Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation
to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.

have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For reasons given in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal.
The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of these regulations and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to promote maritime
safety and protect the environment, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination will be included in the docket.

A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required under title V of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (``the Act''), EPA has promulgated rules which define
the minimum elements of an approvable State operating permits program and the corresponding standards and procedures
by which the EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of a State operating permits program (see 57 FR 32250
(July 21, 1992)). These rules are codified at title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70. Title V requires
States to develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing these operating permits to all major stationary sources
and to certain other sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve
or disapprove each program within one year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs pursuant
to section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval.
Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim
approval for a period of up to two years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by two years after the November 15, 1993,
date, or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program.

1. Support Materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 502(d) of the Clean Air Act as amended (1990 Amendments), the Governor of each State must develop
and submit to the Administrator an operating permits program under State or local law or under an interstate compact
meeting the requirements of title V of the Act. NMED requested, under the signature of Governor Bruce King, approval
with full authority to administer the State operating permits program submittal, prepared by NMED, in all areas of
the State of New Mexico with the exceptions of Bernalillo County and Indian Lands. The title V operating permits program
package for Bernalillo County will be submitted separately by the City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department,
and it will be addressed in a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 action. Bernalillo County is granted the authority to administer a local air pollution control program by the New
Mexico Air Quality Control Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NMED operating permits program submittal, New Mexico does not assert jurisdiction over Indian lands or reservations
for purposes of 40 CFR part 70 and title V. EPA will, at a future date, conduct a Federal title V operating permits program
governing title V sources of air emissions on Indian lands and reservations in New Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To date, no tribal or Pueblo government in New Mexico has authority to administer an independent air program in the
State. Upon promulgation of the Indian air regulations, the Indians will then be able to apply as a State, and receive
the authority from EPA, to implement an operating permits program under title V of the 1990 Amendments. The Navajo
Nation lands, including those in New Mexico, are administered under the jurisdiction of EPA Region 9. The State of
New Mexico recognizes the five (5) reservations and nineteen (19) Pueblos throughout the lands of the State. A map
outlining and listing each tribe by name is attached to the Governor's letter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The New Mexico submittal, provided as Item II&hyph;''Operating Permits Program Description,'' addresses 40 CFR
70.4(b)(1) by describing how NMED intends to carry out its responsibilities under the part 70 regulations. The program
description addresses the following areas: (A) Organizational structure; (B) Regulations, guidelines, policies,
and procedures; and (C) Future regulatory actions (40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(i) and (v)). The program description has been
deemed to be appropriate for meeting the requirement of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3), the Governor is required to submit a legal opinion from the attorney general (or the
attorney for the State air pollution control agency that has independent legal counsel) demonstrating adequate
authority to carry out all aspects of a title V operating permits program. The State of New Mexico submitted an Attorney
General's Opinion and a Supplemental Attorney General's Opinion demonstrating adequate legal authority as required
by Federal law and regulation except with regard to criminal fine authority. The Attorney General's Opinion acknowledged
that a statutory revision would be required to bring its criminal fine authority into precise conformance with the
requirements of 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State statutes cited in the Attorney General's Opinion authorize the imposition of criminal fines in the amounts
of only $1,000 and $5,000 for misdemeanor and felony violations, respectively, rather than the $10,000 per violation
amounts required by 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(ii) for knowing violations of applicable requirements, permit conditions
and fee and filing requirements. Further, those statutes do not appear to authorize the fine amounts to be imposed
per day per violation as required by 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(ii). Although these defects in criminal fine authority preclude
EPA from granting full approval of the State's operating permits program at this time, EPA may grant interim approval,
subject to the State obtaining the needed criminal fine authority within 18 months after the Administrator's approval
of the New Mexico title V program pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4(f)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State's Supplemental Attorney General's Opinion addresses the criminal fine authority required by 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(iii)
for tampering and false statement. EPA is relying on the State's interpretation of its statute, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMSA 1978 section 74&hyph;2&hyph;14.E., as demonstrating that New Mexico law allows criminal fines of at least $10,000
per day for each act of tampering and for each false statement as required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(iii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(i) requires that the State demonstrate adequate legal authority to issue permits and assure compliance
with each applicable requirement of 40 CFR part 70. New Mexico regulation, AQCR 770.III.C.1.d., states that ``The
department may impose conditions regulating emissions during start-up and shutdown.'' EPA is relying on the State's
interpretation of this language, discussed in the State's Supplemental Attorney General's Opinion, as allowing
the department to impose requirements which exceed title V applicable requirements, but not to waive any title V requirements
for title V sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.4(b)(4) requires the submission of relevant permitting program documentation not contained in the regulations,
such as permit forms and relevant guidance to assist in the State's implementation of its permit program. The State
addresses this requirement in its program submittal under Item II&hyph;''Program Description'' and Item V&hyph;''Program
Documentation.''

2. Regulations and Program Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of New Mexico has submitted Air Quality Control Regulations (AQCR) 770&hyph;''Operating Permit Regulations''
and AQCR 771&hyph;''Fee Regulations,'' for implementing the State part 70 program as required by 40 CFR 70.4(b)(2).
Sufficient evidence of their procedurally correct adoption was submitted in a supplemental submittal on January
11, 1994, supplementing the evidence of adoption which was sent to EPA in the State's original submittal. Copies of
all applicable State and local statutes and regulations which authorize the part 70 program, including those governing
State administrative procedures, were submitted with the State's program. The State also submitted a list of insignificant
activities with the submittal for EPA to propose approving with the approval of the State operating permits program.
This list which has been through the public participation process during the operating permits regulation hearing
was addressed by the Regional office with no comment. The list can be found in the submittal under Item II&hyph;''Operating
Permits Program Description,'' Attachment II&hyph;3&hyph;''List of Insignificant Activities.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The New Mexico operating permits regulations followed part 70 very closely with a few exceptions. The cross-reference
chart can be found in the New Mexico submittal under Item VI&hyph;''Various Provisions,'' Attachment VI&hyph;1,
indicating where each paragraph of the part 70 regulation is addressed in AQCR 770. AQCR 770 is submitted as Attachment
III&hyph;1. The following requirements, set out in EPA's part 70 operating permits program review, are addressed
in Item VI of the State's submittal: (A) Applicability criteria, including any criteria used to determine insignificant

3. Permit Fee Demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In AQCR 771, the State's fee regulation, New Mexico established fees for criteria air pollutants which are below the
presumptive minimum. The New Mexico regulation allows for a fee of $10.25 per ton for criteria pollutants based on
allowable emissions at major sources as defined in AQCR 770&hyph;''Operating Permits'' regulations. For facilities
which are only major for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) and not for other pollutants, the fees are $150 per ton for the
189 HAPs listed in title III of the 1990 Amendments. These fees, when converted using EPA criteria, result in the collection
of an average of $19.30 per ton for title V sources. The State of New Mexico, after careful review, determined that these
fees would support the title V permit program costs as required by 40 CFR 70.9(a). New Mexico explains in its fee demonstration
that it chose this fee structure because it allowed for program costs to be covered without unduly penalizing any industry
in the State, and the fees generated would meet, but not likely exceed, program costs. The NMED will have a periodic
review of the program fee schedule. The New Mexico fee demonstration shows that this fee schedule meets the requirements
for an operating permits program in New Mexico. The State will collect 2.7 million dollars per year to support all applicable
part 70 activities. The State projects the direct cost to fund the operation of the title V program to be 2.3 million
dollars per year, and the indirect cost to be approximately $372,000. The State anticipates increasing its air quality
staff by 38 new full time employees (FTE), a total of 1/3 of the existing air program staff. Any changes in the fees would
need to be made by NMED through the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board.

4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of New Mexico acknowledges that its request for approval of a part 70 program is also a request for approval
of a program for delegation of section 112 standards as they apply to part 70 sources. The State of New Mexico currently
receives delegation of any new provisions required by section 112 of the Act (governing National Emission Standards
for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP)) on an annual basis through a delegation agreement with EPA. Under the 1990
Amendments, the State can now receive delegation of any new authority required by section 112 of the Act through approval
of the State operating permits program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has the option at any time to request, under section 112(l) of the Act, delegation of section 112 requirements
in the form of State regulations which the State demonstrates are equivalent to the corresponding section 112 provisions
promulgated by EPA. At this time, the State plans to use the mechanism of incorporation by reference to adopt unchanged
Federal section 112 requirements into its regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The radionuclide NESHAP is a section 112 regulation and therefore, also an applicable requirement under the State
operating permits program. The EPA will work with the State in the development of its radionuclide program to ensure
that permits are issued in a timely manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 112(g) of the Act requires that, after the effective date of a permits program under title V, no person may construct
or reconstruct any major source of any HAPs unless the State determines that the maximum achievable control technology
emission limitation under section 112(g) for new sources will be met. Such determination must be made on a case-by-case
basis where no applicable limitations have been established by the Administrator. After the title V effective date
and before the promulgation of the Federal 112(g) rule, New Mexico intends to implement section 112(g) of the Act with
regard to new sources through the State's preconstruction process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of New Mexico commits to appropriately implementing the existing and future requirements of sections 111,
112 and 129 of the Act, and all maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards promulgated in the future,
in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of New Mexico commits to having an acid rain program in place by January 1, 1995. The State will submit copies
to EPA of any proposed program rules, regulations and guidance prepared for review and comment to meet the Federal
implementation date and to issue permits by December 1997.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NMED's operating permits program submittal addressed the enforcement requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(4)(ii)
and 70.4(b)(5) in Item VIII&hyph;''Enforcement Provisions.'' In a supplemental submittal, received by EPA after
the November 15, 1993 submittal, the Regional Office received a signed Memorandum of Understanding between EPA Region
6 and NMED. This document, which was the product of negotiations between EPA Region 6 and NMED, had been awaiting signature
at the time of the original submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Item VIII of the State's submittal addresses the following issues: (A) Compliance Tracking and Enforcement Plan

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(40 CFR 70.4(b)(4)(ii) and 70.4(b)(5)); (B) Commitment to Submit Enforcement Information (40 CFR 70.4(b)(9));

7. Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of New Mexico submitted to EPA, under a cover letter from the Governor dated November 15, 1993, the State's
operating permits program. The submittal has adequately addressed all sixteen (16) elements required for full approval
as discussed in part 70, except with regard to criminal fine authority. The State of New Mexico addressed appropriately
all requirements necessary to receive interim approval of the State operating permits program pursuant to title
V, 1990 Amendments and 40 CFR part 70. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Options for Approval/Disapproval and Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval of the operating permits program submitted by New Mexico on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 15, 1993. Interim approvals under section 502(g) of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. If promulgated, the State must make the following changes
to receive full approval: Correct the statutory defect in criminal fine authority. In addition to raising the criminal
fine amounts to at least $10,000 for all offenses listed in 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(ii), statutory revisions must provide
authority for the imposition of those fines on a per day per violation basis, as required by 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(ii).
Evidence of these statutory revisions and their procedurally correct adoption must be submitted to EPA within 18
months of EPA's approval of the New Mexico operating permits program. This interim approval, which may not be renewed,
extends for a period of up to two years. During the interim approval period, the State is protected from sanctions for
failure to have a program, and EPA is not obligated to promulgate a Federal permit program in the State. Permits issued
under a program with interim approval have full standing with respect to part 70, and the one year time period for submittal
of permit applications by subject sources begins upon interim approval, as does the three year time period for processing
the initial permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If this proposed interim approval is converted to a disapproval, it will not affect any existing State requirements
applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval of the State submittal would not affect its State-enforceability.
Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal would not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies
that such a disapproval action would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because
it would not remove existing State requirements or substitute a new Federal requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Proposed Rulemaking Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this action, EPA is proposing interim approval of the operating permits program submitted by the State of New Mexico.
The program was submitted by the State to EPA for the purpose of complying with Federal requirements found in title
V of the 1990 Amendments, and in 40 CFR part 70, which mandate that States develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing
operating permits to all major stationary sources, and to certain other sources with the exceptions of Bernalillo
County and Indian Lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements for title V approval, specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) requirements for approval of a program for delegation of Federal section
112 standards as they apply to part 70 sources. Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate
authorities, adequate resources for implementation, and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements
under part 70. Therefore, as part of this interim approval, the EPA is also proposing to grant approval under section
112(l)(5) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 63.91 of the State's program for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from Federal
standards as promulgated. This applies to existing and future standards as they apply to sources covered by the part
70 program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed this submittal of the New Mexico operating permits program and is proposing interim approval. Certain
defects in the State's statutory criminal fine authority preclude EPA from granting full approval of the State's
operating permits program at this time. EPA is proposing to grant interim approval, subject to the State obtaining
the needed criminal fine authority within 18 months after the Administrator's approval of the New Mexico title V program
pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4.

A. Request for Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposed rule. Copies of the State's submittal and other information
relied upon for the proposed interim approval are contained in a docket maintained at the EPA Regional Office. The
docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to, or otherwise considered by, EPA in the
development of this proposed rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are:

(1) To allow interested parties a means to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate
in the rulemaking process; and

B. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a rule
that may:Q02
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affect a sector of the economy,
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments
or communities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.

D. Regulatory Flexibility Act

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating permits program approvals under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal operating permits program approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids EPA
to base its actions concerning operating permits programs on such grounds (

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is today withdrawing a proposed rule (57 FR 52716, November 4, 1992) that
would have revised the Clean Water Act Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines to provide an exception from the wetlands mitigation
sequence for proposed discharges of dredged or fill material into wetlands in the State of Alaska. Under the proposed
rule, discharges of dredged or fill material into wetlands in Alaska would have been excepted from current requirements
that all proposed discharges represent the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative and that all
practicable measures to compensate for unavoidable adverse impacts on the aquatic ecosystem be undertaken. After
consideration of public comments, EPA has determined that it is appropriate to withdraw this proposed rule based
on concerns that the rule would result in avoidable and unmitigated adverse impacts to Alaska's wetlands.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (renamed in 1977 as the Clean Water Act) established, in section 404,
a regulatory program for the evaluation of permit applications for proposed discharges of dredged or fill material
into waters of the United States, including wetlands. Section 404(a) authorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting
through the Chief of Engineers, to issue permits specifying disposal sites in waters of the U.S. in accordance with
regulatory requirements of the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (Guidelines). The Guidelines, which were published
as final regulations on December 24, 1980 (45 FR 85336), are the substantive environmental criteria used in evaluating
discharges of dredged or fill material under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Guidelines provide four general restrictions in &sect;230.10 that must be met before a permit can be issued authorizing
the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. The proposed rulemaking focused on two of these restrictions:
the prohibition in &sect;230.10(a) of any discharge where there is a less damaging practicable alternative and the
requirement in &sect;230.10(d) that all appropriate and practicable steps be taken to minimize potential harm to
the aquatic ecosystem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mitigation process is designed to establish a consistent approach to be used in ensuring that all practicable
measures have been taken to reduce potential adverse impacts associated with proposed projects in wetlands and other
aquatic systems. The first step in the sequence requires the evaluation of potential alternative sites to locate
the proposed project so that aquatic impacts are avoided to the maximum extent practicable. As the next step in the
sequence, remaining impacts are minimized, by making changes in project design or construction methods that reduce
overall project impacts. Lastly, after all practicable steps have been taken to avoid and minimize potential adverse
effects, compensation for remaining unavoidable impacts is sought by such measures as wetlands creation or restoration
in order to replace lost aquatic functions and values. The result is prevention of wetlands impacts where practicable;
but where the actions necessary to prevent such impacts are not available and capable of being done, associated losses
of wetland and aquatic functions and values are offset to the extent appropriate and practicable with compensatory
mitigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 9, 1991, the Bush Administration issued a plan for protecting wetlands that contained provisions to ``improve
and streamline the current regulatory system.'' One element of the plan provided that ``States with less than a 1 percent
historic rate of wetlands development will be able to satisfy permit requirements through minimization.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on historic loss data (Dahl, T.E., 1990. ``Wetlands Losses in the United States 1780's to 1980's'' U.S. Department
of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC, 21 pp.), this provision was applicable only in the State
of Alaska. According to this data, approximately 0.1 percent of the State's original wetland acreage has been lost.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 4, 1992, the EPA published a proposed rule (57 FR 52716) to implement that element of the August 9, 1991,
plan. The proposed rule provided that proposed discharges of dredged or fill material into wetlands in the State of
Alaska would be excepted from current provisions of the Guidelines that require that all proposed discharges of dredged
or fill material represent the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative. In addition, the proposed
rule provided that, for proposed discharges of dredged or fill material into wetlands in the State of Alaska, the requirement
that all appropriate and practicable measures to compensate for potential unavoidable adverse impacts on the aquatic
ecosystem would no longer be applicable. For the State of Alaska, minimization of impacts would have constituted
the requisite mitigation necessary to meet the mitigation requirements of the Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble to the proposed rule solicited comment on whether or not it would be appropriate for the rule to more directly
address the protection of high-value wetlands, including the option of maintaining the full sequence of avoidance,
minimization, and compensation for high-value wetlands, and if appropriate, how this might be accomplished. The
preamble made specific reference to ongoing efforts by the State of Alaska to develop a wetlands categorization approach
as part of a State regulatory approach for freshwater wetlands that may prove useful for the identification and protection
of high-value wetlands. Comment was specifically invited on how Alaska's wetlands regulatory approach might be
integrated into a final rule, and how Federal agencies might most appropriately apply Alaska's system for identifying
high-value wetlands. The close of the 45-day public comment period was December 21, 1992.

Public Comments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received over 6,600 public comments in response to the November 4, 1992, notice of proposed rulemaking. Of those
comments, 10% were received from persons in Alaska, while the remaining 90% were received from persons in States other
than Alaska. Specific issues areas addressed in the public comments received included the feasibility of practicable
alternatives and compensatory mitigation, the existing degree of section 404 regulatory flexibility, protection
of high-value wetlands, and Alaska's wetland regulatory approach under development. A summary of the significant
relevant comments, and EPA's assessment of them, is provided below.

Practicable Alternatives and Compensatory Mitigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would have eliminated for Alaska the requirements to avoid wetlands losses and to compensate for
unavoidable wetlands impacts where practicable. Comments regarding practicable alternatives and compensatory
mitigation primarily consisted of statements and examples regarding their feasibility. The great majority of comments
asserted that, in general, in Alaska there are no practicable alternatives to developing in wetlands and that, in
general, compensatory mitigation is not practicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments, although agreeing with those who commented that alternatives and compensatory mitigation
are not practicable in Alaska, did not believe that these conditions warranted eliminating avoidance and compensatory
mitigation from existing requirements, particularly because these requirements are only pursued when ``practicable.''
Most of these comments pointed out that these determinations are made on a site-specific basis, which allows great
flexibility in the degree to which avoidance and compensatory mitigation are pursued. A few comments recommended
other ways of addressing these mitigation sequence requirements, particularly ways in which compensatory mitigation
could be achieved without creation of wetlands from uplands.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many comments indicated that the agency's proposed justification for eliminating the consideration of alternatives
was improperly based on an assumption concerning the limited availability of upland alternatives. These comments
stated that the consideration of practicable alternatives is site-specific, and therefore a categorical exemption,
especially for an area the size of Alaska, cannot be made. Several comments cited examples of where practicable alternatives
to discharging dredged or fill material into wetlands exist in Alaska or publications that stated that such alternatives
exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments indicated that there are opportunities for compensatory mitigation in Alaska. One comment stated
that the low wetlands loss rate does not make it exceptionally difficult to restore historic wetlands and that the
hydrology of the State does not make restoration any more difficult in Alaska than in other States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments stated that because compensatory mitigation may include enhancement activities, it should not be
ruled out merely because there may be limited sites available for creation and restoration. One comment cited a project
conducted by Ducks Unlimited and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in which ponds were apparently created in muskeg
wetlands to increase the value to waterfowl nesting. Another comment stated that existing literature shows many
``arctic specific'' methods available to enhance certain tundra habitat and that there are a number of ``success
stories'' for enhancement on the North Slope.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing these comments, EPA has concluded that the proposed rule, by allowing discharges of dredged or fill
material into wetlands without any analysis of whether less damaging, practicable alternatives were available
or without requiring any compensatory mitigation, regardless of its practicability, would have resulted in adverse
impacts to wetlands in Alaska. EPA has concluded that existing mitigation requirements to avoid wetlands losses
and to compensate for unavoidable impacts where practicable are sufficiently flexible to consider the fact that
avoidance and compensatory mitigation may not be feasible in certain cases. EPA believes that the definition of ``practicable''
affords discretion and flexibility to the Corps to craft case-specific decisions that effectively consider highly
diverse environmental, economic, and geographical conditions, including those found in Alaska. Therefore EPA
believes that the proposed rule's categorical elimination of the avoidance and compensatory mitigation requirements
for discharges in Alaska is not warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA/Army Mitigation MOA, which clarifies the Guidelines mitigation requirements, recognizes that avoidance
and compensatory mitigation might not occur on every proposed permit action. The MOA contains qualifying language
that states that avoidance and compensatory mitigation may not be practicable in areas where wetlands are abundant.
Moreover, in January 1992, EPA and Army issued a clarification to the Guidelines and the MOA with respect to Alaska
which emphasizes that ``[w]here there is a high proportion of land in a watershed or region which is wetlands, it is
likely that avoiding impacts to wetlands will not be practicable depending on project size and other logistical considerations,''
and ``that there are areas, including many locations in Alaska, where it may not be practicable to restore or create
wetlands; in such cases compensatory mitigation is not required under the Guidelines.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the record of the Section 404 program in Alaska relative to requiring mitigation demonstrates the
flexibility of the regulations to reflect the circumstances of the State. This flexibility has resulted in the requirement
of compensatory mitigation in only approximately 4% of all individual permit approvals in Alaska. In Fiscal Year
1993, the Alaska District Corps authorized the filling of 1,092 acres of wetlands while only 226 acres of compensatory
mitigation were required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Existing Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A large number of comments addressed the issue of whether existing regulations, beyond the specific issues of practicable
alternatives and compensatory mitigation, are sufficiently flexible to allow appropriate development in Alaska,
while ensuring necessary resource protection. Roughly half of those comments asserted that existing regulations
are flexible enough, while the other half asserted that they are not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments stated that wetlands regulations are cumbersome and do not recognize the extent of low and moderate
value wetlands in Alaska. Some also stated that wetlands regulations hinder development. Other comments cited Corps
Alaska District permit statistics to support assertions that the regulatory program is already flexible enough_or
``too flexible'' according to some comments_to accommodate permit applicants. Many comments argued that wetlands
regulations are no more burdensome in Alaska than in any other State. Another comment noted that Alaska, as one of the
fifty States, should be bound by the same laws and regulations as everyone else. Other comments added that in addition
to the low denial rates for individual permits, the existence of general permits for a variety of activities demonstrates
additional regulatory flexibility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has concluded that a reasonable amount of flexibility exists in the Section 404 regulatory program to protect
wetlands in Alaska from adverse impacts, while allowing wetlands development in appropriate circumstances. The
flexibility of the Section 404 regulatory program is evident in the review process for individual permits, the application
of general permits and other authorizing mechanisms, and the statistical record of the permit program in Alaska.
Consequently, EPA has concluded that the additional ``flexibility'' offered by the proposed rule, i.e., eliminating
the avoidance and compensatory mitigation requirements, is overly broad and unwarranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing flexibility in the section 404 permitting program is reflected in permitting statistics. First, it
is important to note that the section 404 regulatory program does not prohibit development in wetlands or other waters
of the U.S. In the U.S., as many as 60,000 discharges per year are authorized under the section 404 program. Well over
80% of all actions subject to section 404 are authorized by the Corps via general permits, which authorize categories
of activities to proceed without an individual permit application. General permits efficiently allow actions with
minimal impacts to proceed with little if any administrative burden, while allowing regulators and others to concentrate
attention on activities with the potential for significant impacts. At present, there are 36 nationwide general
permits that authorize such activities as placement of outfall structures, road crossings, utility line backfill,
boat ramps, farm buildings, and minor discharges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Alaska, roughly 900 discharges are authorized annually under Section 404. On average, general permits account
for over 70% of these authorized actions. In addition to the nationwide general permits, the Alaska District currently
has 21 regional general permits in effect in the State, four of which apply Statewide. Response times for general permits
that require action by the Corps average 11 days in Alaska. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those activities that require individual permits, the Alaska District's denial rate for individual permits
is only four percent. Although about 35% of these applications may be withdrawn by the applicant, in most cases, withdrawals
of individual permits are not tantamount to denial. For example, a number of withdrawn actions are due to reduction
of project impacts to the point that a general permit is applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permit decisions are generally made within 60&hyph;90 days from the date an application is complete. However, larger
or controversial projects may take 120 days or more to evaluate. More lengthy permit reviews generally occur in instances
when the project site is located in an environmentally sensitive area such as high value wetlands, where there is strong
opposition from the public or local governments, or it is determined that an Environmental Impact Statement is necessary.
During fiscal year 1993, the Alaska District completed its evaluations of individual permit applications in an average
time of 106 days. However, the average evaluation time for all permit actions, including general permits, was 37 days.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Corps Alaska District has worked with the State of Alaska to coordinate the timing of the State and Federal review
of proposed permit actions. The State's coastal zone questionnaire is included with all Corps application packages;
the Corps and the State share the lead for setting up pre-application coordination meetings with interested State
and Federal resource agencies; the State has agreed to accept the Corps application as application for State 401 Water
Quality Certification whenever the Corps determines the activity could result in a discharge to waters of the U.S.;
the District includes State public notices with its public notice and handles State legal notices (but not payment)
for the activity; the District mails an advance copy of complete applications to the State 401 and Coastal Zone Management
(CZM) agencies prior to going to public notice; the District notifies the CZM offices of all actions advertised the
previous week; and the State has agreed to accept the District's determination for minor permit modifications subject
to expedited review (the State may reverse this determination and require a full State review whenever they determine
this to be appropriate). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding other authorizing mechanisms, the Corps District Engineers uses general permits and alternative permit
processing procedures such as letters of permission, regional general permits, and joint procedures. It is intended
that these alternative procedures be used in instances where there are minimal impacts and/or adequate environmental
safeguards in order to: (1) Reduce delay and/or (2) avoid duplication of efforts where other agencies have ongoing
permit programs for activities also regulated by the Corps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that the Corps is presently developing two rulemakings to further address the concerns of timeliness
and accuracy of permit decisions. The first proposal would generally require the Corps to reach a permit decision
in a maximum of 90 days. The second proposal would establish an administrative appeals process for jurisdictional
determinations, permit denials, and administrative penalties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
High-value Wetlands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule contained an exception from avoiding or compensating for the loss of wetlands that would have applied
to all wetlands in Alaska. No distinction was made between wetlands that exhibit greater or fewer functions and values.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More comments were received regarding the uniqueness and value of Alaska's wetlands, and the need for protection
of high-value ones, than on any other issue. A few comments recommended ways of incorporating consideration of high-value
wetlands into the rule. Many comments addressed functions and values of Alaska's wetlands, including particular
examples of high-value wetland functions or particular wetlands in Alaska that exemplified certain high-values.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A majority of comments on the issue indicated that, if issued, a final rule should specifically address the need for
protecting high-value wetlands. To this end, a number of comments cited the potential loss of all 345,000 acres of
estuarine intertidal vegetated wetlands, which play a significant role in maintaining, among other things, much
of Alaska's fishing industry. Several comments noted that conflicts between development and wetlands are highest
in coastal areas, where building demands and valuable habitat coincide. Several comments also questioned to what
extent EPA considered the potential adverse cumulative impacts of the proposed rule on wetlands-dependent hydrologic
functions and wildlife. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, other comments stated that the proposed rule should not expressly provide a separate level of protection
for high-value wetlands. Some comments asserted that the lack of clear criteria for distinguishing high-value wetlands
from low-value wetlands was a good reason not to restrict application of the rule to certain wetlands in Alaska and
argued that attempts to apply certain requirements only to ``high-value'' wetlands would likely be a difficult,
expensive, and time-consuming process. Other comments stated that almost all the State's high-value wetlands are
already protected in conservation units. Others stated that high-value wetlands would still be protected through
State and local permitting and land use management programs. The State of Alaska reiterated its commitment to identify
and protect all of its high-value wetlands through coastal zone management, State freshwater wetlands pollution
control, and other regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, the requirement to avoid or compensate for impacts to wetlands in Alaska would be removed,
thereby requiring only minimization of impacts to wetlands, including high-value ones. Of those comments specifically
addressing the mitigation sequence, most favored the option of maintaining the full sequence of avoidance, minimization,
and compensation for high-value wetlands. One comment stated a preference for protecting high-value wetlands,
but allowing the development of low-value wetlands where unavoidable and with no compensatory mitigation required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address the issue of how to consider high-value wetlands, comments suggested a variety of classification schemes.
One approach recommended applying the rule on an ``ecoregion'' scale (e.g., the North Slope), as opposed to the entire
State. One comment elaborated that it would be fair to ``relax'' mitigation sequence requirements for areas like
the North Slope, but not for areas with less abundant wetland types. Others suggested evaluating the one percent wetlands
loss on a watershed basis, including one comment that asserted that the exception for the entire state of Alaska was
inappropriate since the importance of the biological values and hydrologic functions of individual wetlands is
realized on a much smaller scale, and that boundaries should be based on hydrologic and/or biological criteria.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another approach recommended general permits for discharges into specific types of wetlands_black spruce bog,
heath tundra, and alpine tundra_with size and slope restrictions. One comment further suggested retaining the avoidance
requirement, but not acre-for-acre compensation, for wet sedge tundra, riverine, lacustrine, and palustrine emergent
wetlands; however, coastal and other wetlands would be accorded the full mitigation sequence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments listed characteristics or criteria of what respondents indicated help define high-value wetlands.
These comments focused primarily on the habitat values that certain wetlands provide for wildlife and fisheries,
as well as a number of non-habitat functional characteristics. In addition to wildlife habitat characteristics,
comments listed as valuable, wetlands that supported sport, commercial, and subsistence fisheries for native and
rural non-native Alaskans, as well as tourism, hunting, and bird watching. Also included were wetlands performing
hydrologic functions such as retention of sediments, nutrients, and toxicants or moderation of surface runoff.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing these comments, EPA has concluded that the proposed rule would have resulted in adverse impacts to
wetlands, including those of high value. We were particularly concerned about the impact the proposed rule would
have had on coastal wetlands in the State. According to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), substantial
marine wetlands, which are of particularly great value, have already been lost in Alaska. NMFS noted that coastal
wetlands ``are critical to *&blank;*&blank;* Alaska's salmon and other valuable species *&blank;*&blank;*''
and that ``disproportionately high development pressures historically have been focused on this small but critical
percentage.'' EPA also agreed with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) concern that the proposed rule would
hinder management efforts for several federally listed or proposed threatened and endangered species that utilize
Alaska's wetlands, as well as hasten the listing of additional candidate species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, EPA has concluded that modifying the rule so that it did not apply to high-value wetlands was not practicable.
At this time there is no scientifically defensible method to categorize wetlands by value on an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a priori 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
basis for an area as large as the State of Alaska. However, we realize that categorization on a case-by-case basis may
be practicable, and that the Section 404 regulatory program has appropriate regulatory mechanisms to address such
cases where determination of alternatives and compensatory mitigation are either not required or their evaluation
is limited. For example, general permits allow actions with minimal impacts to proceed with little or no administrative
requirements, most with no requirement for analyzing alternatives or performing compensatory mitigation. Fully
two-thirds of all Section 404 activities in Alaska are conducted under general permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Section 404 regulatory program already allows flexibility in how requirements for analysis of alternatives
and compensatory mitigation are achieved. EPA and the Corps issued Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines Flexibility Guidance
to field staff to clarify and standardize the flexibility afforded in the Guidelines regarding the analysis of project
alternatives, based on the severity of environmental impacts of the proposed discharge. That guidance recognizes
that all wetlands are not of equal value and clarifies that small projects with minor impacts are subject to less rigorous
permit review than for larger ones with potentially greater impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, planning mechanisms such as watershed plans, advance identification, special area management plans,
and State coastal zone management plans, provide the opportunity to incorporate consideration of the mitigation
sequence. The mitigation sequence is considered satisfied when proposed mitigation is in accordance with specific
provisions of a Corps-EPA approved comprehensive plan that ensures compliance with the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines.
Such plans can result in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a priori
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decisions on the suitability of development in specific areas and the issuance of general permits in others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, as discussed above, not only do existing regulations allow a Section 404 permit applicant to have the avoidance
and/or the compensatory mitigation components of the mitigation sequence considered satisfied where these requirements
are not practicable, but this flexibility is being implemented in the State of Alaska.

Alaska's Wetland Regulatory Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1992, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation received a grant from EPA to develop a Statewide wetlands
management and conservation strategy. The principal objective of this study is to develop a hydrogeomorphic wetlands
classification methodology specifically applicable to Alaska's wetlands. This functional assessment, combined
with local experience and expert knowledge, is intended eventually to evaluate and rank Alaska's wetlands according
to their value and to develop corresponding regulatory responses.

A number of comments on the proposed rule addressed Alaska's wetland regulatory approach and its relation to identifying
and protecting high-value wetlands. A majority of comments indicated that the regulatory approach should not be
integrated into a final rule, most citing that they did not want issuance of the final rule delayed until the State effort
could be completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments provided a different perspective. One comment indicated that the State's approach is unworkable
and that the hydrogeomorphic data required in the approach is lacking for most areas and will be expensive to obtain.
Another comment stated that a final rule should directly address the protection of high-value wetlands as identified
in the State effort and through designation by the USFWS, although no recommendation was made as to how this might be
accomplished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA supports the State of Alaska in their effort to develop a Statewide wetlands management and conservation strategy,
including development of methodologies to evaluate and document wetlands functions and values. However, EPA has
concluded that the infeasibility of conducting

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
wetlands categorization for the entire State, coupled with the status of the State approach, means that the State's
efforts could not be used to formulate an environmentally acceptable final rule. However, EPA anticipates that,
when completed, the management and conservation strategy will serve as a key resource in measuring wetlands values
for permit decisions in the State.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 24, 1993, the Clinton Administration issued a plan for protecting America's wetlands that consists of a
comprehensive package of regulatory improvements and non-regulatory policies. The package supports: the interim
goal of no overall net loss of the Nation's remaining wetlands; an efficient, fair, flexible, and predictable regulatory
program; non-regulatory programs such as advance planning, wetlands restoration, and public-private cooperative
efforts; partnerships with State, Tribal, and local governments; and policies based upon the best scientific information
available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of more than forty actions and recommendations applicable nationally, many of which are of value in improving or clarifying
wetlands efforts in Alaska, the Administration plan contains two provisions pertaining exclusively to the State.
The Administration announced that the proposed rule would be withdrawn. However, recognizing the need to address
Alaska-specific concerns in a fair, flexible, and efficient manner, the Administration plan committed EPA and the
Corps to meet with Federal resource agencies, State and local governments, representatives of Native villages,
industry groups including oil and fishing interests, and environmental groups to consider other environmentally
appropriate means to assure regulatory flexibility and the feasibility of alternative permitting procedures in
Alaska.

On October 12, 1993, the Federal agencies in Alaska announced the Alaska Wetlands Initiative and invited a diverse
and comprehensive group of stakeholders to participate in a series of independently facilitated meetings in Juneau,
Bethel, Fairbanks, and Anchorage in late October and early November. The two-day meetings offered the opportunity
for stakeholders to make uninterrupted presentations, as well as to discuss concerns in a roundtable format. In addition,
the public was invited to attend these meetings, make an oral statement at the close of each, to submit written comments,
and to participate in a Statewide teleconference linking 20 locations throughout Alaska. Furthermore, approximately
1,500 letters were mailed to Alaskans who over the last several years had applied for Section 404 permits, to survey
their opinion of their experience with the regulatory program. The number and variety of opportunities for public
comment were provided to ensure that the process would consider the individual opinions of Alaskans who wished to
express themselves independent of a particular stakeholder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the meetings and public comments received, a series of 11 draft issue papers for public review was developed
by EPA and the Corps, in conjunction with USFWS and NMFS. Each draft issue paper included a general background discussion
of that issue, a summary of the stakeholder and public comments received, an analysis, and a set of proposed recommendations
for discussion. This series of draft issue papers, which was distributed on December 17, 1993, served as the focus
of discussion at a final set of stakeholder meetings that was convened in January 1994. At that time the Corps and EPA
sought further, more focussed input from the stakeholders on how well the draft issue papers characterized their
concerns and how well the proposed recommendations for discussion responded to those concerns. The public was again
invited to these meetings, provided with an open microphone opportunity at the conclusion of each meeting, and encouraged
to comment in writing on the draft issue papers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA concludes, consistent with the Administration Wetlands Plan and as detailed in the response to comments above,
that the proposed rule would result in avoidable and unmitigated adverse impacts to wetlands in Alaska. Existing
flexibility in applying the requirements of the Section 404 regulatory program in combination with actions being
implemented as a result of the Administration's Wetlands Plan are effective in addressing Alaskan concerns with
the Section 404 program and the State's climatological and physiographic circumstances. Furthermore, the Alaskan
stakeholders and public who participated in the Alaska Wetlands Initiative have helped to define these specific
concerns and to recommend ways of addressing them in an environmentally appropriate manner.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency proposes to make determinations of base flood elevations and modified base
flood elevations for each community listed below, in accordance with Section 110 of the Flood Disaster Protection
Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed base flood and modified base flood elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria
required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must
change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community
may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State,
or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP
and are also used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations
are made final, and for the contents in these buildings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this proposed rule is exempt from the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because proposed or modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and are required to establish and maintain community eligibility in the NFIP.
No regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Technical information or comments are requested on the proposed base (100-year) flood elevations and proposed base
flood elevation modifications for the communities listed below. The base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis
for the floodplain management measures that the community is required either to adopt or to show evidence of being
already in effect in order to qualify or remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA or Agency) proposes to make determinations of base (100-year) flood
elevations and modified base flood elevations for each community listed below, in accordance with section 110 of
the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed base flood and modified base flood elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria
required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must
change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community
may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, state
or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP
and are also used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations
are made final, and for the contents in these buildings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration.
No environmental impact assessment has been prepared.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this proposed rule is exempt from the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because proposed or modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and are required to establish and maintain community eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency proposes to make determinations of base flood elevations and modified base
flood elevations for each community listed below, in accordance with Section 110 of the Flood Disaster Protection
Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed base flood and modified base flood elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria
required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must
change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community
may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State
or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP
and are also used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations
are made final, and for the contents in these buildings.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this proposed rule is exempt from the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because proposed or modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and are required to establish and maintain community eligibility in the NFIP.
No regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.

This proposed rule amends DFARS 245.608&hyph;70(a)(3) by raising the threshold for screening serviceable and usable
contractor inventory with no national stock number through the Contractor Inventory Redistribution system. The
threshold is raised from $500 to $1,000 to coincide with the $1,000 threshold in FAR 45.608&hyph;2.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply because the proposed rule is not considered to be a significant revision
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It does not have a significant impact beyond the internal operating procedures of the Department of Defense. An initial
regulatory flexibility analysis has therefore not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and
other interested parties.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) issued an alert letter in June 1985 to manufacturers, home
user support organizations, and apnea monitor users, announcing that CDRH had received reports of one death and two
electrical burns that occurred when unsupervised children plugged the male connector pins of the electrode lead
wires from a home apnea monitor system into either alternating current (AC) power cords or a wall outlet, rather than
into the patient cable which connects to the monitor (Ref. 1). In that letter, the agency announced its intention to
embark on a cooperative effort with industry and the medical profession to resolve the problem of potential electrical
connection between patients and electrical power sources. FDA also requested each manufacturer to evaluate its
device for potential electrode lead wire and patient cable hazards and, when necessary, to consider design changes
to preclude insertion of lead wire connectors into AC power cords and outlets. In response, manufacturers voluntarily
began to redesign their electrode lead wires and patient cables for home apnea monitors. In addition to issuing the
alert letter, CDRH's July 1985 Medical Devices Bulletin (a periodic publication that is distributed to the healthcare
community and manufacturers) was devoted in great part to publicizing the lead wire hazard (Ref. 2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1985, FDA has cleared for marketing only those home use apnea monitors with patient cables and lead wires designed
to prevent unsafe electrical connections. This protective design has also been required for all apnea monitors cleared
for marketing since 1989, whether or not they were intended for home use. Nonetheless, some hospitals continue to
use older units, or lead wires and patient cables from other devices, which do not have the protective design. Even
with the new models, it may be possible for staff to switch patient cables and/or lead wires, thereby creating a hazard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 25, 1993, a 12-day old infant being monitored for apnea was electrocuted in a hospital, in Chicago, IL. FDA's
investigation of the incident confirmed that the patient electrode lead wires were unprotected. Specifically,
the male connector pins were not protected to prevent unsafe electrical connections. Although the infant apnea monitor
involved in that incident had been sold with safety protected lead wires and patient cable, an unprotected patient
cable from another manufacturer and unprotected lead wires from a third manufacturer were being used when the infant
was electrocuted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to this incident, on September 3, 1993, FDA issued a safety alert to hospital administrators, risk managers,
and pediatric department directors, warning them that the use of unsafe electrode lead wires with an apnea monitor
may be dangerous to the patient, and may be in violation of section 518(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(the act) (21 U.S.C. 360h(a)) (Ref. 3). FDA included in the alert a number of recommendations to help prevent these
accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On that same day, FDA also sent all apnea monitor manufacturers a notification letter under section 518(a) of the act
(Ref. 4). Section 518(a) of the act authorizes the agency to require that notification be provided when it is necessary
to eliminate an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health and when no other practicable means is available
under the act to eliminate such risk. FDA determined that manufacturer notification under section 518(a) of the act
to all hospitals, clinics, distributors, and suppliers of apnea monitors was necessary to eliminate the unreasonable
risk of harm to infants and other apnea monitor patients from unprotected lead wires and patient cables. FDA stated
that notification should include replacement of unprotected lead wires and patient cables, and that a warning label
should be permanently affixed to all monitors stating that unprotected lead wires and patient cables should not be
used with the device because inappropriate electrical connections may pose an unreasonable risk of adverse health
consequences or death. FDA also requested manufacturers of all apnea monitors to cease further distribution of unprotected
lead wires and patient cables. On September 20, 1993, FDA issued a similar letter to all known manufactures of patient
cables and lead wires (Ref. 5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also has received reports of injuries associated with unsafe lead wires and patient cables involving medical
devices other than apnea monitors (Ref. 6). In 1986, for example, a death resulted in a hospital from electrocardiogram
(ECG) lead wires being plugged into an infusion pump power cord. Similarly, in 1990, a death occurred when neonatal
monitor lead wires were inserted into a pulse oximeter power cord. FDA has received additional reports of similar
events that resulted in electrical shocks and burns to patients. The agency also has received reports of ECG monitor
lead wires being inserted into power sources, causing patient injuries. Finally, FDA has received one report of patient
shock involving an electroencephalograph cable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of devices other than apnea monitors that utilize patient electrodes, e.g., ECG, have been encouraged
by various organizations to modify their lead wires so that they cannot be inserted into AC power cords or outlets.
In February 1987 and May 1993, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) issued hazard reports concerning electrical
shock hazards from unprotected lead wires and patient cables in its publication ``Health Devices'' (Ref. 7). On July
15, 1991, the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) amended its Standard for Medical and Dental Equipment (UL 544) to require
patient-connected lead wires to be designed to avoid connection to electrical power sources. This requirement became
effective on December 1, 1991 (Ref. 8). In March 1993, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) published
a standard for ECG machines, including a safety requirement for leads (601&hyph;2&hyph;25) (Ref. 9). The IEC, as
well as the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), are in the process of developing a
standard for all leads. There is also an existing German standard (DIN 42 802) which has been adopted by some U.S. manufacturers
in their design of safety protected lead wires (Ref. 10). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 28, 1993, FDA issued a Public Health Advisory to hospital nursing directors, risk managers, and biomedical/clinical
engineering departments for distribution to all units in their hospitals and outpatient clinics, as well as to home
health care providers and suppliers affiliated with those facilities, advising them of the hazards associated with
use of electrode lead wires with unprotected male connector pins. (Ref. 11). In the Public Health Advisory, FDA expanded
the scope of its September 3, 1993, apnea monitor safety alert to include all devices using patient electrodes. FDA
noted that, even though manufacturers have changed the design of their devices to minimize the potential hazard,
some facilities are still using older models that make it possible for staff to switch patient cables and/or lead wires,
thus creating a hazard. FDA recommended various precautions to prevent the use of unsafe lead wires and patient cables.

II. Revisions Under Consideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 513(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c(a)), FDA has classified medical devices intended for
human use into one of three regulatory classes, i.e., class I, general controls; class II, special controls; and class
III, premarket approval. Classification depends on the extent of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness
of each device. Apnea monitors, as well as many other medical devices that use patient electrodes, are classified
into class II. Class II devices are devices for which general controls by themselves are insufficient to provide reasonable
assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device, and for which there is sufficient information to establish special
controls to provide such assurance (see 21 CFR 860.3(c)(2)). Possible special controls include the issuance of performance
standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries, development and dissemination of guidelines (including
guidelines for the submission of clinical data in premarket notification submissions in accordance with section
510(k) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)), recommendations, and other appropriate actions as FDA deems necessary to provide
such assurance. (See section 513(a)(1)(B) of the act.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes that, despite efforts to eliminate the risk, unprotected lead wires and patient cabling systems
are still distributed by some manufacturers as replacements for existing equipment, and may also be interchangeable
among various medical devices. In order to reduce the risks to health presented by these devices, the agency is considering
establishing special controls for devices that use lead wires. The agency believes these controls should include,
but not be limited to, the development of a performance standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the development of a performance standard is necessary to reduce or eliminate the hazards of unprotected
lead wires and patient cables. The DIN standard is a design, rather than a performance, standard, and may be too restrictive
for application to all devices. While the proposed AAMI and IEC standards for all leads are more general, they are not
yet completed. Therefore, the agency is considering establishing a standard that resembles the UL standard. The
agency will consider other standards, however, that are finalized before completion of this rulemaking process.
FDA is also considering revising CDRH's Office of Device Evaluation's ``blue book'' to reflect the agency's policy
of not clearing for marketing unprotected male pins that may be used with any device with patient electrodes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is soliciting comments on the issuance of a performance standard that would eliminate the risk of burns and death
associated with placing an unprotected electrode lead wire directly into a power source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is soliciting comments on all aspects of this ANPRM, and specifically requests comments on the following issues:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The current extent of manufacturing, distribution, and use of unprotected patient cables and electrode lead wires
as replacement products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Advantages, if any, of using unprotected electrode lead wires with particular medical devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The devices, if there are any, that cannot accept redesigned electrode lead wires or patient cables.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Cost to manufacturers and the user community to convert to protected electrode lead wires and patient cables for
all medical devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Extent of substitution, if any, of unprotected nonmedical electrode lead wires and patient cables, for use as medical
device electrode lead wires and patient cables.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Essential components of a performance standard for lead wires and patient cables.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Viability of applying a performance standard across device types.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Alternative solutions to the removal of all unprotected electrode lead wires from the market, such as banning them
under 21 CFR part 895.

III. Public Conference
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA, the Health Industries Manufactures Association, and the American Hospital Association are sponsoring a public
conference entitled ``Unprotected Patient Cables and Electrode Lead Wires'' to be held on July 15, 1994. The purpose
of the conference is to: (1) Focus attention on medical devices that use unprotected electrode lead wires; (2) bring
together patient cable and lead wire manufacturers, device manufactures, distributors, users, and purchasers
to facilitate understanding of the electrode lead wire problem and possible solutions, including the development
of performance standards, and the announcement of new regulatory policy for all devices that use patient electrodes;
(3) solicit industry and user input concerning FDA's intention to develop a new regulatory framework for devices
that use patient electrodes; (4) identify the extent of existing and potential design and user problems, including
design applicability for specific devices; and (5) identify the economic impact of the proposed solutions to these
problems.

I. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal contains information collection requirements in &sect;&sect;75.312, 75.342, 75.360, 75.363, 75.364
and 75.382. These paperwork requirements have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review
under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The respondents would be mine operators. The burden
hour estimate for &sect;75.312 includes the time to record any fan monitoring system malfunctions, electrical or
mechanical deficiencies in the monitoring system and any sudden increase or loss in mine ventilating pressure, the
time for recording main mine fan defects that are corrected and for the mine foreman and mine superintendent to countersign
the record. The burden hour estimate for &sect;75.342 includes the time to develop a written maintenance program,
to record the calibration tests and to file the record. The burden hour estimate for &sect;75.360 includes the expanded
examination time and the time for the mine superintendent to countersign the records. The burden hour estimates for
&sect;75.362 includes the expanded examination time. The burden hour estimate for &sect;75.363 includes the time
for recording the hazard, the corrective action taken, the certified person initialing the record, the mine foreman
and mine superintendent countersigning the record and for filing the record. The burden hour estimate for &sect;75.364
includes the time for the mine superintendent to countersign the records. The burden hour estimate for &sect;75.382
includes the time for recording the results of the examination, for the mine foreman and the mine superintendent to
countersign the record, and for filing the record. The information collected would be used by MSHA to assess compliance
with the proposed requirements. The information collection requirements contained in the proposal are discussed
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;75.312(g)(1) would require that the records of all defects found during the daily fan examination
be made by the end of the shift on which the examination is made. The record would be made in a state-approved book or in
a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (g)(2)(i) would require that the certified copies of data produced by the fan monitoring systems
be maintained separate from other computer generated reports or data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (g)(2)(ii) would require that a record be made of any fan monitoring system malfunction, electrical
or mechanical deficiency in the monitoring system and any sudden increase or loss in mine ventilating pressure. The
record would be made by the end of the shift on which the review of the data is completed and would be made in a state-approved
book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (g)(3) would require that at mines permitted to shut down main mine fans under &sect;75.311, if
a pressure recording device is not used, a record be made of the time and fan pressure immediately before the fan is stopped,
and after the fan is restarted and the fan pressure stabilizes. The record would be made in a state-approved book or
in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (g)(4) would require that a record of the results of the tests be made by the end of the shift on which
the monthly test of the automatic fan signal device or the automatic closing doors is completed. Persons making these
tests would record the results of the tests in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered
pages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (g)(5) would require that the records required under paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(4) be countersigned
by the mine foreman, and the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to whom the mine foreman is directly
accountable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA estimates that it would take about 4 minutes for the mine foreman and mine superintendent to countersign the records
and would take an additional 5 minutes to record main mine fan defects corrected and an additional 10 minutes to record
any fan monitoring system malfunctions, electrical or mechanical deficiencies in the monitoring system and any
sudden increase or loss in mine ventilating pressure. The total estimated recordkeeping burden for all affected
mines would be 29,608 hours of which large mines would incur 9,657 hours and small mines would incur 19,951 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph &sect;75.342(a)(4)(ii) would require mine operators to develop and adopt a written maintenance
program that would have to be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the
representative of miners. MSHA estimates that it would take about 1 hour to develop a written maintenance program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(4)(iii) would require that a record of all calibration tests of methane monitors be made in
a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(4)(iv) would require the record of the calibration tests to be kept for one year from the date
of the test and to be retained at a surface location at the mine and made available for inspection by authorized representatives

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Secretary and the representative of miners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A record of calibration tests would be required to be made monthly at all mines. MSHA estimates that it would take about
5 minutes to complete a record. The total estimated recordkeeping burden for all affected mines that concerns developing
a written maintenance program and maintaining a record of tests would be 2,910 hours of which large mines would incur
1,464 hours and small mines would incur 1,446 hours.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;75.360(b)(3) would require a preshift examination to be made for sections capable of producing coal
by energizing equipment on the section. MSHA estimates that this would affect some mines and take up to an additional
hour per examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (f) would require that a record of the results of each preshift examination, including a record
of hazardous conditions and their locations found by the examiner during each examination and of the results and locations
of air and methane measurements, be made in a book provided for that purpose on the surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record would be made by either the certified person who made the examination or by a person designated by the operator.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the record is made by someone other than the examiner, the examiner would be required to verify the record by initials
and date. A record would also be made by a certified person of the action taken to correct hazardous conditions found
during the preshift examination. The records would be countersigned by the mine foreman, and by the mine superintendent,
mine manager, or other mine official to whom the mine foreman is directly accountable. The record would be made in a
state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. MSHA estimates that it would take
about 2 minutes for the mine superintendent to countersign the records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total estimated recordkeeping burden and the extended examination time for all affected mines would be 60,987
hours of which large mines would incur 56,015 hours and small mines would incur 4,972 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;75.362(a)(1) would expand the on-shift examination to include sections where anyone is assigned
to work during the shift, such as those sections where maintenance work is performed. In addition, proposed paragraph
(a)(2) would add a new requirement for on-shift examinations to be conducted to assure compliance with the respirable
dust control parameters specified in mine ventilation plans. MSHA estimates that these provisions will expand on-shift
examinations by up to 45 minutes. MSHA estimates that the total burden hours related to expanding the on-shift examination
would be 111,434, of which small mines would incur 18,007 hours and large mines would incur 93,427 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;75.363 would require that any hazardous conditions discovered be posted, corrected immediately,
and recorded. Proposed paragraph (a) would require a conspicuous danger sign to be posted at any area where hazardous
conditions are found. The hazardous condition would have to be corrected immediately and only persons designated
by the operator to correct or evaluate the condition would be allowed to enter a posted area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) would require that a record including a description and location of the hazardous condition
and the corrective action taken be kept in a book maintained on the surface at the mine. The record would be made by the
completion of the shift on which the hazardous condition is found. This record would not be required for shifts when
no hazardous conditions are found or for hazardous conditions found during the preshift or weekly examinations because
these examinations have separate recordkeeping requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (c) would require that the record be made by either the certified person or by a person designated
by the operator. If the record is made by a person designated by the operator, the certified person would be required
to verify the record by initials and date by or at the end of the shift for which the examination was made. The record would
be countersigned by the mine foreman and by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to whom the
mine foreman is directly accountable. The record would be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential
machine-numbered pages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (d) would require that the record be retained at a surface location at the mine for at least one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year and be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative
of miners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the existing rule, the recordkeeping requirement for on-shift examinations was included in paragraph (g)
of &sect;75.362 and the requirement for retention was in paragraph (h). Under the proposal, paragraphs (g) and (h)
are removed from &sect;75.362 and transferred to paragraphs (c) and (d) of &sect;75.363. As the requirement would
remain the same, there would be no change in the paperwork burden associated with the recordkeeping for on-shift examinations.
However, this recordkeeping requirement would be new for hazardous conditions found during supplemental examinations
and at times when an on-shift examination would not be required. This recordkeeping requirement would also be new
for hazardous conditions found during the examination following a main mine fan stoppage of 15 minutes or longer (75.313).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA estimates that a record of hazardous conditions found during supplemental examinations would be made about
24 times a year at each large mine and about 4 times a year at each small mine. MSHA further estimates that it would take
about 5 minutes to complete a record and an additional 7 minutes for the certified person to initial and the mine foreman
and mine superintendent to countersign the record. The total estimated recordkeeping burden for all affected mines
would be 4,092 hours, of which large mines would incur 3,514 hours and small mines would incur 578 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, MSHA estimates that a record of hazardous conditions found during an examination following a main mine
fan stoppage of 15 minutes or longer would be made about 100 times a year at large mines and 100 times a year at small mines.
MSHA further estimates that it would take about 5 minutes to complete a record and an additional 4 minutes for the mine
foreman and mine superintendent to countersign the record. The total estimated recordkeeping burden for all affected
mines would be 28 hours, of which large mines would incur 14 hours and small mines would incur 14 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;75.364(b) would require an examination for hazardous conditions and for noncompliance with mandatory
safety or health standards that could result in a hazardous condition to be made weekly by a certified person.

Proposed paragraph (h) would require that at the completion of any shift during which a portion of a weekly examination
is conducted a record be made of the results of each weekly examination, including a record of hazardous conditions,
their locations found by the examiner during each examination, the corrective action taken, and the results and location
of air and methane measurements. The record would be made by the person making the examination or a person designated
by the operator. If made by a person other than the examiner, the examiner would be required to verify the record by initials
and date. The record would be countersigned by the mine foreman and by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other
mine official to whom the mine foreman is directly accountable. The record would be made in a state-approved book or
in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA estimates that it would take about 2 minutes for the mine superintendent to countersign the record and an additional
3 minutes to record noncompliance with mandatory safety or health standards that could result in a hazardous condition.
The total estimated recordkeeping burden for all affected mines would be 5,457 hours, of which large mines would incur
3,048 hours and small mines would incur 2,409 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing &sect;75.382(c) requires mechanical escape facilities, including automatic elevators, to be examined
weekly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (h) would require that a record of the results of the examination of mechanical escape facilities,
including any deficiency found and the corrective action taken, be made at the completion of any shift during which
the weekly examination is made. The record would be made by the person making the examination. The record would be countersigned
by the mine foreman and by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to whom the mine foreman is
directly accountable. The record would be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered
pages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (i) would require that the records be retained for at least one year at a surface location at the
mine and made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and representative of miners.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A record of examinations would be required to be made weekly at all mines that would be governed by &sect;75.382. MSHA
estimates that it would take about 5 minutes to complete a record and an additional 4 minutes for the mine foreman and
mine superintendent to countersign the record. The total estimated recordkeeping burden for all affected mines
would be 3,360 hours, of which large mines would incur 3,300 hours and small mines would incur 60 hours.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the complexity of mining increases with the introduction of technological improvements and innovations, MSHA
foresees that electronic storage of records in computer systems could enhance health and safety by facilitating
rapid access to critical information by individuals with the authority and responsibility to direct or redirect
resources to correct potentially unsafe or unhealthy conditions. Records electronically stored also could facilitate
trend analysis, allowing for earlier detection and correction of potential hazards. In addition, the efficiency
of accessing various records at a desktop computer workstation could promote a more integrated and effective approach
to mine safety and health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA is considering allowing electronic storage of the records and certifications required by this proposed rule.
Although the Agency envisions that such storage would most likely be on a personal computer at the mine site, central
storage of the records would not be precluded as long as immediate access to those records at the mine site were available.
The use of electronic media for storage of such records would have to be accessible, secure, verifiable, and provide
for necessary backups. MSHA would require both the availability of immediate screen viewing of the information and
the availability of a hard copy printout within 1 hour of a request by MSHA or an authorized representative of miners.
The records would have to be kept in a secure manner that would preclude alteration once the required information is
correctly entered. MSHA would have to be able to verify that the electronic signature of the persons required to sign
or countersign such records is authentic and entered in a timely manner. Finally, the records would have to be periodically
backed-up on media separate from the computer so that computer failure would not result in the loss of data. Although
MSHA has not specifically included any such provisions in this proposal, the Agency requests comments on the storage
of records on electronic media, in particular on the safeguards necessary to ensure the integrity of such storage.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is proposing to revise the definition of return air in &sect;75.301,
and would revise &sect;&sect;75.310(a)(3), (a)(4) and (c), 75.311(d), 75.312(a), (b)(1), (c), (d), (g)(1), (g)(3),
(g)(4) and (h), 75.313(c)(2), (c)(3), (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(2), 75.321(a), 75.323(b)(1)(ii), (c)(1),
and (d)(2)(i), 75,333(a), (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4) and (e)(1), 75.334(e), 75.340(a), 75.342(a)(4), 75.344(a)(1),
75.360(a), introductory text to (b), (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(6), introductory text to (c), (c)(1), introductory
text to (c)(3) and (f), 75.362(a)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1)(iii), and (d)(2), 75.364(a), (b) and (h), 75.370(a)(3), (c)(1),
and (f), 75.371(b), (s), (z) and (bb), 75.372(b)(3), 75.380(d)(3), (d)(4)(ii), (d)(5), (f) and (i)(2) of its existing
safety standards for ventilation of underground coal mines. MSHA is also proposing to redesignate &sect;75.312(f)
as (f)(1), and paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) as (g)(3) and (g)(4). Section 75.344(b)(2) would be redesignated as &sect;75.344(b)(3).
Existing &sect;75.360(e) would be removed and (f) through (h) would be redesignated as (e) through (g). Existing
&sect;75.362(a)(2), (g) and (h) would be removed and (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) would be redesignated as (d)(1)(ii)
and (d)(1)(iii). Existing &sect;75.370(b)(1) through (f) would be redesignated as (c)(1) through (g). MSHA is further
proposing to add new &sect;&sect;75.312(f)(2), (g)(2), and (g)(5), 75.320(e), 75.330(c), 75.333(h), 75.344(b)(2)
and (e), 75.360(b)(8) through (b)(10), 75.362(a)(2), (d)(1)(i) and (g), 75.363, 75.370(b), 75.372(b)(19) and
(b)(20), 75.380(d)(4)(iii), 75.380(f)(2) and (f)(6) and 75.382(g), (h) and (i). New introductory text would be
added to &sect;75.388(c), and new introductory text would be added to &sect;75.389(c). These revisions are proposed
in accordance with section 101 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. 811. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 15, 1992, MSHA published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 revising its safety standards for ventilation of underground coal mines (57 FR 20868). To assure that mine operators
could effectively plan and implement necessary changes, MSHA delayed the effective date of the final rule from August
16, 1992, to November 16, 1992 (57 FR 34683). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through discussions with the mining community, the Agency became aware of potential problems that could arise through
the implementation of &sect;&sect;75.344(a)(1) and 75.313. MSHA therefore initially stayed these two provisions
until July 1, 1993, (57 FR 53856) extended the stay until July 1, 1994 (58 FR 31908), and has extended the stay until the
completion of this rulemaking (59 FR 18485). Sections 75.314, 75.315 and 75.345 are in effect during the duration
of the stay. As proposed, &sect;75.313 would revise paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(2)
of stayed &sect;75.313 and delete interim &sect;&sect;75.314 and 75.315. Also as proposed, &sect;75.344(a)(1)
would revise stayed &sect;75.344(a)(1) and delete interim &sect;75.345. Section 75.344(a)(1) was stayed to determine
whether requiring all compressors to be located in a noncombustible structure or area could create a fire hazard due
to overheating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.313 was stayed to further consider the effect of fan stoppages in certain mines. As written, the standard
would have allowed circuits and equipment used to withdraw persons from the mine to remain energized until the persons
are withdrawn. The Agency is concerned that under some conditions methane could migrate into haulageways after a
fan stoppage. This could result in a hazard if all underground electrical circuits are not promptly deenergized and
all mechanized equipment is not shut off. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 16, 1992, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) issued
an order staying the application of the air quality standards for oxygen and carbon dioxide at 30 CFR 75.321(a). MSHA
is continuing to litigate this application of the standard. However, in conformance with the Court's order, the Agency
has suspended indefinitely &sect;75.321(a) and redesignated the first sentence of previous &sect;75.301 to remain
in effect as &sect;75.321(c) (57 FR 55457, November 25, 1992). The result is that, with the exception of bleeder systems
and worked-out areas, the Agency is continuing to apply the oxygen and carbon dioxide limits to all areas where persons
work or travel as in previous &sect;75.301. As proposed, &sect;75.321(a) would revise suspended &sect;75.321(a)
and delete interim &sect;75.321(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Underground coal mine ventilation affects various aspects of the safety and health of miners. Proper underground
coal mine ventilation is necessary to protect against mine fires and explosions due in part to the presence of explosive
gases, oxygen-deficient atmospheres, and accumulations of other harmful gases and float coal dust. Ventilation
is also a primary method of controlling miners' exposure to respirable dust and preventing the development of pneumoconiosis
(black lung). In enacting the statutory ventilation standards of the Mine Act, Congress expressly recognized these
and related dangers associated with inadequate ventilation:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[V]entilation of a mine is important not only to provide fresh air to miners, and to control dust accumulation, but
also to sweep away liberated methane before it can reach the range where the gas could become explosive. In terms then
of the safety of miners, the requirement that a mine be adequately ventilated becomes one of the more important safety
standards under the *&blank;*&blank;* Act.

On May 15, 1992, the Agency published a comprehensive revision of its ventilation standards for underground coal
mines. Because of the scope and extensive coverage of the new standards, the Agency held a series of informational
meetings across the country to brief the mining public on the provisions of the new rule. As a result of these meetings
and other comments received by the Agency at meetings with industry and labor groups relative to the ongoing litigation,
as well as its own review of the application of the regulations, MSHA became aware of several provisions that needed
to be further evaluated and analyzed. In many cases, comments received were verbal. Therefore, any references in
this preamble to ``comments'' or ``commenters'' do not necessarily mean either written or formal comments. Persons
wishing to formalize comments made during public meetings or other meetings with the Agency should submit their comments
as a part of this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the proposed standards specified below address the stayed provisions, clarify the Agency's intent,
refine the application of the rule in light of information received, and more fully address the recognized precautions
and procedures necessary to avoid hazards associated with improper ventilation of underground coal mines. Major
areas addressed include: examinations, including preshift examinations; recordkeeping and certification; involvement
of the representative of miners in the plan approval process; escapeway dimensions; equipment in primary escapeways
and fire suppression systems. These standards are intended to fit within the comprehensive structure of the ventilation
rule now in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a segment of the mining community has asserted that certain provisions concerning the installation
and removal of mechanized mining equipment were promulgated without the benefit of adequate comment. The Agency
disagrees. The September 1989 explosion at the William Station Mine in Kentucky demonstrates, however, that proper
ventilation during the installation and removal of mechanized mining equipment is essential and can greatly enhance
the protection provided to miners in these areas. Therefore, for the purpose of receiving and giving full consideration
to all pertinent comments on this issue, MSHA is reproposing each provision that addresses the installation and removal
of mechanized mining equipment, and is soliciting comments for each. The section-by-section portion of the preamble
discusses each provision affected and the proposed rule sets out the reproposed language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publication of the ventilation rule, the Agency has received comments stating that Atmospheric Monitoring
Systems (AMS) should be permitted to operate by battery backup during fan stoppages and not be required to be intrinsically
safe. The commenters indicated that the information thus provided by the AMS would assist the operator in obtaining
information regarding the underground conditions of the mine. To allow the battery backups would require a revision
of &sect;&sect;75.311(h) and 75.313(e). The Agency solicits comments on the merits and the effect on safety of allowing
battery backups and conditions, such as low methane levels, that must exist if they are permitted to be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, since publication of &sect;75.383, the Agency has received comments suggesting that older miners be allowed
to individually decline participation in escapeway drills. The Agency is not proposing any revision to &sect;75.383;
however, comments are solicited as to the appropriateness of providing an option which would allow miners to individually
``opt out'' of escapeway drills, and the circumstances under which miners would be permitted to ``opt out.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency solicits comments on the specific provisions addressed in this proposal. Comments received that also
address other provisions will be considered to the extent that they address the issues relevant to this proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the final rule became effective on November 16, 1992, it has come to the attention of the Agency that the &sect;75.301
definitions of intake and return air are being interpreted in a manner not wholly consistent with the original intent.
Under the proposal, the definition of return air would be modified to more clearly convey the intended meaning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instances have developed where operators desire to take air from an intake air course to ventilate shops, electrical
installations, or for other purposes, and this air is then coursed directly to the surface and is not used to ventilate
working places. Under one reading of the existing definition, because this air has not ventilated a working place
or a worked-out area, the air in this air course cannot be considered return air. Therefore, a violation could exist
in that the air ventilating the shop, compressor, or electrical installation was coursed into an intake rather than
into a return as required. This was not the intent of the Agency and no safety benefit is associated with such a result.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal, the definition of return air would be modified to permit operators to designate certain air courses
as return air courses for the purpose of ventilating structures, areas or installations that are required to be ventilated
to return air courses and for ventilating seals when this air will not be used to ventilate working places. Thus, an
operator wishing to split air off of an intake for the purpose of ventilating shops, electrical installations, or
for other purposes, could designate the air course into which the split is directed as a return provided the air in the
air course would not used to ventilate working places or other locations, structures, installations or areas required
to be ventilated with intake air.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency does not intend that operators routinely redesignate air courses from intake to return. Should questions
arise as to the need to redesignate an intake as a return, MSHA will be available for consultation. Additionally, in
order that all interested parties are made aware of the redesignation, MSHA is proposing to require in &sect;75.372,
Mine ventilation map, that air courses that are redesignated from intake to return for the purposes discussed above
be shown on the mine ventilation map.

Section 75.310&blank;Installation of Main Mine Fans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Main mine fans provide the means by which mechanically produced pressure is supplied to the mine ventilating current.
The Agency is proposing to revise paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4) and (c) of &sect;75.310. The existing standard requires,
in part, that each main mine fan be installed on the surface in an incombustible housing and be connected to the mine
opening with incombustible air ducts. Paragraph (a)(3) of existing &sect;75.310 requires that each main mine fan
be equipped with an automatic device that gives a signal when the fan either slows or stops. The signal from this device
is to be placed so it can be seen or heard by a responsible person who has been designated by the operator and who is always
on duty when persons are underground. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During informational meetings held with the mining community, it was suggested to the Agency that the standard should
be clarified in two respects. First, it was stated that the provision was not clear as to whether the signal must automatically
be given at a surface location at the mine. Second, the Agency was asked to clarify whether a fan monitoring system used
in lieu of a circular pressure recorder to monitor fan pressure must generate a continuous graph or chart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address the first of these concerns, proposed paragraph (a)(3) specifically would require the signal to be given
at a surface location at the mine where it could be seen or heard by a responsible person designated by the operator who
is always on duty when persons are underground. Under the proposal, two-way communication with working sections
would continue to be required. The requirement would be extended to include established locations where persons
are normally assigned to work, such as belt transfer points and shops. This requirement is consistent with existing
Subpart Q_Communications, but may require the installation of a limited number of mine phones at locations off the
section. Many of these locations are routinely equipped with two-way communication even though it is not required
by the existing standard. It is not intended that this communications capability be provided in areas where persons
are assigned to work temporarily, such as areas where secondary roof support is being installed or where rock dust
is being applied. The requirement that two-way communication be provided to locations where persons are normally
assigned to work is intended to assure that these persons receive prompt notification of fan stoppages. Because these
work locations are off the section, a lack of communication capabilities could result in delays in notification and
therefore delays in withdrawal. The requirement that the signal be given at a surface location at the mine is not intended
to preclude the signal from also being given elsewhere, such as at a central office, as long as it is given at the mine
as previously discussed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing rule requires that each main mine fan be equipped with a pressure recording device or a main mine fan monitoring
system. Traditionally, the instrument of choice for recording fan operating pressure has been the mechanical, circular
pressure recorder. As the name implies, this device generates a record of the fan pressure. This record is generated
continuously as a chart that is replaced weekly. Paragraph (a)(4) of the existing rule specifically refers to the
use of a fan monitoring system as an alternative to the pressure recorder. The proposal eliminates this reference
since other means of continuously monitoring the fan pressure and providing a record may be acceptable. Relatively
recent advances in technology have permitted the measurement and recording through other means. This proposed provision
would permit the use of this technology for monitoring main mine fan pressure, provided, as proposed in paragraph
(a)(4), that a continuous record of the pressure is maintained. The proposal would require that when a pressure monitoring
device is used in lieu of a pressure recording device, it produce a continuous graph or chart of the fan pressure. A hard
copy of the continuous graph or chart would be printed at regular intervals of not more than 7 days. The generated graph
or chart would be required to correlate fan pressure to the time and date. The term ``continuous'' refers to the frequency
with which the device polls the fan pressure to obtain the data. It is the Agency's understanding that typical polling
frequency is on the order of a few seconds. MSHA is soliciting comments as to an appropriate polling frequency that
would provide a record that is substantially continuous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Records of the fan pressure generated by a pressure monitoring device would be maintained in accordance with existing
&sect;75.312(h). That is, the records would be maintained at a surface location at the mine for at least one year and
would be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of
miners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to permitting fan monitoring systems to be used as a means of recording fan pressure, the existing rule
permits the use of other devices for measuring fan pressure under certain circumstances. This exception is for mines
permitted to shut down main mine fans as approved in the ventilation plan. As explained more fully in the preamble for
&sect;75.310(a)(4) of the existing rule, this provision provides a compliance alternative for small mines that
normally operate only one shift a day and do not have sealed or unsealed worked-out areas. For these mines, the existing
rule allows the use of a pressure measuring device if the use of the device is approved in the ventilation plan for the
mine. The proposal would continue this practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of the existing rule specifies the minimum requirements for a fan monitoring system, including the
parameters that a fan monitoring system must monitor if it is to be used in lieu of the daily fan check required by &sect;75.312.
The Agency continues to support the use of these systems or any other technology effective in enhancing safety but
believes, based on comments received, that the additional requirements relative to the use of these systems are warranted.
Specifically, commenters suggested that the information generated by fan monitoring systems be provided at a surface
location at the mine where a responsible person is always on duty when persons are underground and that this information
be reviewed by mine management. The Agency agrees with these suggestions and proposes in paragraph (c) to require
that when a fan monitoring system is used in lieu of the daily fan examination required by &sect;75.312 the monitoring
system would be required to have the capability of providing, on demand, a printout of the information being monitored.
This capability is intended to facilitate the review of the information by mine management required in &sect;75.312(b).

Additionally, the proposal would require in paragraph (c)(5) that the fan monitoring system provide monitoring,
records, printouts, and signals at a surface location at the mine where a responsible person designated by the operator
is always on duty and where signals from the monitoring system can be seen or heard while anyone is underground. For
the purpose of the standard, a responsible person would be one who receives the signal and makes proper notification.
As with the requirement that fan stoppage signals be given at a surface location at the mine, this proposed requirement
is not intended to preclude the data from the fan monitoring system from also being provided elsewhere as long as it
is provided at the surface location at the mine. Also, as with the requirement for two-way communication at the location
where fan stoppage signals are monitored, the proposal would require in paragraph (c)(5) that the person at the designated
surface location have two-way communication with working sections and would extend the requirement to established
locations where persons are normally assigned to work, such as belt transfer points and shops. This requirement is
consistent with existing Subpart Q_Communications, but may require the installation of a limited number of mine
phones at locations off the section. Many of these locations are routinely equipped with two-way communication even
though it is not required by the existing standard. It is not intended that this communications capability be provided
in areas where persons are assigned to work temporarily, such as areas where secondary roof support is being installed
or where rock dust is being applied.

Section 75.311&blank;Main Mine Fan Operation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has received comments that notification of mine management officials, having sufficient authority to
initiate corrective actions is needed to assure that repairs are undertaken and to assure continued reliable ventilation
of the mine. Paragraph (d) would be revised to provide for immediate notification of the mine superintendent, assistant
mine superintendent, or mine foreman if any unusual variance in the mine ventilation pressure is observed, or if an
electrical or mechanical deficiency of a main fan is detected. The standard would require appropriate action or repairs
to be instituted promptly. The Agency would expect that any necessary arrangements for repair personnel and replacement
parts would be promptly completed, once the problem or need for repair was identified. One of the actions appropriate
to an unusual variance in pressure would be an immediate investigation into the cause. Notification of mine management
is intended to assure that the appropriate actions are taken and that any necessary repairs are completed as soon as
possible. Both the requirement for notification of mine management and the requirement for prompt initiation of
corrective actions were included in the previous regulation. Although no change was intended, it was suggested that
these requirements be reinstated so as to eliminate any possible confusion that might exist. After reconsideration,
the Agency agrees that the existing standard could be interpreted contrary to the intent and therefore, is proposing
the changes discussed. Since the current ventilation standards became effective on November 16, 1992, questions
have arisen concerning the operation of back-up fans. The following discussion is intended to address the questions
received by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a back-up fan operates in place of the main mine fan, the back-up fan is considered to be a main mine fan and all subpart
D requirements for main mine fans are applicable. These requirements include: the installation requirements of
&sect;75.310, the operation requirements in this &sect;75.311, the examination and recordkeeping requirements
of &sect;75.312, and, the unintentional fan stoppage requirements of &sect;75.313, which would apply should a back-up
fan fail while persons are underground. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A typical back-up fan application is where a back-up fan producing an air quantity comparable to the main mine fan is
substituted upon the unintentional failure of the main mine fan. Section 75.313 would require withdrawal of the miners
if the backup fan, or main mine fan, is not started within 15 minutes. If the back-up fan is started within 15 minutes,
however, normal work may resume after an examination, since the air quantity would be provided. An example would be
two identical fans at a shaft where one operates as the main mine fan while the other is available to back up the main mine
fan. Typically, the usage of these fans is alternated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another possible application is a back-up fan producing a lesser quantity than the main mine fan. In this case, unless
the main mine fan can be restored to operation within 15 minutes, withdrawal would be required under &sect;75.313.
After withdrawal is complete, re-entry could be permitted and electrical circuits restored as provided through
the approved ventilation plan. The Agency would expect operators to rely on engineering data or actual ventilation
survey results when developing these ventilation plan provisions. During operation of the back-up fan, the approved
ventilation plan would only permit activity which is related to maintaining the mine in safe condition. This work
could include pumping, urgent roof support installation, or other safety-related work. The production of coal under
these conditions would not be permitted unless the mine were adequately ventilated and a new ventilation plan has
been approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some multiple-fan ventilation systems are configured such that if one fan fails, reduced air quantities continue
to ventilate all portions of the mine with no potentially hazardous air reversals occurring. In such cases, ventilation
plan provisions, if supported by data, could be developed which would allow re-entry for the purposes discussed in
the previous paragraph. This activity would be limited to maintaining the mine in safe condition until the full ventilation
system is restored to operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under existing &sect;75.311(b)(1), when a main mine fan is stopped intentionally and the ventilating quantity of
the main mine fan is not maintained by a back-up fan, only persons necessary to evaluate the effect of the fan stoppage
or restart, or to perform maintenance or repair work that cannot otherwise be made while the fan is operating, are permitted
underground. The maintenance or repair work which could not be made while the fan is operating is limited to work or
repair which would endanger the safety of the worker if the fan were operating. Examples of the type of work that may
not be possible while the fan is operating could include maintenance of the fan, repairs or adjustments to ventilation
controls immediately inby the fan that are subject to high pressure differentials, and coating of mine surfaces immediately
inby the fan. These examples are given for the purpose of facilitating understanding and are not considered all-inclusive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Agency is proposing to change only paragraph (d) of existing &sect;75.311, comments are specifically solicited
on the issues discussed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 75.312&blank;Main Mine Fan Examinations and Records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency would revise the existing standard in a number of respects. Except in certain situations, a daily examination
of the main mine fans would be required each day that the mine operates. One exception would be the use of a fan monitoring
system in accordance with &sect;75.312. Requirements for training, recording of defects, review of fan monitoring
data, certifying and countersigning of records would be added to the rule. Also, the standard would allow underground
power to remain energized when a fan is shut down for testing of the automatic closing doors and fan signal device, provided
that the fan is restarted within 15 minutes, and would permit an alternative means of testing that would not require
stopping the fan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proper operation of main mine fans is critical to mine ventilation. Paragraph (a) of the proposed rule, like the existing
standard, requires main mine fans and associated components, including devices used to measure and record pressure,
to be examined at least once each day that the fan operates, unless a functioning fan monitoring system is used. However,
it is proposed that on any day when no one goes underground that a fan examination would not be required. The Agency is
proposing this approach along with the provision that an examination of the fan be completed prior to anyone's entering
the mine, including certified persons. Such an examination would assure that the fan is operating properly. The Agency
does not believe that any hazard can be associated with not examining a mine fan if no one goes into the mine, and solicits
comments on this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the informational meetings and later discussions, the Agency was asked to clarify the qualifications of the
person designated by the operator to make daily fan examinations or the weekly fan examination in the case of mines
using fan monitoring systems. It continues to be the position of the Agency that persons assigned to make this or any
other examination must be capable of making an adequate examination; that is, an examination in a manner that assures
the protection sought by the standard. For this reason, and to address the concerns raised, the proposal would adopt
the words of the regulation in effect prior to November 16, 1992, &sect;75.300&hyph;4(a), and require in paragraphs
(a) and (b)(1) that main mine fans be examined by trained persons designated by the operator. Since the purpose of the
examination, as stated in the proposed standard, is to assure the electrical and mechanical reliability of the fan,
the training that the examiner receives should be focused on the electrical and mechanical functioning of fans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal, in paragraph (b)(1)(i), reflects comments received by the Agency that in order for fan monitoring systems
to be effective, the data from these systems must be reviewed by mine management each day. This review is intended to
parallel the daily fan examination and assure that responsible personnel are aware of the performance of the fan and
the fan monitoring system. In paragraph (b)(1)(ii), the proposal would retain the requirement that at least once
every 7 days the monitoring system be tested and the main mine fan be examined. Consistent with paragraph (a), as discussed
previously, this examination would be required to be done by a trained person designated by the operator for the purpose
of assuring the electrical and mechanical reliability of the fan.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the informational meetings and later discussions, the Agency was also requested to clarify the application
of paragraph (c) of this standard. Some of the comments concerned whether underground electrical circuits must be
deenergized while tests of fan signal devices and automatic closing doors are performed. Questions also arose as
to whether anyone could be in the mine during the tests and whether a complete &sect;75.360 preshift examination is
required following the tests before anyone could enter the mine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal clarifies the Agency's intent in paragraphs (c) and (d) of the existing &sect;75.312. The 31-day tests
are to determine if the alarm activates properly and, in multiple-fan systems, whether the automatic doors, if required,
close. Although fan stoppages for these tests are normally of short duration, it must be recognized that on rare occasions
difficulty may be encountered in restarting the fans. Therefore, the Agency has determined that it is not advisable
to allow miners underground during tests when the fan is stopped unless concurrent activities are scheduled that
are necessary to evaluate the effect of the fan stoppage or restart, or to perform maintenance or repair work that cannot
otherwise be done while the fan is operating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter continued to express concern that monthly stoppage of fans for testing can cause undue stress on
the fans. MSHA has received assurances from fan manufacturers that stopping the fans monthly to test the signal device
will not cause undue stress on fans. The Agency has also recently received assurances from motor manufacturers that
monthly stoppage of fans will not harm fan motors. The Agency solicits comments on this issue as well as on any other
aspect of paragraphs (c) and (d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has received requests for clarification as to whether fans stopped for testing must be completely stopped
during the 31-day tests. The purpose of the standard is to assure proper operation of the alarm and doors when a fan fails.
Under certain conditions, such as with a substantial natural ventilating pressure, the fan blades may continue to
rotate indefinitely. However, after power has been removed and the fan is in the process of stopping, once the alarm
sounds and the doors close, the test has been successfully completed and the fan may be restarted even though the fan
blades may not have become motionless. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing that the duration of these tests is normally short, the proposal does not require underground electrical
circuits to be deenergized unless the fan cannot be restarted within 15 minutes or unless persons are permitted underground
in accordance with &sect;75.311(b)(1). In accordance with longstanding practice, as indicated by a review of fan
stoppage plans and consistent with existing &sect;75.313, an examination as described in &sect;75.360 (b) through
(e) would be required if the fan is not restarted within 15 minutes. The Agency believes that after 15 minutes, additional
action is needed to protect miners from the hazards that may develop following a fan stoppage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following publication of the existing standard, commenters suggested that it may be possible to test the fan signals
and the automatic closing doors without shutting off the fans. If it is possible to properly test the fan signal and
automatic closing doors without stopping the fan, then the Agency would permit such an alternative. The Agency has
become aware that such an approach is being actively explored by at least one mining company. Therefore, in the interest
of allowing for advances in technology in this area, the proposal would permit an alternative test that does not require
stopping the fan when the operator demonstrates that it provides the same level of assurance that the automatic closing
doors and fan signals will function as intended during fan stoppages. Alternative approaches to stopping the fan
would be required to be approved in the ventilation plan. The Agency would anticipate that any alternative approach
approved would retain the 31 day interval for demonstrating that the automatic closing doors or fan signal will operate
as intended. The Agency solicits comments on this approach to fan tests. Specifically, comments should address the
method that should be used to assure that the alternate test provides the same level of assurance that the automatic
closing doors and fan signals will function as intended during fan stoppages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(1) retains the requirement in the existing rule that persons making main mine fan examinations certify
by initials and date at the fan or another location specified by the operator, that the examinations were made, and
that each certification identify the main mine fan examined. Consistent with the practice of certifying that fan
examinations have been completed, the Agency is proposing a certification requirement in paragraph (f)(2). The
person completing the review of the data from a fan monitoring system used in lieu of daily fan examinations would certify
that the review has been completed. The manner of certification would be by initials and date on the printout of the
data from the system. To facilitate this certification, proposed &sect;75.310(c)(3), as discussed previously,
would require that the fan monitoring system be capable of providing, on demand, a printout of the data.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(5) would set out the requirements for recordkeeping and countersigning
of main mine fan examination records. Paragraph (g)(1) would require that by the end of the shift on which the examination
is made, persons making main mine fan examinations would record all defects found during the examination that may
affect the operation of the fan. Unlike the previous standard, the existing standard requires that only defects that
are not corrected by the end of the shift be recorded. The preamble to the existing rule explains this approach as follows:
``*&blank;*&blank;* since the main purpose of this recordkeeping requirement is to alert miners on oncoming shifts
of defects found during the fan examination that may affect their shifts, it serves no additional safety benefit to
require a record to be made of deficiencies which are corrected by the end of the shift on which the examination is made.''
However, following publication of the standards, the Agency received comments that records of defects, corrected
or not, serve to indicate recurring problems with mine fans. Upon reconsideration, MSHA agrees that recurring problems
found during main mine fan examinations may be indicative of more serious defects and if mine management is not made
aware of these problems through the maintenance of records they could ultimately lead to a fan failure. Therefore,
similar to the previous standard, the proposal would require that all defects found during the daily fan examination
be recorded. As with other proposed provisions of the rule, records required in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(4)
would be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. Comments are specifically
solicited on this approach and on an alternative approach wherein the Agency would develop, in coordination with
the states, books specific for the required records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since promulgation of the current regulation, the Agency has become aware of some potential difficulties in reviewing
records and data generated by fan monitoring systems and atmospheric monitoring systems. The problem involves the
commingling of this information with other information, such as production or operations-related data produced
by the computer systems of which they are a part. Since the physical volume of production, operations, and other data
may be considerable, safety-related data may not be readily accessible which may discourage the regular review and
proper use of the information. A possible solution is to require that all safety related data be printed on a dedicated
printer. The Agency is not proposing this solution at this time but rather is soliciting comments on possible alternative
solutions. At this time, the Agency is proposing, in paragraph (g)(2)(i), that the certified copies of data required
by paragraph (f)(2) be maintained separate from other computer generated reports or data in order to facilitate the
review of this data by the operator, the representative of miners, and the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (g)(2)(ii) would require a record to be made of any fan monitoring system malfunctions, electrical
or mechanical deficiencies in the monitoring system and any sudden increase or loss in mine ventilating pressure.
The records would be used to identify chronic or recurring problems with the system that could indicate the need for
repairs, replacement of parts, or upgrades in hardware or software in order to keep the system functioning in a reliable
manner. The record would be required to be made by the end of the shift on which the review of the data is completed. This
requirement would help to assure that records are current and that potential problems are identified in a timely manner.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with existing requirements, paragraph (g)(3) would require that at mines permitted to shut down main
mine fans under &sect;75.311, if a pressure recording device is not used, a record be made of the time and fan pressure
immediately before the fan is stopped, and after the fan is restarted and the fan pressure stabilizes. A record of these
pressures at both shutdown and restart would help identify any adverse change in ventilation that may have occurred
during the fan stoppage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(4) would require that a record of the results of the tests be made by the end of the shift on which the monthly
test of the automatic fan signal device or the automatic closing doors is completed. This requirement would help to
assure that potential problems are identified in a timely manner so that proper operation of the automatic fan signal
device and the automatic closing doors can be maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(5) would require that the records required under paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) be countersigned by
the mine foreman by the end of the mine foreman's next regularly scheduled working shift. During an absence of the mine
foreman, the person acting as mine foreman would countersign. The Agency intends that the mine foreman, the person
most responsible for the day-to-day operation of the mine, be notified of the information contained in the reports.
Allowing until the end of the mine foreman's next regularly scheduled working shift to countersign the report would
assure that the mine foreman is aware of the results of the examination and would enable corrective actions to be taken.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would also require that within two scheduled production days after the mine foreman has countersigned,
the record of the examination be countersigned by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to
whom the mine foreman is directly accountable. The intent of the proposal is to assure that a higher level official,
empowered to redirect resources, be aware of any condition requiring corrective actions. Since this second level
official may not be physically located at the mine on a full-time basis, two scheduled production days are proposed
as a reasonable period of time for countersigning.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This standard establishes safety precautions for any unplanned main mine fan stoppage that interrupts ventilation
while persons are underground. Paragraph (a)(3) requires all persons to be withdrawn from working sections and areas
where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed when ventilation is interrupted by a main mine fan
stoppage. Areas where coal is being extracted or mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed are typically
the places in an underground mine where methane accumulation and other hazards to health or safety can develop quickly
when ventilation is interrupted. To avoid exposure of miners to these hazards, timely withdrawal of persons is an
important safety practice. Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of paragraph (a)(3) of this standard
was done appropriately, it is being reproposed for the purpose of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent
comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerns have been raised about the possibility of methane migration following fan stoppage, and the danger of using
electrical power to withdraw miners should this occur.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would revise stayed &sect;75.313(c)(2) and (c)(3) which address deenergization of electric power
circuits and shutting-off of mechanized equipment not located on working sections. It also would revise paragraph
(d)(1)(i) and (ii) and (d)(2) which deal with examination of the mine before miners can return when power is restored.
The Agency is not proposing a revision of paragraphs (a), (b), (c)(1), and (e) at this time. These paragraphs of stayed
&sect;75.313 would remain unchanged from the stayed provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (c)(2) of the proposal, underground electrical circuits must be deenergized, except those circuits
necessary for withdrawal if such circuits are located in areas and haulageways where methane is not likely to migrate
into or accumulate. The remaining energized circuits would be deenergized as persons are withdrawn. The Agency recognizes
that in a limited number of mines methane may migrate from adjacent areas and enter travelways or haulageways used
by miners for withdrawal. Under these conditions, permitting power circuits to remain energized may increase the
potential for a methane ignition. The determination of the likelihood of methane migrating into haulageways can
be made through underground tests or computer simulations of ventilation systems. It is the intention of the Agency
that when it is determined that methane is likely to accumulate or migrate into an area, electrical circuits used for
transportation would not be permitted to remain energized and persons would not be permitted to ride out of the mine
in the event of a fan stoppage. The Agency would expect the operator to provide the necessary data from which a determination
can be made. For the same reasons, paragraph (c)(3) of the proposal would require mechanized equipment not located
on working sections to be shut off unless the equipment is necessary to withdraw persons from the mine and is located
in areas where methane migration or accumulation is unlikely to occur. The Agency solicits comments on the appropriateness
of this type of mine-specific evaluation that balances the expeditious withdrawal of miners against the potential
for methane accumulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of the proposal, the Agency is clarifying that when ventilation is restored and
before electrical circuits are energized or nonpermissible mechanized equipment is started, no one other than designated
certified examiners would be permitted to enter or reenter any underground area of the mine until an examination is
conducted as described in &sect;75.360(b) through (e) and the area is determined to be safe. This would prohibit nonpermissible
mechanized equipment from being started until an examination is completed. However, permissible equipment may
be used to facilitate the examination required by the proposal. The Agency recognizes that it may not be possible for
examiners to enter the mine without some power being restored in shafts or slopes to power elevators, hoists, or other
mechanical facilities operated in the shaft or slope. The Agency does not intend to prohibit these facilities from
being energized when used to facilitate the examination, provided they are in intake air and the power is limited to
the shaft or slope in which they operate. The Agency solicits comments on this approach to fan stoppages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This examination would not be equivalent to a full-scale preshift examination in that (1) a preshift is conducted
within 3 hours preceding the beginning of the shift, and (2) the recordkeeping requirements of &sect;75.360 would
not apply for the examination following a fan stoppage. However, in accordance with proposed &sect;75.363, a record
of all hazardous conditions found would be required. This type of examination is an accepted safety practice in the
industry. It is a primary means for determining the effectiveness of a mine's ventilation system and of detecting
hazards such as methane accumulations that may be present in travelways or other areas where miners may work after
an interruption of ventilation. After a fan is restarted, the examination will determine if the air is moving in its
proper direction and at its normal volume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has reconsidered its position in stayed &sect;75.313(d)(2) and proposed in paragraph (d)(2) to specifically
require miners, other than designated certified examiners, to continue to the surface should the fan restart during
withdrawal. A commenter has maintained that following a fan stoppage, a hazard could occur due to methane accumulations,
and therefore miners should not be permitted to remain underground. MSHA agrees that such methane accumulations
could occur, but believes that any risk of ignition would be significantly reduced by the requirement that mechanized
equipment be shut off and electrical power circuits deenergized except for equipment and power circuits necessary
for withdrawal if located in areas or haulageways where methane is not likely to migrate to or accumulate. Under stayed
&sect;75.313, the equipment or circuits used for withdrawal must be shut off or deenergized as persons are withdrawn.
However, to provide an added margin of safety, MSHA is proposing withdrawal of all miners to the surface except designated
certified examiners who may begin the examination required before miners return to underground areas. The Agency
specifically solicits comments on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter further stated that when a fan is down for an extended period of time, a fan should not be restarted until
miners safely reach the surface. However, as stated in the preamble to the existing rule, MSHA believes that the fan
should be restarted as soon as possible to reestablish proper ventilation and to remove the potential for methane
accumulations. The Agency solicits comments on the pros and cons of reestablishing ventilation by restarting a mine
fan during evacuation, and on having miners continue to the surface should a fan restart during withdrawal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, the proposal would require that an examination be made as described in &sect;75.360(b) through (e).
Although complete withdrawal of miners is required, this examination could begin once ventilation has been restored
and would be performed by certified persons designated by the operator to conduct the examination. The Agency is proposing
this approach because of the safety concerns associated with extended interruptions in the ventilation system.
It is recognized that under &sect;75.360(a) a preshift examination can be made for an oncoming shift while miners
are underground. However, the proposal would not allow miners to remain underground because of the lack of ventilation
compared to the situation where ventilation is continuously maintained.

The informational meetings and later discussions on the rule indicated that simply requiring detectors for measuring
methane and oxygen deficiency to be maintained in permissible condition does not completely satisfy the need for
assuring proper maintenance. It was suggested that without a requirement for maintenance to be done by a trained person,
similar to that which existed in the previous standard, a person with less than the necessary understanding of the
instrument and the permissibility requirements might be assigned the task. The proposal would require that methane
detectors and other devices be properly maintained at all times and, to assure the appropriate level of maintenance,
the proposal in paragraph (e) would require this maintenance to be done by a trained person. This does not preclude
the operator from sending instruments to the manufacturer or another repair facility for regular servicing.

Additionally, the proposal would require the operator to assure that any instrument sent underground is in permissible
condition so that the use of the instrument does not pose an explosion hazard. The level of care that must be exercised
is of course a function of instrument usage but, at a minimum, the Agency would expect that the detector be visually
examined to assure that it is properly assembled and that all necessary components such as screws, lenses, and indicator
lamps are present. As with the requirement that maintenance be done by a trained person, this requirement was present
in the previous standard and is being proposed to further assure that methane detectors do not pose a hazard and will
perform properly during the shift.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would continue a basic air quality requirement that has been in place since 1970 that air in areas where
persons work or travel contain at least 19.5 percent oxygen and not more than 0.5 percent carbon dioxide, and the volume
and velocity of the air current in these areas be sufficient to dilute, render harmless, and carry away flammable,
explosive, noxious, and harmful gases, dusts, smoke, and fumes. The proposal would not require this carbon dioxide
level to be applied to bleeder entries and worked-out areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA has interpreted former &sect;75.301 to require at least 19.5 percent oxygen and no greater than 0.5 percent carbon
dioxide in bleeder systems where persons work or travel. Similarly, it was the intent of the Agency to enforce &sect;75.321
to require compliance with these levels where persons would be exposed in bleeder entries and in worked-out areas.
However, the application of this provision to bleeders has been stayed by the D.C. Circuit pending the outcome of litigation
on the rule. The Agency continues to believe that providing satisfactory air quality is essential to protect the miners
and examiners whenever they work or travel in bleeder entries and worked-out areas. Therefore, the proposal includes
a new provision specifying that the air in bleeder entries and worked-out areas where persons work or travel contain
at least 19.5 percent oxygen, and that carbon dioxide not exceed 0.5 percent TWA (Time Weighted Average) and 3.0 percent
STEL (Short Term Exposure Limit). A TWA is the time-weighted average concentration for a normal 8-hour workday and
a 40-hour workweek. A STEL is a 15-minute TWA exposure which can not be exceeded at any time during a workday even if the
8-hour TWA is within the specified TWA. Exposures above the TWA up to the STEL can not be longer than 15 minutes and can
not occur more than four times per day. There must be at least 60 minutes between successive exposures in this range.
These proposed levels are identical to the levels contained in MSHA's proposed air quality standards for coal and
metal and nonmetal mines and the 1992 Threshold Limit Values (TLV) as specified by the American Conference of Governmental
Industrial Hygienists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the ongoing air quality rulemaking, the Agency is not at this time proposing to modify existing air quality
standards as applied to areas where persons work or travel, other than bleeder entries and worked-out areas. The Agency
will consider the appropriate course of action on this issue as part of the air quality rulemaking.

Bleeder entries and worked-out areas are required to be traveled or evaluated at least weekly. This is most often done
by a person traveling alone who is often required to be in the bleeder entries or worked-out areas for an extended period.
The purpose of this standard is to protect miners, not to regulate air quality where persons are not exposed. Therefore,
oxygen and carbon dioxide levels at bleeder connectors and bleeder evaluation points that do not meet the proposed
concentrations would not constitute a violation of the standard if examinations are performed remotely or if persons
making the examination can otherwise remain in air that meets the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (NIOSH Respirator Decision Logic, May 1987), 19.5 percent oxygen provides an adequate amount of oxygen
for most work assignments and incorporates a safety factor. Also according to NIOSH, the safety factor is needed because
oxygen-deficient atmospheres offer little warning of danger. In the NIOSH publication, ``A Guide to Safety in Confined
Spaces,'' (page 4), a chart is presented that indicates that 19.5 percent oxygen is the minimum level for safe entry
into an area, and that at a level of 16 percent, judgement and breathing are impaired. The American National Standards
Institute (ANSI), in ANSI Z88.2&hyph;1992, ``American National Standard for Respiratory Protection'' recognizes
that at 16 percent oxygen there is an impairment in the ability to think and pay attention, and a reduction in coordination.
ANSI recognizes that at 19 percent oxygen there are some adverse physiological effects, but they are unnoticeable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for regulating the oxygen level where persons work or travel in bleeder entries is illustrated by two mining
accidents. One of these accidents resulted in the death of a mine examiner and the second resulted in the near death
of two additional individuals, one of whom was a mine examiner. Mine examiners are, through training and experience,
the individuals best able to identify the hazards associated with irrespirable atmospheres. The first accident
occurred at the Arclar Mine in Equality, Illinois in 1989. Prior to implementation of the existing standard, a mine
examiner, for unknown reasons, entered a worked-out area that was posted with a danger sign. Under the existing regulation,
ventilation or sealing of this area, rather than posting, would be required. Because the area was not sealed, the existing
regulation would require the area to be examined during the weekly examination. The proposal would require that the
route of travel for the examiner would contain at least 19.5 percent oxygen. Had the proposal been in place when the
examiner entered the worked-out area, there is a strong likelihood that he would not have died.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second accident, although not in a bleeder entry or worked-out area, is illustrative of what can happen when individuals,
including mine examiners, are subjected to oxygen deficient air. In 1983 at the Bird No. 3 Mine in Riverside, Pennsylvania,
an assistant mine foreman, a certified person, entered the mine for the purpose of conducting an examination. After
traveling approximately 1100 feet, the examiner became dizzy, noticed that his flame safety lamp had extinguished
and withdrew approximately 200 feet where he sat down and apparently became unconscious. A second individual upon
entering the area in search of the examiner also became dizzy but was able to withdraw to a location that was not oxygen
deficient. When the mine examiner regained consciousness, his cap lamp battery had discharged and he traveled in
total darkness until he encountered a mine rescue team. Air samples collected in the area where the mine examiner first
became dizzy indicated an oxygen concentration of about 16.8 percent, while other samples collected nearby indicated
oxygen concentrations of nearly 20 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because mine examiners are required to work or travel in areas where oxygen-deficient air could occur without warning,
and they normally travel and work alone, there must be a requirement that provides them the protection necessary for
the performance of their duties under these conditions. It is important that the level for oxygen be established above
that identified as resulting in impaired judgement because it is essential that individuals traveling in these areas
remain highly alert. The hazards that can exist in bleeder entries and worked-out areas include elevated methane
levels, poor footing, loose and unstable roof, and water accumulations. For this reason, the Agency is proposing
to adopt a minimum level of oxygen of 19.5 percent as recommended by NIOSH.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA is also concerned with the effects of other gases often found in bleeder entries. Section 75.322 of the existing
regulation limits the concentration of noxious or poisonous gases to the current (1971) Threshold Limit Values (TLV's)
as adopted and applied by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Section 75.322
specifically excludes carbon dioxide since it is covered by &sect;75.321. However, in light of the Court's stay of
&sect;75.321(a) relative to bleeder entries, the Agency is proposing a separate standard for carbon dioxide levels
for areas where persons work or travel in bleeder entries and worked-out areas. The levels proposed, 0.5 percent TWA
and 3.0 percent STEL, when considered in conjunction with the requirements of &sect;75.322 and the proposed requirement
for oxygen, will aid in providing persons working or traveling in these areas with a safe and healthful working environment.
The Agency recognizes that the effects of carbon dioxide are both chronic and acute and has therefore elected to propose
both a time weighted average and a short term exposure limit. NIOSH, in recommending a standard for carbon dioxide,
also recognized this and recommended a similar approach. The NIOSH recommendation, made in a Criteria Document published
in 1976, proposed a TWA concentration of 1.0 percent and a ceiling value of 3.0 percent not to exceed 10 minutes. In making
this recommendation, NIOSH states that there are ``additive stress effects of increased carbon dioxide concentrations
and exercise *&blank;*&blank;*'' As support for this, the NIOSH document cites research that showed that healthy,
trained subjects exposed to 2.8 to 5.2 percent carbon dioxide at maximum exercise levels experienced respiratory
difficulty, impaired vision, severe headache, and mental confusion; three subjects collapsed. At or below 2.8 percent
carbon dioxide combined with lower, but still strenuous, levels of exercise, no ill effects other than awareness
of increased ventilation were experienced by the subjects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During rulemaking on the proposed air quality standard, NIOSH recommended a 0.5 percent TWA and a 3.0 percent STEL.
NIOSH made a similar recommendation to OSHA during that Agency's permissible exposure limit (PEL) rulemaking. Given
the work environment in bleeder entries and worked-out areas, as described earlier, the Agency believes that the
dual regulatory approach proposed is appropriate. In addition to examiners, other miners may be required to work
in the bleeder entries and worked-out areas, performing duties such as installing roof support, pumping water, recovering
materials or adjusting ventilation. The levels proposed would provide them with the necessary protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, MSHA is concerned with the synergistic effects that carbon dioxide has on the body when combined with
low oxygen levels, especially at levels higher than 0.5 percent TWA. Carbon dioxide affects the blood pH, which is
critical to the proper metabolism of oxygen. Because of the nature of the hazardous work environment in bleeder entries
and worked-out areas, the Agency believes that it must be careful to establish levels which would not impact on the
body's ability to deal with the conditions encountered. The Agency solicits comments on the appropriateness of these,
or other concentration levels for carbon dioxide in areas where the examiner works or travels in bleeder entries and
worked-out areas, along with the rationale for determining the appropriate level for bleeder entries and worked-out
areas. However, as stated previously, it is not the intent of the Agency that the levels established in paragraph (2)
of the proposed standard be applied to areas other than those areas within the bleeder entries and worked-out areas
where persons work or travel. In light of this, it is not anticipated that many of the nation's coal mines would be required
to increase the volume of air currently being used to ventilate bleeders and worked-out areas as a result of this proposed
standard.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSHA is proposing to revise paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (c)(1), and (d)(2)(i) of the existing standard in response to
comments made during informational meetings and subsequent discussions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methane poses a significant hazard to miners when it is permitted to accumulate without corrective action being taken
quickly. The Agency received comments at its informational meetings asking MSHA to clarify when ventilation changes
must be made to reduce methane concentrations to acceptable levels. MSHA has always intended that these changes be
made at once. In response to these comments, the Agency is proposing to revise paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (c)(1) and (d)(2)(i)
to require that these changes be made ``at once,'' the phrase used in former &sect;&sect;75.308 and 75.309. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of paragraph (b) of this standard was done appropriately, it is
being reproposed with the addition of the phrase ``at once'' for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration
to all pertinent comments. When 1.0 percent or more methane is present in a working place, an intake air course, or an
area where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed, paragraph (b)(1) would require all electrical,
diesel, and battery-powered equipment in the affected working place, intake air course or other area, except for
intrinsically safe AMS, to be deenergized or shut off. Deenergizing or shutting off this equipment would protect
miners by preventing this equipment from providing ignition sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If 1.5 percent methane or more is present in a working place, an intake air course, or an area where mechanized mining
equipment is being installed or removed, paragraph (b)(2) would require persons to be withdrawn from the affected
area. The basic requirement for withdrawal of persons is retained from the previous standard and the reproposal would
expand this basic requirement to include areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed.
The presence of methane in these areas can pose a significant risk to miners and therefore their withdrawal from the
affected area is essential to their safety. Paragraph (b)(2) would also require that all electric power to equipment
in affected areas be disconnected at the power source. This prevents accidental reenergization of equipment and
removes power from cables and circuits which may also be ignition sources. No other work is permitted in the affected
area until the concentration of methane is less than 1.0 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(2) would be amended by adding ``mechanized'' before mining equipment for consistency with other provisions
of the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSHA is not proposing any changes to the wording of &sect;75.324 at this time. The following discussion clarifies
MSHA's interpretation of what the Agency considers to be an intentional change that could materially affect the safety
or health of persons in the mine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of the existing rule requires that a ventilation change be supervised by a person designated by the mine
operator when a change in section ventilation is in excess of a specified quantity or when a ventilation change alters
the main air current of the mine or any split of the main air current in a manner that could materially affect the safety
or health of miners underground. Paragraph (b) of the existing rule specifies additional requirements that apply
only to the ventilation changes described in paragraph (a) of this section. That is, before such an intentional air
change is made, electric power must be removed from areas that may be affected by the change and mechanized equipment
in those areas must be shut off. Also, only persons making the ventilation change are permitted in the mine while the
change is being made. Afterward, certified persons must examine the areas affected by the change to determine whether
methane accumulations or oxygen deficiencies have resulted. Electric power is not permitted to be restored to affected
areas nor is mechanized equipment to be restarted until these tests have been made and the areas are determined to be
safe.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since this standard went into effect in November 1992, the Agency has become aware of concerns suggesting that it is
sometimes difficult to determine whether an intentional change in the air current could materially affect the safety
or health of miners. However, MSHA regards it as impractical to follow a ``cookbook'' approach to identifying what
will or will not require approval. Each circumstance is to be reviewed by the operator on its own merits. To illustrate
the Agency's expectations, the following is a list of some examples of what MSHA considers intentional changes that
would materially affect the safety or health of miners. These examples are not meant to include all possibilities,
but are meant to provide some general guidance: adding a new shaft; bringing a new fan on line; changing the direction
of air in an air course; changing the direction of air in a bleeder system; shutting down one fan in a multiple fan system;
starting a new operating section with ventilating quantities redistributed from other sections of the mine; changing
entries from intakes to returns and vice versa; and any change that affects the information required by &sect;75.371,
Mine ventilation plan; contents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of changes to a complex ventilation system are not always easy to predict, and for that reason caution must
be used when making significant changes to one air split or several air splits. The balance of splits can be affected
and may result in air reversals, dead air spaces, or insufficient air flow in critical areas. For this reason, such
changes must be evaluated by a certified person examining the affected areas before production is resumed. Approval
is required by paragraph (c) of &sect;75.370 Mine ventilation plan; submission and approval, if the change alters
the main air current in a manner that could materially affect the safety or health of miners. When questions arise as
to whether an anticipated change requires prior approval, MSHA is available to discuss the situation for guidance
on whether a request for approval should be submitted. While the Agency is not contemplating a change to &sect;75.324
at this time, comments are specifically solicited on the issues discussed.

Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of paragraph (d) of this standard was done appropriately, it is

would require that areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed be ventilated and that the
quantity of air and the ventilation controls necessary to provide these quantities be specified in the approved ventilation
plan. As demonstrated by the explosion at the William Station Mine, ventilation of these areas is essential and will
greatly enhance the protection provided to miners.

During the informational meetings and later discussions, it became apparent that members of the mining community
were concerned about the appropriateness of using a performance standard relative to the volume of air that must be
provided to working faces. It was suggested that such an approach suffered from two flaws: (1) By simply requiring
sufficient air, a problem could develop and go unnoticed before corrective action is required; and (2) since most
miners do not have the means for measuring ventilation parameters; i.e., anemometers and methane detectors, it may
not be possible for the average miner to determine compliance with the performance standard. It has been suggested
that in addition to the performance standard, the Agency should propose requirements for line brattice similar to
those that existed in the previous regulation. After considering this recommendation in light of the expressed concerns,
the Agency is proposing, in paragraph (c), that when a line brattice or other face ventilation control device is damaged
to the extent that ventilation of the working face is inadequate, production activities would cease until necessary
repairs are made. It is the intent of the Agency to assure that damaged ventilation controls are repaired and that mining
is discontinued until adequate face ventilation is restored.

Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of paragraph (a)(1) of this standard was done appropriately,
it is being reproposed for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent comments. The ventilation
of working areas has historically been accomplished through the use of a separate split of intake air. The proposal
would provide this same level of protection to miners working in areas where equipment is being installed or removed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is not proposing any changes to &sect;75.332 at this time. However, questions have come to the attention
of the Agency concerning the existing standard. The following discussion is intended to address these questions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing requirements of &sect;75.332 are largely derived from earlier MSHA regulations (&sect;75.311 and
&sect;75.312). Under existing &sect;75.332, air which has passed through any area not examined under &sect;75.360,
&sect;75.361 or &sect;75.364, or through any area which has been second mined, cannot be used to ventilate any working
place. After the rule became effective, it was suggested that it would be possible to ventilate working places with
intake air coursed through an evaluated, nonpillared worked-out area, because evaluation in lieu of travel to the
point of deepest penetration is at some times acceptable under &sect;75.364. As explained in the following discussion,
this is not the case. Existing &sect;75.332(a)(1) requires that each working section and each area where mechanized
mining equipment is being installed or removed be ventilated by a separate split of ``intake air.'' Existing &sect;75.301
defines return air as ``Air that has ventilated the last working place of any working section or any worked-out area,
whether pillared or nonpillared *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Reading these two existing provisions together, one concludes
that air that has ventilated a worked-out area is return air and therefore cannot be used to ventilate any working section
or any area where equipment is being installed or removed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A second question concerns the conditions under which air that has passed by an unsealed worked-out area can be used
to ventilate a working section. Worked-out areas that are not sealed must be ventilated, &sect;75.334(a). Under
&sect;75.332(b)(1) the air used to ventilate worked-out areas cannot be used to ventilate working sections, unless
examined in accordance with &sect;75.360, &sect;75.361, or &sect;75.364. There is only one condition under which
air that passes by a worked-out area that is not examined can be used to ventilate a working section or an area where equipment
is being installed or removed. This is when the worked-out area is ventilated by a separate split of air and the remainder
of the intake air continues past the worked-out area. This remaining intake air could be used to ventilate a working
section or an area where equipment is being installed or removed. However, the air that enters the worked-out area
cannot reenter the intake air course because the definition of return air, in &sect;75.301, states in part that ``If
air mixes with air that has ventilated the last working place on any split of any working section or any worked-out area,
whether pillared or nonpillared, it is considered return air.'' In the case of worked-out areas with multiple openings,
this would preclude air from being used to ventilate a working place when it enters a worked-out area in one entry and
exits the worked-out area in another entry to remix with the air passing by. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine that the air that has passed by a worked-out area has not been contaminated, proposed &sect;75.360(b)(4)
would require that when intake entries carry air by worked-out areas to ventilate working places where persons are
scheduled to work, the approaches to the worked-out areas be preshift examined immediately inby and outby each entry
that carries air into the worked-out area. The purpose of this examination is to assure that the air is not oxygen deficient
and does not contain methane in excess of allowable limits and to determine that the air is not coming from the worked-out
area. By preshift examining the intake entries in these areas, it can be determined that the air in these entries is
suitable for use in working places. Additionally, proposed &sect;75.360(b)(4) would require that when intake entries
carry air by worked-out areas to ventilate working places where persons are scheduled to work, the entries used to
carry air into the worked-out area be preshift examined at a point immediately inby the intersection of each entry
with the intake air course. Preshift examining of these entries is intended to assure that air that enters a worked-out
area in one entry does not reenter the intake air course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing to revise paragraphs (a), (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), and (e)(1) and add new paragraph (h) to &sect;75.333.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(4) would be revised to clarify the application of the permanent ventilation
control standards when a continuous face haulage system is used. Continuous face haulage systems employ mobile bridge
conveyors to transport coal directly from the continuous mining machine to a low profile conveyor belt. The mobile
bridge system uses a ``dolly'' to transfer the coal to the low profile conveyor belt at the section loading point. Because
the dolly travels along the low profile conveyor belt, the location of the section loading point changes during mining
as the mobile bridge dolly moves. For escapeway purposes, paragraph (b)(4) would designate the loading point for
a continuous haulage system as the inby most point of travel of the dolly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, the Agency has not required the use of permanent ventilation controls to separate continuous face haulage
systems from return, intake, or primary escapeway entries in rooms developed 600 feet or less from the centerline
of the entry from which the rooms were developed. As with the existing standard, proposed paragraph (b)(1) would require
permanent stoppings or other permanent ventilation control devices between intake and return air courses, except
temporary controls may be used in rooms that are 600 feet or less from the centerline of the entry from which the room
was developed. The proposal would clarify the existing standard by explicitly stating that when continuous face
haulage systems are used, temporary controls may be used to separate the system from the return and intake in rooms
developed 600 feet or less from the centerline of the entry from which the rooms were developed. Because the room in
which the continuous haulage system is installed is continuously attended by the system operators, an immediate
response to any safety-related problem with the haulage system would be expected. Additionally, two or three rooms
are often concurrently developed using this system and the life of the actively developing rooms is often less than
three days. The result of this short life is that mining in these rooms would often be completed before construction
of permanent controls is finished. The proposal recognizes the short-lived nature of these rooms and permits the
use of properly constructed temporary controls to deliver ventilation to the faces. Requiring the construction
of permanent controls in these instances would result in no additional safety benefit. The Agency has also received
comment that additional material handling hazards would be associated with the transportation of permanent control
construction materials into an often limited number of rooms during development. Additionally, access to the continuous
haulage system is required through crosscuts for maintenance and operation of the system.

For these reasons, proposed paragraph (b)(3) would also be revised to require that when continuous face haulage systems
are used, permanent stoppings or other permanent ventilation control devices must be built and maintained to separate
the haulage entry in which the low profile belt structure is located from intake entries only to the outby travel point
of the dolly. The proposal would also provide that for continuous haulage systems, temporary ventilation controls
may be used in rooms that are 600 feet or less from the centerline of the entry from which the rooms were developed. In
all other cases permanent stoppings or other permanent ventilation control devices would continue to be required
to separate belt conveyor haulageways from intake air courses when air in the intake air course is used to provide air
to active working places. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b)(4) would continue to require permanent stoppings or other permanent ventilation control
devices ``*&blank;*&blank;* to separate the primary escapeway from belt and trolley haulage entries, as required
by &sect;75.380(g).'' In addition, the proposal would require that when continuous face haulage systems are used,
the loading point for purposes of &sect;75.380(g) would be the inby most point of travel of the dolly. The Agency intends
that this separation be maintained to the most inby point of travel of the dolly in order to provide protection along
the entire length of the conveyor belt entry. A greater or lesser distance for the separation of the conveyor belt structure
from the primary escapeway may be specified and approved in the ventilation plan provided it poses no hazard to miners.
This provision is consistent with the requirements of &sect;75.380(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The portion of the structure necessary to accommodate the movement of the dolly is considered as part of the face haulage
system. Consistent with current MSHA policy, waterlines would not be required to parallel continuous face haulage
systems using a low profile conveyor belt if the length of the belt is less that 600 feet and sufficient fire hose is available
to extend to the working face. Fire suppression devices and signal and alarm systems are not required to be installed
along such conveyor belts. However, the belts considered as face equipment must have fire protection at the belt drive
as required by &sect;75.1100&hyph;2(e) of the existing standard and, if hydraulically operated, must have fire
suppression devices as required by existing &sect;75.1107. Additionally, for safety reasons, check curtains should
not be installed across the area of travel of the dolly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has become aware of questions on the part of a segment of the industry relative to what are acceptable construction
methods and materials for the construction of permanent ventilation controls, excluding seals, that will result
in controls that satisfy the definition of durable given in paragraph (a) of the existing standard. The Agency is addressing
these questions by proposing to eliminate the definition of durable and to modify paragraph (e)(1) to require these
controls to be constructed in a manner and of materials that results in a construction that has been tested and shown
to have a minimum strength of 39 pounds per square foot as tested under ASTM E72&hyph;80 Section 12_Transverse Load-Specimen
Vertical, load only. The proposal retains the intent and requirement of the existing standard because the 8-inch
hollow-core concrete block stopping with mortared joints, to which all other constructions were tied under the definition
of durable in the existing standard, has been tested and shown to have a minimum strength of 39 pounds per square foot.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency recognizes that other construction methods and materials may be available or developed that will result
in permanent ventilation controls that are suitable for the intended purpose. The proposal would permit alternative
constructions for ventilation controls constructed after [INSERT THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS RULE] under paragraph
(e)(1)(i) provided they have been tested and shown to have a minimum strength of 39 pounds per square foot. For a control
to be acceptable, the operator would have to demonstrate that the control has been tested and shown to provide a strength
of 39 pounds per square foot as tested under ASTM E72&hyph;80 Section 12_Transverse Load-Specimen Vertical, load
only. In instances where a construction has already been tested and shown to possess the requisite strength, the operator
need only provide documentation of the test results. MSHA will maintain and will make available for review at each
MSHA District Office a listing of construction methods and materials that have been tested and have demonstrated
a strength of at least 39 pounds per square foot. Persons wishing to have a construction method or material included
in this listing should submit documentation of testing to the Agency. To the extent possible, MSHA will also maintain
a listing of construction methods and materials that have failed to demonstrate a strength of at least 39 pounds per
square foot when tested under ASTM E72&hyph;80 Section 12_Transverse Load-Specimen Vertical, load only. Persons
wishing to have a construction method or material included in this listing should submit documentation of testing
to the Agency. It should be noted that solid concrete block stoppings that are dry-stacked and plastered on only one
side have not been shown to have a minimum strength of at least 39 pounds per square foot when tested under ASTM E72&hyph;80
Section 12_Transverse Load-Specimen Vertical, load only. Unless a stronger plaster is developed, it is unlikely
that a stopping plastered on only one side would be acceptable under the current rule or this proposed revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the existing rule, the proposal would require, in paragraph (e)(1)(ii), that all overcasts, undercasts,
shaft partitions, permanent stoppings, and regulators, installed after November 15, 1992, be constructed of noncombustible
material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also like the existing standard, the proposal lists materials that would be suitable for these controls and would
continue to prohibit ventilation controls installed after November 15, 1992, from being constructed of aluminum.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing a new paragraph (h) to assure that all permanent ventilation controls, including all doors
and seals, regardless of the construction date, be maintained to serve the purpose for which they were built. Existing
&sect;75.333(e)(1) requires that ventilation controls be maintained to serve the purpose for which they were built.
Because existing &sect;75.333(e)(1) also specifies that ventilation controls installed after November 15, 1992,
be constructed of durable and noncombustible material, a commenter questioned whether the maintenance requirement
applied only to ventilation controls constructed after November 15, 1992. That is not the case. Given the importance
of these devices in preserving the integrity of the mine ventilation system, MSHA is proposing the maintenance provision
in a new paragraph to explicitly state that all permanent ventilation controls, including seals, must be maintained
to serve their intended purpose. With regard to seal maintenance, the Agency does not intend that the maintenance
standard would be applied to seals located within another sealed area. Further, the Agency does not intend that the
standard would apply to seals which have become consumed within a gob area which is ventilated and evaluated in a manner
approved through the mine ventilation plan.

Section 75.334&blank;Worked-out Areas and Areas Where Pillars Are Being Recovered
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSHA is proposing to revise paragraph (e) and to repropose existing paragraph (f). A requirement would be added in
paragraph (e) that provides that in addition to designing mining systems so that worked-out areas can be sealed, the
location and sequence of construction of proposed seals would also be specified in the approved ventilation plan.
Improper location and sequencing of seal construction can have a deleterious effect on mine air quality and ventilation
and therefore the location and sequence of construction of these seals should be reviewed and approved as a part of
the ventilation plan. Under the previous standard, the proposed location and sequence of construction of all necessary
mine seals was required to be submitted for approval as part of the sealing plan required by &sect;75.330. Under the
existing standard, the location of proposed seals is required to be shown on the ventilation map required by &sect;75.372.
Showing the location on the map does not subject the location to approval and therefore the Agency agrees that it does
not satisfy the objective of assuring proper location and sequencing. The proposal would rectify this situation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through meetings with various segments of the mining community, the Agency also became aware of a concern that paragraph
(f) of &sect;75.334 may have been promulgated without the benefit of adequate comment. Paragraph (f) addresses mines
with a demonstrated history of spontaneous combustion or those located in coal seams determined to be susceptible
to spontaneous combustion. Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of paragraph (f) of this standard
was done appropriately, it is being reproposed for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent
comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the preamble to the existing standard, several commenters suggested that bleeder systems should
not be required for all mines, stating that in some mines the practice of ventilating worked-out areas increases the
risk of spontaneous combustion by supplying oxygen to combustion-prone materials in these areas. These commenters
requested that the final rule include provisions to address spontaneous combustion. MSHA recognized the need to
reduce the flow of oxygen to areas where there is a likelihood of spontaneous combustion and the existing rule requires
the approved ventilation plan to address spontaneous combustion in mines with a demonstrated history of this hazard
or mines that are located in coal seams determined to be susceptible to spontaneous combustion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Experience gained through application of this standard has demonstrated that paragraph (f) applies to only a few
mines. However, studies by the Bureau of Mines have identified the volatile properties of coal seams and have determined
that certain seams are susceptible to spontaneous combustion. The existing standard, as reproposed, is also directed
to mines in these seams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (f) of the proposal, the approved ventilation plans for mines that are susceptible to spontaneous
combustion must specify measures to detect methane, carbon monoxide, and oxygen concentrations in worked-out areas.
These measures must be taken during and after pillar recovery and in worked-out areas where no pillars have been recovered.
The purpose of these measures is to determine if worked-out areas must be ventilated or sealed. If the methane concentration
or other hazards in the worked-out area cannot be controlled while the mine is limiting airflow to avoid spontaneous
combustion, it may be necessary to ventilate or seal the worked-out area. These measures also help to determine the
extent to which the worked-out areas can be ventilated without increasing the spontaneous combustion hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is concerned with the inability of some mines that have a spontaneous combustion problem to reduce the oxygen
content to a sufficiently low level. It is well known that the oxygen level in a gob varies depending on the location
where the measurement is made. For example, the periphery of a gob normally will have higher oxygen levels than the
interior of the gob. The oxygen level in the interior of the gob is critical when dealing with spontaneous combustion.
If conditions are such that the oxygen content in critical areas within a gob cannot be reduced below that necessary
for a methane ignition to occur, a bleederless system may not be appropriate. The Agency solicits comments on this
subject.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of paragraph (f) the operator is required to specify the action that will be taken to protect miners
from the hazards of spontaneous combustion. This requirement would be triggered if the mine has a demonstrated history
of spontaneous combustion, or, if an evaluation of the susceptibility of the coal seam to spontaneous combustion
leads to a mine operator determination that a bleeder system should not be used. In these cases the approved ventilation
plan must specify the methods that the operator will use to control spontaneous combustion, as well as accumulations
of methane-air mixtures and other gases, dusts, and fumes in the worked-out area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During informational meetings and through the application of this standard, the Agency has become aware that the
conditions under which air flow can be adjusted within a bleeder system is the subject of some concern. The following
discussion is intended to address this concern and clarify the Agency's position. When adjustments to air flow in
the bleeder entries are needed to assure proper functioning of the system, these adjustments would be made in accordance
with &sect;75.324, Intentional changes in the ventilation system. As explained in the preamble discussion of existing
&sect;75.324, when the adjustment in the bleeder system results in a change in direction of the air in the bleeder entry,
this is a change in ventilation that could materially affect the safety or health of miners, and the precautions of
&sect;75.324 apply. As addressed under &sect;75.324, other changes to air flow in the bleeder entry may also materially
affect the safety or health of miners, and the precautions of &sect;75.324 would apply. However, it is not intended
that each and every change to bleeder ventilation be considered to materially affect the safety or health of miners.
For example, minor changes needed to correct a localized condition, such as removing a methane accumulation in a high
spot, may be possible. The operator must evaluate each change prior to its implementation and, if doubt exists as to
whether the change is material, safety dictates that the change be treated as a material change and the provisions
of &sect;75.324 be followed.

Section 75.340&blank;Underground Electrical Installations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSHA proposes to revise paragraph (a) of existing &sect;75.340 for the purpose of clarifying the standard and to add
requirements that a visual and audible alarm be provided on installations utilizing automatically activated doors
and that, for installations equipped with sensors, monitoring of intake air ventilating battery charging stations
be done with sensors not affected by hydrogen. For clarity, requirements for underground electrical installations
to be in either noncombustible structures or areas or to have fire suppression systems have been put into separate
paragraphs. Paragraph (a)(1) sets out the requirements that apply when a noncombustible structure or area is used
for underground electrical installations. Similarly, paragraph (a)(2) sets out the requirements that apply when
a fire suppression system is used. A provision has been added to proposed paragraph (a)(1)(iii) that requires that
electrical installations be equipped with a device to activate a visual and audible alarm located outside of the enclosure
on the intake side of the installation. In addition, to maintain consistency with proposed paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)
and (a)(2)(ii) of this section, proposed paragraph (a)(1)(iii) would be revised to include the provision that monitoring
of intake air ventilating battery charging stations be done with sensors not affected by hydrogen. Proposed paragraph
(a)(1)(iii) addresses installations which are ventilated with intake air and equipped with sensors to monitor for
heat and for carbon monoxide or smoke for the purpose of activating and automatically closing doors. The device would
activate when the temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit or the carbon monoxide concentration reaches 10 parts
per million above the ambient level for the area, or the optical density of smoke reaches 0.05 per meter. The visual
and audible alarm required should be situated so that it can be seen or heard by persons traveling in the intake entry
immediately adjacent to the installation. It was suggested to the Agency that these electrical installations may
be susceptible to fire and the fire could go undetected. The visual and audible alarms would provide additional safety
at these installations.

Section 75.342&blank;Methane Monitors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Informational meetings, later discussions on the rule, and recent experience have indicated that simply requiring
methane monitors to be maintained in permissible condition does not completely satisfy the need for assuring proper
maintenance. It was suggested that it is necessary to have a requirement that a trained person perform maintenance
to preclude the possibility that a person with less than the necessary understanding of the monitor and the permissibility
requirements would be assigned the task. Under the proposal, methane monitors must be properly maintained at all
times. Like the existing rule, proposed paragraph (a)(4) would require that each methane monitor be calibrated with
a known air-methane mixture at least every 31 days. The Agency would expect that, when necessary to maintain permissibility,
methane monitors would be calibrated more frequently. To assure the appropriate level of maintenance, paragraph
(a)(4)(i) would require that this maintenance be done by a trained person. To further assure the adequacy of the maintenance
provided, paragraph (a)(4)(ii) would require, similar to the previous standard, the operator to develop and adopt
a written maintenance program, a copy of which would be made available for review by authorized representatives of
the Secretary and the representative of miners. The investigation into the recent explosion at the No. 3 Mine, Southmountain
Coal Company, Inc., illustrates the importance of proper maintenance of methane monitors and the need for assuring
that maintenance and calibration are being done properly. Although the Southmountain investigation report did
not conclude that the methane monitor on the continuous mining machine was involved in the explosion, it did state
that, ``*&blank;*&blank;* the methane monitor was likely in a condition that would not have allowed for accurate
atmospheric monitoring of the area prior to and at the time of the explosion *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Appendix H of the
report states, ``The methane monitor was not maintained as approved due to the use of a rag in place of the sintered metal
screen filter in the dust guard. The methane monitor was not properly calibrated, as received. If this condition existed
at the time of the explosion, the methane monitor would not have been able to accurately detect the presence of methane.''
The Agency believes that the best way to assure that maintenance and calibration are properly done is through a written
maintenance program with which everyone involved is familiar.

The Agency would expect that, at a minimum, the maintenance program would include the following: (1) Checks to assure
that all components of the methane monitor are securely attached to the machine on which it is mounted and that all packing
glands are properly packed and secured; (2) Checks to assure that the sensor head is installed as close to the face end
of the machine as practicable and that the vent holes and filter(s) on the sensor head are not clogged with water, dust,
or other material; and (3) Checks to assure that the warning device can be seen or heard by the machine operator at all
locations from which the machine is operated and that the lens(es) protecting the meter and indicating lamps is not
cracked or broken. The maintenance program should also make provisions to assure that the methane monitor meter or
readout assembly is properly adjusted to indicate zero percent methane when no methane is present and that it is not
possible to defeat the monitor by holding or blocking the machine's reset switch in the start position. The program
should also specify the procedure for assuring that a warning is given when 1 percent methane is indicated on the meter
or readout assembly and that all motors and lights on the machine are automatically deenergized when 2 percent methane
is indicated on the meter or readout assembly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During informational meetings and subsequent discussions, MSHA heard suggestions that without a requirement for
a record to be maintained of calibration tests, similar to that required by the previous regulation, there would be
no way for the Agency or miners to verify that the tests were made. Upon reconsideration, and in light of the Southmountain
explosion investigation, MSHA agrees that records of calibration tests would be beneficial and is therefore proposing,
in paragraph (a)(4)(iii), that a record of all calibration tests be kept in a book maintained for this purpose on the
surface at the mine. Like other records required by this proposal, the records of methane monitor calibration tests
are to be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. This is being proposed
to reduce the likelihood that pages or records could be lost or misplaced. Comments are solicited on the use of this
type of recordkeeping book and on an alternative approach wherein the Agency would develop, in coordination with
the states, books specific for the required records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of the proposal, the records would be required to be retained for at least 1 year at a surface
location at the mine and be made available for inspection by representative of miners and by authorized representatives
of the Secretary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This standard specifies requirements for compressors in underground coal mines. The proposal would revise paragraph
(a)(1), redesignate existing (b)(2) as (b)(3) and add new (b)(2) and (e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Improperly used or maintained compressors can present a significant risk of fire. To minimize this hazard to miners,
the existing regulation addresses the detection and suppression of compressor fires, and specifies installation
and operation requirements for compressors. The Agency has stayed paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;75.344 of the existing
regulation, which requires all compressors to be located in noncombustible structures or areas. During the informational
meetings, it was brought to MSHA's attention that in some instances requiring such a structure could present a fire
hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal recognizes in paragraph (a)(1) that it is possible to provide the desired level of protection by permitting
compressors to be operated while attended, rather than requiring that they be located in noncombustible structures
or areas. Commenters pointed out that requiring all compressors, including portable compressors, to be located
in noncombustible structures or areas might result in a fire hazard. The primary hazard identified in these instances
is the buildup of heat within the structure if sufficient ventilation for cooling is not provided. Another hazard
identified during discussions on this section is potential delay in roof bolting during construction of a suitable
structure or area for the compressor used for bolting. Recognizing these potential hazards, the proposal would require
compressors to be located in noncombustible structures or areas, provided adequate ventilation is maintained for
cooling or, as an alternative, would require compressors to operate while attended. If the compressor is operated
while attended, it is the Agency's intention that the person be able to see the compressor and recognize a problem and
is close enough to activate the required fire suppression system and assure that the compressor is deenergized or
shut off. This would not preclude the individual from performing other duties, including those involving the use
of the compressor. However, it would require that the individual be in close proximity to the compressor. The Agency
solicits comments on whether the standard should specify a distance and what that appropriate distance would be.
If a specific distance is recommended, the commenters should also provide the rationale for that distance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regardless of whether the compressor is located in a noncombustible structure or area or operated while attended,
existing paragraph (b)(1) requires that the compressor, if not ventilated with air coursed directly into a return
air course or to the surface, be operated only while it can be seen by a person designated by the operator. The difference
between proposed paragraph (a)(1), and the existing paragraph (b)(1) would be the distance the designated person
could be from the compressor. Under proposed paragraph (a)(1) the designated person would be required to be close
enough to activate the fire suppression system, to deenergize or shut off the compressor, and to see the compressor.
Under paragraph (b)(1), the designated person need only be able to see the compressor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments, the Agency is proposing paragraph (b)(2), which provides additional flexibility for compressor
installations while maintaining the same level of protection. Proposed paragraph (b)(2) would add an alternative
that would apply to compressors located immediately adjacent to a return air course where a substantial pressure
differential exists. This alternative would not be appropriate for applications near working sections where low
ventilation pressure differentials exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substantial pressure differentials are necessary to provide the air velocities required to prevent smoke rollback.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed (b)(2), a compressor could be situated adjacent to a return air course, between two permanent ventilation
controls through which an air split would be maintained from a small diameter opening in the intake-side control to
a larger diameter opening in the return-side control. In lieu of the intake-side ventilation control, a door may be
constructed in accordance with &sect;75.333 (d)(1) and (d)(2). Section 75.333(d)(3), which requires doors to be
constructed in pairs, would not apply in this case. The Agency intends that this door remain closed at all times while
the compressor is operating. This door would provide easy access to the compressor. The Agency would continue the
practice of accepting as doors the fire-resistant check curtains described by Steven J. Luzik in ``MSHA Develops
New Fire-Resistant Check Curtains,''

 magazine, pages 102&hyph;104, June 1993. The ventilating air quantity must be adequate to provide the essential
cooling of the compressor. The Agency expects operators to provide the air quantity necessary to assure that the maximum
ambient operating temperature specified by the compressor's manufacturer is not exceeded. Similarly, any other
ventilating or temperature parameters specified by the manufacturer would be considered in determining an adequate
ventilating air quantity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to an air quantity necessary to provide cooling, the air velocity through the intake-side opening would
be required to be sufficient to prevent any air reversal or possible smoke rollback in the event of a compressor fire.
In determining sufficient air velocities, the Agency has placed in the rulemaking record the 1977 MESA Informational
Report, Ventilation to Control the Smoke From a Fireproof Structure, (IR 1054). That report concludes that smoke
rollback should not occur if the centerline velocity through the intake-side opening (not to exceed 16 x 24 inches)
is at least 1,100 feet per minute (fpm) and the discharge opening is not smaller than the intake opening with at least
10 feet between the ventilation controls. The report also indicates that the intake opening should be close to the
floor and the discharge opening should be near the roof. The Agency solicits comments on whether the velocity and associated
parameters outlined in IR 1054 are appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed paragraph (b)(2) alternative also requires sensors for heat or carbon monoxide or smoke to be installed
between the two permanent ventilation controls. The sensors would be required to activate a visual and audible alarm
located outside of the enclosure on the intake side when either condition specified in paragraph (b)(3) (i) or (ii)
occurs. The visual alarm should be situated so that it can be seen by persons traveling in the intake entry immediately
adjacent to the enclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) of the proposal has been added in response to suggestions that compressors have an automatic shutdown
feature that deenergizes or shuts off the compressor when the required fire suppression system is activated. The
Agency recognizes that under &sect;75.1107&hyph;4 automatic deenergization is required if the automatic fire
suppression system is activated on unattended electrically powered compressors. However, paragraph (e) would
clarify that automatic deenergization or shutdown is required for both attended and unattended electric and diesel
powered compressors. This paragraph also would require the compressor to be automatically deenergized or shut off
if one or more of the doors (required by paragraph (b)(3)) close. Historically, fires on compressors that continue
to operate have resulted in oil being released, which has contributed to the severity of the fire. For this reason,
the Agency believes that safety is best served by requiring compressors to be automatically deenergized or shut off
when the fire suppression system is activated.

It was suggested that the cutoff for application of &sect;75.344 be changed from 5 horsepower for all compressors
to 30 horsepower for reciprocating compressors and 5 horsepower for all other types of compressors. The rationale
presented for this suggestion is that reciprocating compressors of up to 30 horsepower contain about the same amount
of lubricating oil as a 5 horsepower oil-flooded rotary compressor. This suggestion is not adopted in the proposal
because the Agency has information (Report No. 06&hyph;292&hyph;87 of the Industrial Safety Division, Pittsburgh
Safety and Health Technology Center) that the predominant hazard for fire or explosion in reciprocating compressors
is not the lubricating oil but rather the formation of carbonaceous deposits in the discharge system. A review of accident
reports indicated that nine mine fires started in compressors between 1970 and 1992. Two of these nine fires occurred
in compressors of the type subject to a buildup of carbonaceous deposits. Although it is not known that this buildup
was the cause of these fires and the compressors involved were larger than 30 HP, these fires are of concern to the Agency.
The Agency solicits additional comments on the safety considerations associated with reciprocating compressors.

Section 75.360&blank;Preshift Examination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSHA is proposing several modifications to the requirements in the existing &sect;75.360, Preshift examinations.
Paragraph (e) would be removed, existing paragraphs (f) through (h) would be redesignated as (e) through (g), paragraphs
(a), (b), (c), and (f) would be revised, and new paragraphs (b)(8) through (b)(10) would be added.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The informational meetings and later discussions on the rule indicated some confusion over the application of preshift
examination requirements to pumpers. The questions focused on the need to preshift examined areas of the mine where
pumpers were scheduled to work or travel. In response to these questions, the Agency has reviewed its position on this
issue and has determined that the interest of safety is best served by permitting pumpers to perform examinations
for themselves, provided they are certified. The existing regulation requires that areas where pumpers are assigned
to work or travel be preshift examined even if the pumper is certified. The proposal would modify &sect;75.360 by requiring
in proposed paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) that certified pumpers perform these examinations if the area has not been
preshift examined. However, if the pumper is not certified, the proposal would continue to require the areas where
the pumper is assigned to work or travel to be preshift examined. Paragraph (a)(2) of the proposal would require that
the pumper make a record by or at the end of the shift of all hazardous conditions found.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with other examinations required by this subpart, no one may accompany the pumper during this examination. If persons
other than the certified pumper are scheduled to enter the area, a preshift examination is required. However, pumpers
may conduct supplemental examinations in accordance with &sect;75.361 for other persons, provided certified pumpers:
(1) have been designated by the operator to conduct these examinations; (2) conduct these examinations within 3 hours
prior to anyone's entering the area; and (3) conduct these examinations in areas where persons were not scheduled
to work prior to the beginning of the preshift examination. The proposal would provide at least the same level of safety
as the existing regulation because a complete examination by a certified person would still be required and the examination
would be conducted closer to the time that miners would actually enter the area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) is proposed for revision to address conditions to be checked by the preshift examiner. Under the existing
rule, the preshift examiner is required to examine for hazardous conditions. The preamble to the existing rule states
the Agency's position that ``Most `hazards' are violations of mandatory standards.'' (57 FR 20894, May 15, 1992.)
It further states that requiring a preshift examiner to look for all violations could distract the examiner from the
more important aspects of the examination and that a district manager could require the preshift examiner to include
examination for other hazards. Upon reconsideration, the Agency is proposing that the preshift examination be expanded
to include an examination for noncompliance with mandatory safety or health standards that could result in a hazardous
condition, as well as other hazardous conditions. This proposal places the examiner and the operator in a proactive
rather than a reactive role and therefore has the potential to enhance safety by identifying a condition before a hazard
exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed paragraph (b)(1), roadways, travelways and track haulageways where persons are scheduled to work
or travel during the oncoming shift must be preshift examined. The proposal would clarify that the preshift examination
includes travelways in addition to roadways and track haulageways. This is being proposed based on comments received
that the terms ``roadways'' and ``track haulageways'' specifically refer to areas where mobile powered equipment
is operated. The addition of the term travelways in the proposal would require areas where persons are scheduled to
travel on foot to also be preshift examined since hazards may also exist in these areas. The remaining portion of the
existing paragraph has been transferred to paragraph (b)(10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b)(3) would require an examination for hazardous conditions and noncompliance with mandatory
safety or health standards that could result in a hazardous condition, tests for oxygen deficiency and methane, and
a determination if the air is moving in its proper direction on any section that is not scheduled to operate but is capable
of producing coal by simply energizing equipment. This is in addition to the existing requirement that these examinations
and tests be made on working sections and areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed. It
has been the Agency's position that sections that are capable of producing coal by simply energizing equipment should
be examined in accordance with &sect;75.361, Supplemental examinations. However, as pointed out by commenters,
a number of fatalities have been the result of persons being sent into areas that should have been examined but were
not. Because there is a reasonable likelihood that miners will at some point during a working shift enter sections
that are set up to mine coal, the Agency is proposing that these sections be preshift examined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has become aware of an opinion of a segment of the mining community that those parts of &sect;75.360 related
to areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed were promulgated without the benefit of
adequate comment. Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of this standard was done appropriately, it
is being reproposed for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the preamble to the existing rule, ``The Agency has always considered these areas to be subject to the requirements
of the preshift examination; however, an investigation following an explosion at the William Station Mine indicated
that some confusion existed on this issue.'' (57 FR 20894, May 15, 1992.) The Agency's position on this issue remains
unchanged at this time; however, comments are specifically solicited relative to the need to preshift examine these
areas.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b)(3) would also require the examination to include a test of the roof, face and rib conditions on these
sections or in these areas. This is to clarify the Agency's position that failures of the roof, face and rib pose a hazard
to miners. It has been suggested to the Agency that specifically requiring this examination is proactive rather than
reactive and is therefore the preferred approach. The Agency has reconsidered its approach and agrees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing paragraph (b)(4) requires that a preshift examination of the approaches to worked-out areas along intake
air courses be conducted if intake air passes by the worked-out area to ventilate working sections where anyone is
scheduled to work during the oncoming shift. The proposal would revise paragraph (b)(4) by also requiring that the
entries used to carry air into these worked-out areas be preshift examined. Under the provisions of existing &sect;75.332(a)(1),
air that ventilates a working section or an area where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed must
be a separate split of intake air. Air that ventilates a worked-out area is return air and cannot be used. The preshift
examination required by proposed paragraph (b)(4) is intended to assure that miners are not exposed to the hazards
associated with ventilating working sections with return air and that air that enters a worked-out area in one entry
does not reenter the intake air course. Additionally, the proposal would clarify the Agency's intent that the examination
of the approaches to these worked-out areas be made immediately inby and outby each entry used to carry air into the
worked-out area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(6) of the proposal addresses concerns raised during the informational meetings and later discussions
on the rule that requiring examination or rehabilitation of rooms and entries described in paragraphs (i) and (ii)
could constitute a hazard. The existing standard requires a preshift examination of entries and rooms driven more
than 20 feet off an intake air course without a crosscut or more than 2 crosscuts off an intake air course without permanent
ventilation controls where intake air passes through or by these entries or rooms to a working section where anyone
is scheduled to work during the oncoming shift. It was pointed out that often these rooms and entries have existed without
incident for many years, which has allowed methane to bleed off. The Agency also heard assertions that as written the
existing regulation may cause a diminution of safety to miners. It was stated that certain areas have been timbered
heavily and cribbed because of adverse roof conditions and that rehabilitating such areas would unnecessarily expose
workers removing or repositioning cribs to hazards. It was also stated that these areas are subject to roof falls and
may remain prone to roof falls and hazardous conditions even after rehabilitation. Finally, it was stated that any
advantages that come from physical inspection of these entries or rooms are outweighed by the danger to which the examiner
may be exposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these concerns, the Agency has proposed that rooms and entries developed prior to November 15, 1992, need
not be preshift examined and requests additional comment as to the impact on safety. Proposed paragraph (b)(6) requires
that entries and rooms developed after November 15, 1992, either be preshift examined or ventilated using permanent
ventilation controls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments, the Agency is proposing in paragraph (b)(8) that the preshift examiner check high spots along
intake air courses where methane is likely to accumulate if equipment may be operated in the air course during the shift.
It has long been recognized by the industry that methane can accumulate in high areas with no indication in the normal
mine entry. As equipment passes under these areas, the methane is pulled down and mixed with the air in the entry and
may be ignited by the equipment. Through proper ventilation and examination, this hazard can be eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During informational meetings, commenters expressed concern about the potential fire and ignition hazards associated
with electrical installations and compressors. Paragraph (b)(9) of the proposed rule would require that electrical
installations referred to in &sect;75.340(a), except for water pumps, and the areas where compressors subject to
&sect;75.344 are located, be preshift examined if the installation or compressor is or will be energized during the
shift. Pumps would be exempted because of the limited hazard presented by pumps and because certified pumpers would
conduct examinations for themselves in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) as they entered the area where the pump is
located. The purpose of examining electrical installations and compressors would be to assure that methane in unacceptable
concentrations is not present in these areas and that there are no signs of fire. The Agency solicits comments on this
proposed requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed rule would modify existing &sect;75.360 to more clearly address those situations where
miners are scheduled to work or travel after the preshift examination has begun. The proposal would amend paragraph
(a), add a new paragraph (b)(10), and make a conforming editorial change to existing &sect;75.360(b)(1). The existing
&sect;75.360(b)(1) requires that a preshift examination include areas where miners are scheduled to work or travel
during the oncoming shift. The proposal reflects the fact that on occasion miners may be given their work assignments,
and thus be scheduled to work or travel in an area, after the preshift examination has begun. This may occur, for example,
due to changing conditions in the mine. In these cases the supplemental examination, rather than the preshift examination,
would be required. In accordance with provisions of &sect;75.361, a certified person must perform an examination
of any area where a preshift examination was not made before any person enters the area. To permit these areas to be examined
other than on the preshift examination maintains the existing level of safety because a complete examination by a
certified person would be required. The examination would be conducted closer to the time that persons will actually
enter the area, and any area where a hazardous condition exists will be posted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the proposed change to paragraph (b)(3) requiring a preshift examination on any section that is not
scheduled to operate but is capable of producing coal by simply energizing equipment, proposed paragraph (c) would
require the preshift examination to include air measurements in these areas. Adequate ventilation is the primary
means for assuring that methane does not accumulate in these areas, and therefore it is necessary to determine that
an adequate volume of air is present. As stated previously, because there is a reasonable likelihood that miners will
enter sections that are set up to mine coal at some point during a working shift, the Agency is proposing that these sections
be preshift examined and that this examination include the air measurements described in proposed paragraph (c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements for the posting of hazardous conditions found during the preshift examination are specified in existing
paragraph (e) of &sect;75.360. They would be transferred to &sect;75.363. Additionally, under the requirements
of proposed &sect;75.363(a), hazardous conditions found by the preshift examiner or the pumper would have to be corrected
immediately. Also, if these conditions create an imminent danger, everyone except those persons referred to in section
104(c) of The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Act) must be withdrawn from the area affected to a safe area
until the hazardous condition is corrected. Only persons designated by the operator to correct or evaluate the conditions
would be permitted to enter the posted area. The requirement that the hazardous condition be corrected immediately
is not intended to require correction by the preshift examiner. To do so would delay the completion of the preshift
examination. Rather, it is intended that the condition be corrected immediately following its reporting by the preshift
examiner. Under the proposal the area would be posted and would remain posted until the hazardous condition is corrected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing paragraph (g) that addresses the record that must be made of the preshift examination would be redesignated
as paragraph (f). Commenters felt that the requirement left no latitude for recording findings of the examiner other
than those listed. The preamble to the existing rule states that the reason for revising recordkeeping requirements
was to ``*&blank;*&blank;* lessen paperwork burden without lessening the protection provided miners.'' This has
not changed. However, commenters indicated that by not permitting examiners to record the results of their examinations,
the protection afforded miners could be lessened. In response to these comments, the Agency is proposing to modify
existing paragraph (g) by reinstating a previous requirement that examiners record the results of the examination.
This would include hazardous conditions and their locations and the results and locations of air and methane measurements.
This is intended to require the preshift examiner to record noncompliance with mandatory standards that could result
in a hazard and observations made during the examination, such as changes in water levels, which, if left unattended,
could block ventilation, resulting in a hazard to miners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would also clarify that the examiner must record the results of methane tests in terms of the percentage
of methane found, as opposed to being characterized by terms such as ``trace.'' Recording a percentage would provide
more precise information for the reviewing officials. The Agency solicits comments on this approach to recording
the results of preshift examinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, proposed paragraph (f) would require that a record be made of the action taken to correct hazardous
conditions found during the preshift examination. Knowledge by mine management of the action necessary to correct
a hazardous condition is important for the proper evaluation of the effectiveness of various actions. For example,
if a hazardous condition occurs repeatedly and the action taken to correct it is the same each time, management should
consider the effectiveness of the corrective action being taken. This requirement is consistent with recordkeeping
requirements found in &sect;75.363 and &sect;75.364. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following publication of the final ventilation rule in May 1992, comments received by the Agency indicated that a
change was perceived in the requirement for ``prompt'' countersigning by the mine foreman or, in the absence of the
mine foreman, by the person designated to perform the duties of the mine foreman. The final rule did not include the
previous requirement that the mine foreman must countersign the report ``promptly.'' Although no change was intended
by the Agency, MSHA is proposing in paragraph (f) that the preshift examination report be countersigned by the mine
foreman by the end of the mine foreman's next scheduled working shift. The Agency intends that the mine foreman, the
person most responsible for the day-to-day operation of the mine, be notified of the information contained in the
reports. Allowing until the end of the mine foreman's next regularly scheduled working shift to countersign the report
would assure that the mine foreman is aware of the results of all preshift examinations and can implement necessary
corrective actions in a timely manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would also require that within two scheduled production days after the mine foreman has countersigned,
the record of the examination be countersigned by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to
whom the mine foreman is directly accountable. This would be similar to the requirement of the previous regulation
that the superintendent countersign records of the preshift examination. The preamble to the existing standard
discusses removing the countersigning requirement by the superintendent on the basis that the superintendent,
in many cases, is not a certified person and the mine foreman is given responsibility for countersigning because the
mine foreman is the person most knowledgeable of the day-to-day operation of the mine. Countersigning by the mine
foreman was retained. However, as indicated during informational meetings and subsequent discussion, the mine
foreman is not necessarily the person in a position to redirect resources to address the safety concern. After reconsidering
the existing language, the Agency is proposing to require countersigning by the mine foreman and by the superintendent,
mine manager, or other official to whom the mine foreman is accountable, to assure that a higher level official, empowered
to redirect resources, is aware of any condition requiring corrective actions. Since this second level official
may not be physically located at the mine on a full-time basis, a period of two scheduled production days is proposed
as a reasonable period of time for countersigning. The Agency solicits comments on this approach to countersigning
the report of the preshift examination.

The proposal would require that the record be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered
pages. Comments are solicited on this approach and on an alternative approach wherein the Agency would develop, in
coordination with the states, books specific for the required records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Identical provisions to those proposed in paragraph (f) of &sect;75.360 for countersigning records and for keeping

MSHA is proposing to redesignate existing (d)(1)(i) and (ii) as (d)(1)(ii) and (iii), revise paragraphs (a)(1),
(c)(1), (d)(1)(iii) and (d)(2), remove paragraph (a)(2), and add new paragraph (a)(2) and (d)(1)(i). MSHA also proposes
to transfer the paragraphs (g) and (h) recordkeeping and retention requirements to &sect;75.363, Hazardous conditions,
posting, correcting, and recording, and add a new paragraph (g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) would be modified in paragraph (a)(1) to require a certified person to conduct an on-shift examination
of a section during any shift when anyone is assigned to work on the section and where mechanized mining equipment is
being installed or removed. The existing rule requires that an on-shift examination be performed only on sections
where coal is produced and where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed. The Agency agrees with
comments received during informational meetings that many of the same hazards can exist for persons working on a section,
regardless of whether coal is being produced. For example, many times miners are assigned to perform maintenance
work on a section when no production is scheduled. This maintenance work can involve disabled equipment that cannot
be moved from the face area or from an area near a pillar line. In these situations, hazards can be equivalent to those
encountered by miners during normal coal-producing operations or similar operations on the section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency proposes to revise paragraph (a) to incorporate the word ``on-shift'' in the first sentence of the paragraph.
The word ``on-shift'' was inserted for clarification and consistency with other paragraphs of &sect;75.362. The
Agency is also proposing to revise paragraph (a)(1) to clarify that sufficient on-shift examinations be conducted
to assure safety. It was suggested to the Agency that MSHA should include language to require more than one examination
if necessary for safety, as provided for in the previous standard. The Agency is adopting this approach and is proposing
that at least once during each shift, or more often if necessary for safety, a certified person designated by the operator
would be required to conduct an on-shift examination of each section where anyone is assigned to work during the shift
and any area where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed during the shift. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has become aware of an opinion of a segment of the mining community that language in paragraphs (a)(1), (c)(1)
and (c)(2) requiring an on-shift examination of areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed
was promulgated without the benefit of adequate comment. Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of this
standard was done appropriately, these paragraphs are being reproposed for the purposes of receiving and giving
consideration to all pertinent comments. The word ``working'' is removed from (c)(1) to assure the application of
the standard would extend to all sections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has determined that a specific examination requirement should be added to assure compliance with the respirable
dust control parameters designated in the mine ventilation plan. Assuring full compliance with these parameters
is important in safeguarding the health of the miners. Agency experience shows that needed attention has not always
been given to the required respirable dust control parameters. Citations issued by the Agency during a special spot
inspection program, undertaken in 1991 at the request of MSHA's Coal Mine Respirable Dust Task Group, in which Agency
inspectors conducted several checks of the dust control parameters during the course of each sampling shift, revealed
that 21 percent of the 781 mining units sampled were not complying with one or more of the parameters. In its 1992 report,
the Agency's Task Group recommended that MSHA ``*&blank;*&blank;* require coal mine operators to make periodic
on-shift examinations to verify that the ventilation plan parameters are in place and functioning as intended''
(p. 47). The Agency agrees and considers on-shift examinations of dust control parameters an important part of reasonable
and prudent dust control strategy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus the proposal, in paragraph (a)(2), would add a new on-shift examination requirement to address respirable dust
control. Under the proposal, at or near the beginning of any shift before coal production begins on a section, a certified
person designated by the operator would conduct an examination for compliance with the dust control parameters established
in the mine ventilation plan. Corrective actions to assure compliance would be required to begin immediately. The
proposed examination would include measurements for compliance with required water pressures and flow rates, number
and orientation of water sprays, air quantities and velocities, section ventilation setup and control device placement,
and any other dust control parameter required in the ventilation plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several methods of measuring water spray pressures would be acceptable. For example, water flow and pressure can
be monitored through the installation of an in-line water meter and a pressure transducer. Water pressure can also
be measured by permanently installing a pressure gauge on a machine. Operators would determine the working relationship
between the pressure gauge reading and the actual operating pressure at the sprays. Once the working relationship
has been established, the gauge pressure could be used to indicate the actual spray pressure specified in the ventilation
plan for a given number of operating sprays.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Measurement of any required water flow rate could be accomplished through the installation of a flowmeter. A flowmeter
provides a direct and reliable measurement and is the preferred method of determining water flow rate. Another acceptable
method of determining flow rate would be to establish the relationship between the water pressure and the spray orifice
diameter, either through engineering data or through actual tests. Once established, the water pressure gauge reading
could be used to reliably indicate a flow rate for a specific number of sprays at a given orifice size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed requirement would specify that the number of water sprays and their orientation be included in the examination.
While spray orientation is important in air-directing spray systems such as sprayfans and shearer-clearers, the
Agency does not intend that precise angles be determined during each examination by the use of engineering instruments.
Rather, the correct direction and orientation of the sprays would be determined by comparison with the requirements
of the ventilation plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed requirement would also specify that the section ventilation setup and control device placement be examined
for compliance with the ventilation plan. Information concerning section ventilation systems is currently required
to be contained in the ventilation plan through &sect;75.371(f). Any other respirable dust control parameters specified
in the approved ventilation plan would be included in the examination under the proposal. An example could be the cleaning
and maintenance procedures for a wet bed scrubber installed on a continuous mining machine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the importance of and the need for continually maintaining compliance with the dust control parameters to assure
dust control, dilution and removal, an effective system of continuous monitoring of the performance and condition
of the dust control parameters is desirable. The Agency is aware that through advances in technology it may be feasible
to monitor air quantity and velocity, and spray water flow rate and pressure. Continuous monitoring offers the potential
to further improve miner protection by providing real-time data on the performance and condition of the dust control
parameters. This information can be used to give early warnings of deteriorating dust control conditions which can
be corrected before the dust control system operates below the accepted standard. Although the application of continuous
monitoring will eliminate the need for periodic physical measurements of key dust control parameters, visual observation
will be necessary to verify compliance with other ventilation plan parameters. Among these are the number and location
of operating water sprays, their general condition and orientation, the section ventilation setup and control device
placement, and other control measures where performance and operating condition can only be assessed visually.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the proposal includes continuous monitoring as an option, the Agency is considering requiring the use of
this technology at some later date when it becomes available. Comments are solicited on this approach. Specifically,
comments are solicited on the parameters that lend themselves to continuous monitoring, the need for performance
standards for monitoring devices, levels of detection, accuracy and precision requirements for monitoring devices,
the need for alarms and/or warning signals when parameters monitored are outside of specified tolerances, and the
polling frequency necessary to provide monitoring that is substantially continuous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1) would be modified to remove the word ``working'' modifying the word ``section'' in the current rule.
The reason for this proposed change is to achieve consistency between paragraphs (a) and (c). Many of the activities
to which persons are assigned would be on sections not normally thought of as working sections, since the term ``working
section'' is often associated with coal production. For purposes of &sect;75.362, a section in the mine is considered
to be the area inby the loading point, or the proposed loading point in the case of the installation of equipment, or
the location of the last established loading point in the case of the removal of mechanized mining equipment. The certified
person conducting the examination would examine the section in much the same way as it would be examined during a coal
producing shift, including checking for hazardous conditions, testing for methane and oxygen deficiency, and determining
if the air is moving in its proper direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) would require certified persons conducting on-shift examinations to take the air measurements at
the same locations where air measurements are required during the preshift examination. This would include areas
where mechanized mining equipment, including longwall or shortwall mining equipment, is being installed or removed.
This provides an additional check of the mine's ventilation system and verifies that ventilation changes in the mine
during the production process have not occurred. Reduced volume or velocity of air during the shift can contribute
to increased levels of respirable dust and the occurrence of methane accumulations or oxygen-deficient atmospheres.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal includes an additional requirement under paragraph (d)(1). The new item appears as (i) while former
(i) and (ii) are redesignated as (ii) and (iii). Paragraph (i) would require that at the start of each shift an examination
for methane be conducted at each working place before electrically operated equipment is energized on the section.
Under the proposal, at the beginning of each shift, a methane examination would be conducted at each working place
prior to energizing equipment. The provision would assure that the working places on the section are examined and
determined to be safe before electrically operated equipment on the section is energized and normal work activities
commence. The operation of electrically powered equipment is a recognized potential methane ignition source. The
proposed rule would reduce the likelihood of ignition by requiring an examination for methane before this equipment
is energized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is also proposing to revise paragraph (d)(1)(iii) to require methane tests more often than at the current
20-minute intervals at specific locations during the operation of equipment in the working place when required in
the approved ventilation plan. Commenters have expressed a concern that some mines, because of the methane liberation
at the face during mining operations, need additional methane tests for safety. MSHA agrees and is proposing to reinsert
language similar to that in the previous standard that would require that when necessary for safety, more frequent
tests are to be made. It should be noted that the methane monitor installed as required by &sect;75.342, Methane monitors,
has never been accepted as a means for satisfying the test requirements of this section, and likewise would not be accepted
under the proposed rule.

It is proposed to modify paragraph (d)(2) to require that methane tests be made at the face of each working place using
extendable probes or other acceptable means. The existing standard requires that these tests be made at the last row
of permanent roof support, unless tests are required to be made closer to the working face using extendable probes.
The previous standard, like the proposal, required these tests to be made at the face. However, it should be noted that
it was a common practice at one time for miners to set temporary support in order to proceed inby permanent support to
make methane tests. Given the hazards associated with advancing inby permanent support for any reason, the Agency
prohibited this practice in the mid 1980's. The use of probes would permit methane tests at the face while continuing
the Agency's policy of prohibiting a person going inby the last permanent roof support to conduct a methane test. Comments
received during informational meetings with the mining community stressed the need for methane tests to be conducted
at the face during any mining operation. MSHA agrees that proper testing for methane at the face is essential for safe
mining operations. Commenters questioned whether methane tests were being conducted adequately during deep cut
operations. Some of the extended cuts currently being taken are up to 40 feet inby the last row of permanent roof supports.
However, the Agency knows of no commercially available probe greater than 30 feet in length. In proposing the use of
extendable probes or other acceptable means to test for methane during deep cut operations, MSHA realizes that the
provision is technology forcing. By requiring methane tests at the face without having miners go inby the last row
of permanent roof support, it is the intent of the Agency to achieve the maximum safety feasible. It is not the intent
of the Agency to prohibit extended or deep cuts that are consistent with technologically feasible safe mining practices.
In the interim, the Agency is soliciting comments on alternative compliance measures that could be acceptable in
lieu of an extendable probe. The other changes proposed in paragraph (d)(2) clarify the location and frequency of
the methane tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would transfer the existing recordkeeping and retention requirements under paragraphs (g) and (h)
to &sect;75.363 Hazardous conditions, posting, correcting, and recording, and add a certification requirement
under a new paragraph (g). The Agency received comments that without certification, no mechanism would exist to verify
that examinations were conducted in belt conveyor entries. In response to these comments, proposed paragraph (g)
would require, similar to a requirement of the previous standard, the on-shift examiner to certify by initials, date,
and time that the belt conveyor entry was examined. The examiner would make this certification at a sufficient number
of locations to indicate that the entire belt conveyor entry has been examined. This certification process is a common
practice in the industry and is required by several state regulations.

Section 75.363&blank;Hazardous Conditions; Posting, Correcting, and Recording
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 75.363 is a new provision included in the proposal in response to comments received by the Agency. The commenters
stressed the importance of recording all hazardous conditions and questioned whether the existing standards require
such a record in all cases. The Agency agrees that recording all hazardous conditions will result in a safety benefit
by assuring notification of the mine foremen and certified persons who may be required to enter the areas to conduct
the examinations. This would enable the examiner to double-check, during subsequent examinations, the areas where
problems have occurred. The proposal would not require a record to be made for those shifts during which no hazardous
conditions were found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;75.363 is intended to apply to all hazardous conditions except for the recording of hazardous conditions
discovered during preshift and weekly examinations governed by &sect;&sect;75.360 and 75.364, respectively and
the action taken to correct these conditions. Section 75.363 would also apply to hazardous conditions found during
the supplemental examination, examinations conducted by pumpers for themselves, and the on-shift examination,
as well as any other hazardous condition. The proposal recognizes that the existing rule already requires the recording
of hazardous conditions found during preshift and weekly examinations. Records completed in accordance with &sect;&sect;75.360
or 75.364 need not be duplicated in the &sect;75.363 records. The Agency believes that records of hazardous conditions
discovered during these examinations would be more appropriately kept in the books maintained exclusively for those
examination results and that no purpose would be served by duplicating those records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) would require any area where a hazardous condition is found by or reported to the mine foreman, assistants
to the mine foreman, or other certified persons designated by the operator to make examinations, to be posted against
entry with a conspicuous danger sign. The danger sign would be placed at a location where anyone entering the area of
the hazardous condition would pass so that persons approaching the area would be expected to see the danger sign. The
posting of areas where hazardous conditions exist to alert persons is an accepted safety practice in the mining community.
The area would remain posted until the hazardous conditions are corrected. As with the existing requirement in &sect;75.364,
Weekly examination, paragraph (a) of the proposal would require that hazardous conditions be corrected immediately
and that only persons designated by the operator to correct or evaluate the condition may enter a posted area. Additionally,
if the hazardous condition creates an imminent danger, everyone must be withdrawn from the affected area to a safe
area until the condition is corrected. Persons referred to in section 104(c) of the Act are permitted to remain in the
area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b) of the proposal would require that once a hazardous condition is found, a record would be required to
be kept in a book maintained for this purpose on the surface at the mine. A description of the hazardous condition, its
location, and actions taken to correct the condition would be recorded. So as to make the information concerning hazardous
conditions available to oncoming shifts, the proposal would require the record to be entered in the book by or at the
end of the shift in which the hazardous condition was discovered. As explained in the preamble to the existing rule,
commenters stated that a record of all hazards found during the examination is necessary to enable the examiner to
double-check, during subsequent examinations, areas where problems have occurred. The Agency agrees with this
position and therefore, consistent with the requirements of &sect;75.360, is proposing in paragraph (b) that a record
be made of any hazardous condition found by or reported to the mine foreman, assistants to the mine foreman, or other
certified person designated by the operator to conduct examinations under this subpart D. Additionally, knowledge
by mine management of the action necessary to correct a hazardous condition is important for the proper evaluation
of the effectiveness of various actions. For example, if a hazardous condition occurs repeatedly and the action taken
to correct it is the same each time, management should reevaluate the effectiveness of the corrective action being
taken. Therefore, the Agency is proposing in paragraph (b) that the record also include the action required to correct
the hazardous condition. Paragraph (b) would not require a record of hazardous conditions found during preshift
or weekly examinations, since the proposed regulations at &sect;&sect;75.360(f) and 75.364(h) would require records
of hazardous conditions found during these examinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assure the accuracy and completeness of the record, paragraph (c) of the proposal would require that the record
be made either by the certified person or by a person designated by the operator. As with other records required by this
subpart, when the record is made by a designated person other than the certified person making the examination, the
person making the record need not be certified. If the record is made by a person designated by the operator, the certified
person would be required to verify the record by initials and date. Paragraph (c) of &sect;75.363 would also include
provisions identical to those proposed in paragraph (f) of &sect;75.360 and paragraph (h) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;75.364 for countersigning records and for keeping the records in a state-approved book or in a bound book with
sequential machine-numbered pages. As discussed above under the section-by-section discussion for &sect;75.360(f),
the requirements for countersigning would increase safety, particularly through increasing the awareness of the
appropriate mine officials of the hazardous conditions requiring correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the requirements for the retention of records in the existing rule, paragraph (d) of the proposal
would require the record to be retained for at least 1 year at a surface location at the mine and be made available for
inspection by the representative of the miners and by authorized representatives of the Secretary. Records of examinations
provide the operator and other interested parties with a history of the types of problems discovered and changes in
the ventilation system that have occurred. In the opinion of the Agency, a 1-year retention period is sufficient to
satisfy this need.

MSHA proposes to revise paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of existing &sect;75.364. Paragraph (a) of the proposal would
modify the requirements addressing the measurements to be made during the weekly examination to evaluate the effectiveness
of bleeder systems and the ventilation of worked-out areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(1) would require that in addition to measuring the methane and oxygen concentrations and
determining if the air is moving in its proper direction in worked-out areas where no pillars have been recovered,
the examiner would measure the air quantity where the air enters and leaves the worked-out area. Paragraph (a)(1)
would also clarify that sufficient oxygen and methane measurements be made to assure adequate air quality. Commenters
suggested, and the Agency agrees, that all of these measurements, including quantity and quality, are essential
to the proper evaluation of the ventilation of the worked-out area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(2) would require that air quantity measurements be made at specific locations in bleeder
entries. These locations include: where air enters the worked-out area, paragraph (a)(2)(i); where air leaves the
worked-out area, paragraph (a)(2)(ii); and, locations specified in the mine ventilation plan to determine the effectiveness
of the bleeder system, paragraph (a)(2)(iii). The proposed measurement of air quantity, as with the currently required
measurement of methane and oxygen and determination that air is traveling in its proper direction, is essential to
the proper evaluation of the effectiveness of a bleeder system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(2)(iv) is intended to provide a mechanism for evaluating the effectiveness of bleeder systems
without traveling the bleeder entries in their entirety. It is anticipated that this alternative will be utilized
in those cases when travel is not possible or when it is not safe to travel the bleeder entries in their entirety. When
elected, the method proposed for evaluation would be required to provide proper evaluation of the effectiveness
of the bleeder system.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following discussion is intended to address comments received relative to weekly examinations for hazardous
conditions to the area of deepest penetration in rooms where no pillars have been recovered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is a common practice in the mining industry to develop rooms off of a set of advancing entries with the return-side
rooms being mined on the advance and intake-side rooms being mined on retreat. Once each set of rooms is developed to
the projected depth, mining is considered completed in that specific area. As each set of rooms is advanced, connections
are normally made between the previously developed rooms and the set of rooms being advanced. The rooms are usually
connected by crosscuts at the point of deepest penetration. Work in these rooms is discontinued as each set of rooms
is completed, creating a worked-out area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters have raised questions concerning the extent of the examination required in these sets of rooms once they
are completed. Also, comments have suggested that in this mining scenario, the area may not be considered worked out
until the final set of intake-side rooms is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency considers rooms and sets of rooms where mining is completed to be worked-out areas. Therefore, a weekly
examination for hazardous conditions by traveling to the area of deepest penetration of the rooms or set of rooms is
required. The required examination includes measurements of oxygen and methane concentrations and tests to determine
if the air is moving in its proper direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the rooms are connected from the first set of return rooms to the point of deepest penetration of the return rooms
with no barriers providing separation, and similarly connected on the intake side, travel around the periphery of
the rooms to the area of deepest penetration and conducting the required air and methane tests will satisfy the requirements
of the section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As provided in existing &sect;75.364(a)(1), an alternate method which provides effective evaluation of the area
may be approved in the ventilation plan. However, approval of an alternate method in lieu of examination at the points
of deepest penetration within a developed area would be unlikely unless the area were penetrated and ventilated by
shafts, bleeder entries, or some other effective method of adequately evaluating ventilation of the area. Comments
are specifically solicited on the issues discussed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been suggested to the Agency that the requirement to evaluate the effectiveness of bleeder systems under paragraph
(a)(2)(iii) can be satisfied by simply traveling the bleeder entries. Since the purpose of traveling bleeder entries
is to evaluate the effectiveness of the bleeder system, this cannot be accomplished by simply traveling the entries.
It is inherent in the requirement that the entries be traveled that the examiner periodically stop at critical locations
to make such tests and measurements as may be necessary to determine that the bleeder system is working effectively.
It would serve no purpose to require that the entries be traveled without an evaluation of the system's effectiveness.
Although the Agency believes that the rule accurately reflects this intent and is not proposing to change the standard
at this time, comments are solicited on this issue. Specifically, the comments should address the need for specifying
where tests and measurements should be made, the nature of these tests and measurements, and whether this information
should be included in the ventilation plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) is proposed for revision to address conditions to be checked by the weekly examiner. Under the existing
rule, the weekly examiner is required to examine for hazardous conditions. The preamble to the existing rule states
the Agency's position that ``Most 'hazards' are violations of mandatory standards.'' As with the preshift examiner,
requiring the weekly examiner to look for all violations could distract the examiner from the more important aspects
of the examination. Nonetheless, the Agency feels there is merit in placing the examiner and the operator in a proactive
rather than a reactive role in terms of identifying hazards. Consistent with proposed &sect;75.360(b), the Agency
is proposing that, similar to the previous standard, the weekly examination include an examination for hazardous
conditions as well as noncompliance with mandatory safety or health standards that could result in a hazardous condition.
The preamble to the existing rule states the Agency's position that ``*&blank;*&blank;* most hazardous conditions
in a mine would result from a violation of a safety or health standard.'' (57 FR 20897, May 15, 1992.) It further states
that requiring the examiner to look for all violations could distract the examiner from the more important aspects
of the examination . Upon reconsideration, the Agency is proposing that the weekly examination be expanded to include
an examination for noncompliance with mandatory safety or health standards that could result in a hazardous condition,
as well as other hazardous conditions. This proposal places the examiner and the operator in a proactive rather than
a reactive role and therefore has the potential to enhance safety by identifying a condition before a hazard exists.

Paragraph (h) of the proposal would require that a record be made of the results of the weekly examination, including
the results of air and methane measurements, either by the certified person or by a person designated by the operator.
The proposal clarifies that the results of methane tests would be recorded as the percentage of methane measured by
the examiner, as opposed to being characterized by terms such as ``trace.'' Recording a percentage would provide
more precise information for the reviewing officials. If the record is made by a person designated by the operator,
the certified person would be required to verify the record by initials and date by or at the end of the shift for which
the examination was made. Paragraph (h) of &sect;75.364 would also include provisions identical to those proposed
in paragraph (f) of &sect;75.360 and paragraph (c) of &sect;75.363 for countersigning records and for keeping the
records in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. As discussed above under
the section-by-section discussion for &sect;75.360 (f), the requirements for countersigning would increase safety,
particularly through increasing the awareness of the appropriate mine officials of the hazardous conditions requiring
correction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSHA is proposing to revise portions of &sect;75.370 to address comments received relative to the role of the representative
of the miners in the ventilation plan approval process. Paragraph (a) would be revised by the proposal, paragraphs
(b) and (e) would be revised and redesignated as paragraphs (c) and (f), a new paragraph (b) would be added, and other
paragraphs would be redesignated as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment received was that the miners who work under the plan are often in the best position to know the effect of proposed
revisions. The Agency has consistently recognized the importance of input from the miners' representative in all
aspects of the plan-approval process. This is clear in the preamble to the existing standard, which states:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
MSHA agrees with commenters that miners have a stake in the implementation of the ventilation plan at each mine. Recognizing
this role and the importance of mine plans to an effective safety and health program, commenters noted that many operators
provide miners with a copy of the proposed plan before it is submitted to MSHA for approval. The commenters also noted
that some existing wage and hour agreements in the industry address this issue, and under these contracts miners have
the right to review plan provisions before they are submitted to MSHA. Also, MSHA district managers meet with miners'
representatives to discuss plan provisions upon request and have accepted written material the miners would like
MSHA to consider while the plan is being reviewed. Related to this issue, miners have the right under &sect;103(g)
of the Act to request an inspection by MSHA of any alleged hazardous condition in the mine. Under the final rule, these
practices and procedures will continue to involve miners' representatives in the development of meaningful and
effective plans.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSHA recognizes that the operator has the legal responsibility for developing a ventilation plan. In that context,
the Agency has reconsidered whether the role of the miners' representative in the plan-approval process should be
formalized in this rule. To clarify the intent of the Agency and to assure that the miners' representative has an opportunity
to comment on each proposed ventilation plan and revision submitted, the Agency is proposing several changes to the
existing standard. As discussed in more detail below, the basic approach proposed is for the miners' representative
to be given the opportunity to review proposed ventilation plans and revisions and submit comments to MSHA. MSHA would
review the plan and consider all timely comments received in making its determination to approve or disapprove a proposed
plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(3)(i) of the proposal would require that at the time of submittal of a ventilation plan or a revision
to an existing ventilation plan to the Agency by the operator, the operator would also be required to provide a copy
of the plan or revision to the representative of miners. This requirement is intended to assure that the miners and
their representative are promptly made aware of what is being submitted and are afforded time to comment. Additionally,
the proposal would continue to require in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) that a copy of the proposed plan or any proposed revisions
be made available for inspection by the representative of the miners. Although this proposal may appear superfluous
in light of the proposed requirement in paragraph (a)(3)(i), it is the Agency's opinion that the review process and
the submittal of comments in a timely manner are facilitated by requiring that the proposed plan or revision be made
available for inspection by the representative of miners as well as providing the representative with a copy. Further,
in those instances where a representative of miners has not been designated, it is necessary that miners have a copy
of the plan available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of the proposal retains the existing requirement that copies of the proposed plan and proposed
revisions be posted on the mine bulletin board and clarifies that posting is required at the time of submittal. The
Agency believes that the posting requirement is necessary to assure that all miners at a mine will have the opportunity
to review the proposed plan or revision and provide input during the review process. The Agency solicits comments
on this approach to providing miners with information relative to proposed ventilation plans and revisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b) of the proposal specifies the means by which the representative of miners would have input to the review
process. Under the proposal, the representative of miners may submit comments on the proposed plan or revision to
the district manager for consideration. Recognizing that in some instances a decision relative to the approval or
denial of a revision must be made in a short timeframe, the proposal would require that comments be made in a timely manner.
The Agency does not define ``timely manner'' but would construe it to be a period of time that would not delay the approval
process. Recognizing the importance of miners' input, the district manager will continue to be available to discuss
with the representative of miners all aspects of the plan as they affect miners' health and safety following approval
or denial of a proposed plan or revision. MSHA solicits comments on this approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1) of the proposed standard would continue the requirement of the existing regulation that the district
manager notify the operator in writing of the approval or denial of a proposed plan or proposed revision. Additionally,
it is proposed in paragraph (c)(1) that a copy of this notification be sent by the district manager to the representative
of miners. This approach is being proposed to assure that the representative of miners is kept informed of the progress
of the plan approval from submission to final action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to assure that the miners themselves, as well as the representative of miners, are aware of the provisions
of the ventilation plan once it is approved, the proposal under paragraph (f)(1) would require that the operator provide
the representative of miners with a copy of the plan or revision following notification of approval. Also, the proposal
would continue in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) the existing requirements that the approved plan or revision be made
available for inspection by the representative of miners and be posted on the mine bulletin board. Under a new requirement
in proposed paragraph (f)(3), an approved plan or revision would be required to be posted within 1 working day of notification
of the approval and would remain posted for the entire period that the plan is in effect.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would revise existing paragraph (b) to add language that reflects the proposed changes in paragraphs

signals. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of &sect;75.312 would require that an operator wishing to use an alternative method
to stopping the main mine fan have the alternative method approved in the ventilation plan.

MSHA proposes to revise paragraph (s) to conform to proposed &sect;75.362(d)(1)(iii). The proposal would delete
the portion of existing &sect;75.362(d)(2) requiring, in the approved ventilation plan, the location of tests which
are to be made closer to the working face than the last permanent roof supports using extendable probes or other acceptable
means. Proposed (d)(1)(iii) would require that the ventilation plan specify the frequency of the methane tests if
required more often than 20 minutes by &sect;75.362(d)(1)(iii). It would also require that the ventilation plan
specify the location of these tests; e.g., ``in the working places on section MMU No. 123,'' or in ``the working places
off first right off of east mains.''

MSHA proposes to revise paragraph (z) to conform to proposed &sect;75.364(a). Paragraph (a) of the proposed &sect;75.364
would modify the requirements addressing the measurements to be made to evaluate the effectiveness of bleeder systems
and the ventilation of worked-out areas during the weekly examination. The measurement of air quantity, as well as
the other measurements required by the existing standard, are essential to the proper evaluation of the ventilation
of the worked-out area and the effectiveness of bleeder systems. It is proposed that the locations where these measurements
will be made or alternative methods of providing these evaluations be included in the ventilation plan.

Existing paragraph (bb) requires that the location of ventilating devices used to control air movement through worked-out
areas be included in the ventilation plan. The proposal would add a requirement contained in the previous regulation,
that the location and sequence of construction of proposed seals also be indicated. Improper sequencing of seal construction
can have a deleterious effect on mine air quality, and therefore the location and sequence of construction of these
seals should be reviewed and approved as a part of the ventilation plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of paragraph (r) of this standard was done appropriately, it is
being reproposed for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent comments. Section 75.325(d),
as reproposed, would require that areas where mechanized mining equipment, including longwall equipment, is being
installed and removed be ventilated. Paragraph (r) of &sect;75.371 would require that the quantity of air that will
be provided be included in the ventilation plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed paragraph (b)(3) would revise existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;75.372(b)(3) to assure that all known adjacent workings are shown on the mine map, regardless of whether they
are located on mine property or on adjacent property. It would do so by deleting the phrase ``on mine property'' from
the existing standard. In response to comments received, the Agency has concluded that it would be inappropriate
to exclude from the mine ventilation map all known workings located in the same coalbed within 1,000 feet of existing
or projected workings simply because they are not located on the mine property. Safety benefits associated with the
knowledge of nearby mine workings accrue, even when the nearby workings are not on the mine property. The Agency also
notes that this revision would be consistent with existing paragraph (h) of &sect;75.1200, Mine map. Paragraph (h)
of &sect;75.1200 requires that the mine map show all adjacent mine workings within 1,000 feet. Like the previous standard,
this revision would assure that all adjacent mine workings appear on the &sect;75.372 map in those cases where operators
do not use a &sect;75.1200 map for their required submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments, the proposed paragraph (b)(19) would reinstate the requirement in the previous standard
that the mine map include the entry height, velocity and direction of the air current at or near the midpoint of each
belt flight where the height and width of the entry are representative of the belt haulage entry. The belt entry is required
to be examined in accordance with subpart D. The proposal would assist the examiner in rapidly determining whether
the air is flowing in its normal velocity and direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the discussion of proposed &sect;75.301, instances have developed where operators take air from
an intake air course to ventilate shops, electrical installations, or for other purposes, and this air is then coursed
to the surface and is not used to ventilate working places. Under one interpretation of the existing definition, because
this air has not ventilated a working place or a worked-out area, the air course cannot be considered a return air course.
In these instances, the proposal would expressly permit the redesignation of the affected portion of the air course
as a return. Because it is important that personnel, including examiners, the miners' representative, and representatives
of the Secretary, know which air courses have been redesignated, the proposal would require that they be shown on the
map. The proposed paragraph (b)(20) would require that the designation and location of air courses that have been
redesignated from intake to return for the purpose of ventilation of structures, areas or installations that are
required by this subpart D to be ventilated to return air courses, and for ventilation of seals, be shown on the map.

This section would revise paragraph (f) and portions of paragraphs (d) and (i) and repropose paragraphs (b)(1) and
(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, &sect;75.380(d)(3) would provide that in areas of mines where escapeways pass through doors
or in areas of mines developed before November 16, 1992, where escapeways pass across or under overcasts or undercasts,
the height of the escapeway may be less than 5 feet provided the height is sufficient to enable miners, including disabled
persons, to escape quickly in an emergency situation. It was brought to the attention of the Agency that in some instances
the removal of roof support or the lowering of the tops of overcasts may be necessary to provide the 5-foot height required
by the existing rule. It has been suggested that this could, in and of itself, result in a diminution of safety. Historically,
the dimensions of escapeways were addressed through criteria. Some mine operators have requested and received approval
for lesser dimensions than that in criteria based on a performance test referred to as a ``stretcher test.'' Under
this test, 4 persons are required to carry a person on a stretcher through the area in question to demonstrate that the
lesser dimension would not delay escape. The Agency would expect that when there is a need to determine whether sufficient
height is provided, the stretcher test discussed above would be applied. Since the goal of the standard is to assure
that the escape of miners is not impeded, the demonstration that there would be no delay assures that there is no reduction
in safety when the proposed standard is compared to the existing standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It was also suggested to the Agency that where escapeways developed on or after November 16, 1992, (the effective date
of the existing rule) pass across or under overcasts or undercasts, the height of the escapeway should be permitted
to be less than 5 feet provided the height is sufficient to enable miners, including disabled persons, to escape quickly
in an emergency situation. The Agency has considered this suggestion but has adopted it because sufficient clearance
should have been provided in these escapeways through proper planning and engineering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency received questions during informational meetings regarding the need for minimum requirements for door
height. The Agency has reviewed its position concerning door heights and is proposing in paragraph (d)(3) to permit
door heights of less than 5 feet under certain conditions. Door heights of less than 5 feet would be permitted provided
the operator demonstrates by the stretcher test described above that persons, including disabled persons, can escape
without delay. Passing this test assures that there would be no diminution of safety under the new provision. Allowing
heights less than 5 feet in these doors is not expected to result in a delay. Normally, there are few doors in an escapeway
and the distance to be traversed in a door is short. Also, since significant pressure differentials can exist in escapeways,
doors which are less than 5 feet would be easier to open. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (d)(4)(i), and (ii) would be unchanged under the proposal, aside from editorial revisions. These paragraphs
are retained to provide for situations where escapeways are permitted to be less than 6 feet in width. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of the proposal would apply to alternate escapeways only. As discussed above, paragraphs
(d)(4)(i) and (ii) permit both escapeways to be less than 6 feet, but not less than 4 feet, in width under certain conditions.
Paragraph (d)(4)(iii) would permit widths less than 4 feet in alternate escapeways when conditions warrant and a
test is conducted to demonstrate the adequacy of the width. The conditions that could warrant lesser widths would
include the locations where the alternate escapeway passes through doors or other permanent ventilation controls
or where supplemental roof support is required. The Agency would expect that when there is a need to determine whether
adequate width is provided, the stretcher test discussed above would be applied. Under this provision, it is conceivable
that escapeway widths less than 4 feet could be warranted by the conditions in the entry through which the escapeway
is routed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has developed proposed paragraph (d)(4)(iii) based on comments received since May 1992 and on its own internal
review. Previously, approval has been requested and granted for reduced horizontal escapeway widths using the above-described
stretcher test. These approvals were based on the need to provide additional roof support and, in some cases, the need
for passage through ventilation controls. Additionally, as newer portions of a mine age and may require additional
roof support, the proposal would allow clearances of less than 4 feet in the alternate escapeway, provided the stretcher
test is passed. The Agency solicits comments as to whether this proposed approach achieves the result of the standard
while adequately addressing the safety issues of providing necessary supplemental roof support in the alternate
escapeway. The Agency also solicits comments on whether the distance that the escapeway is permitted to be less than
4 feet should be limited and if so, what the limit should be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the publication of the existing ventilation rule, some persons interpreted &sect;75.380(d) to require
the width of mobile equipment to be considered when determining compliance with width requirements for escapeways.
It is not the Agency's intent that mobile equipment be considered in this determination unless the equipment has been
permanently abandoned in the escapeway or would be obstructing the escapeway for a significant portion of a shift.
As an example, where a track entry is used as the primary escapeway on a longwall section, material cars would not be
permitted to obstruct the escapeway since the obstruction would exist for long periods of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the informational meetings, a question arose as to the Agency's intent in eliminating the requirement that
escapeways be routed to the ``nearest mine opening.'' It was not the Agency's intent to change this requirement from
the previous standard. The existing requirement that the escapeway follow the most direct route to the surface would,
in fact, require the route to go to the nearest mine opening. However, to eliminate any confusion that may exist, the
proposal would revise paragraph (d)(5) and adopt language similar to that in previous regulation &sect;75.1704&hyph;2(a),
that the escapeway follow the most direct, safe and practical route to the nearest mine opening suitable for the safe
evacuation of miners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of factors affect whether or not the safest, most direct, practical route has been selected. These factors
include roof conditions, travel height, fan location, physical dimensions of the mine opening, and similar considerations.
For example, if bad roof conditions are present along the shortest direct route and those roof conditions are beyond
reasonable control, then an alternate ``safest'' route designated by the mine operator may be appropriate. However,
the presence of roof falls does not necessarily indicate that the passageway would not be suitable for evacuation.
By way of another example, where coal seam thickness varies to the extreme, the shortest route may be through lower
coal, making travel relatively slow and difficult. An alternate route through a high passageway may permit easier
travel. Such an alternate route, although longer, may be acceptable. Similarly, there can be instances where the
``nearest mine opening'' may not be suitable for safe evacuation of miners. For example, an old mine shaft may not be
safe for travel because of badly deteriorated conditions, such as a deteriorated shaft lining or deteriorated timbers,
even though the shaft is still suitable for mine ventilation purposes. A mine shaft developed and equipped with a ventilation
fan prior to the effective date of this regulation may not be suitable for safe evacuation of miners if alterations
were necessary for compliance with new safety regulations that would adversely affect mine ventilation in the event
of an emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the existing standard, mine development projections would not have to be altered to provide additional rooms,
entries, or crosscuts for the sole purpose of providing a passageway to the nearest mine opening. However, the construction
of ventilation controls such as stoppings, overcasts and undercasts, or the installation of an escape facility may
be required to provide the most direct, safe and practical route to the surface.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As with the existing standard, proposed paragraph (f)(1) would require one escapeway that is ventilated with intake
air to be designated as the primary escapeway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed requirement for prohibiting certain equipment from operating in primary escapeways in paragraphs
(f)(3) through (f)(5) would not apply to areas of escapeways where separation of belt and trolley haulage entries
from designated primary escapeways did not exist before November 16, 1992. To require mobile equipment in these areas
of escapeways to be equipped with fire suppression would have no appreciable safety benefit because of the presence
of trolley wires, trolley haulage equipment, and conveyor belts in these escapeways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3) of the proposal would clarify existing requirements by explicitly prohibiting coal haulage in
the primary escapeway. The existing standard permits equipment to be in the escapeway for purposes of hauling miners
and materials and for maintaining the escapeway. The existing standard does not expressly prohibit the haulage of
coal in the primary escapeway. As a matter of clarification of intent, the proposal would specifically prohibit coal
haulage in the primary escapeway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through experience with the existing rule and after considering comments received, the Agency is proposing to extend
the prohibition of certain equipment to other areas of primary escapeways so that the prohibitions would properly
extend to the majority of primary escapeways. The proposal would extend the prohibitions to areas of primary escapeways
developed prior to November 16, 1992 where separation of the escapeway from belt and trolley haulage entries existed
as of November 16, 1992. As with the existing rule, the prohibition would not apply to equipment necessary to maintain
the primary escapeway in safe, travelable condition. The primary escapeways excluded from these prohibitions are
the same as those excluded from the application of &sect;75.380(g), that is, areas of escapeways where separation
of belt and trolley haulage entries from designated primary escapeways did not exist before November 16, 1992. Comments
are solicited on the proposed expansion of the requirements for protecting additional areas of the primary escapeway.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA recognizes the need to protect the primary escapeway and also realizes that different mine designs, the need
to maintain air courses safe for travel, and the need to occasionally move equipment necessitates the operation of
some mobile equipment in the primary escapeway. MSHA would allow certain equipment in the primary escapeway but would
require fire suppression systems on the equipment. Paragraph (f)(3) clarifies that mobile equipment not hauling
coal and the equipment listed in &sect;75.340(b)(1) through (b)(6) may be used in the primary escapeway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike the existing standard, proposed paragraph (f)(4) would permit certain mobile equipment to be protected with
a manual fire suppression system instead of an automatic system, provided it is continuously attended by a person
trained and proficient in the use and operation of the fire suppression system. For the purposes of &sect;75.380(f)
by ``attended,'' the Agency means that the mobile equipment operator would be on the equipment and be capable of responding
immediately in the event of a fire. When a piece of mobile equipment is in the primary escapeway and is properly attended
and equipped with a manual fire suppression system, the equipment operator can immediately respond to the situation,
and the safety afforded by the existing standard is maintained. However, if no one is attending the equipment, an automatic
system would be necessary to protect against fire. Protection is thereby provided against a fire when a machine is
deenergized or shut off. If a machine is solely equipped with a manual fire suppression system, continuous attendance
would be required under the proposal, regardless of whether the machine were operating or shut off, if located in the
primary escapeway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following publication of the existing ventilation rule, some persons construed the requirement for an automatic
fire suppression system to apply to electric face equipment. This was not the intent of the Agency. On November 16,
1992, MSHA issued Program Policy Letter No. P92&hyph;V&hyph;4 addressing the operation and location of equipment
in primary escapeways to clarify the Agency's intent. Under existing regulation, subpart L_Fire Protection, face
equipment is required to be protected by a manual fire suppression system. The proposal recognizes this requirement
and, other than an exception to permit a situation such as the movement of continuous mining machines from section
to section without a continuous water supply, requires that face equipment equipped with a manual fire suppression
system be attended when in the primary escapeway by a person trained and proficient in the proper use and operation
of the manual fire suppression system, providing protection equivalent to automatic fire suppression systems.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed in paragraph (f)(4) that with exceptions for continuous mining machines and as provided in &sect;75.380
(f)(5) and (f)(6) that each piece of mobile equipment in primary escapeways, (1) be equipped with manually operated
fire suppression systems installed in compliance with &sect;75.1107&hyph;3 through &sect;75.1107&hyph;16 and
be attended continuously, or (2) be equipped with an automatic fire suppression system that is capable of both automatic
and manual activation and installed in compliance with &sect;75.1107&hyph;3 through &sect;75.1107&hyph;16.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (f)(5), personnel carriers and small personnel conveyances which are designed and used solely for
transportation of personnel and small hand tools could be operated with a multipurpose dry chemical type automatic
fire suppression system capable of both manual and automatic activation, if the system is suitable for the intended
application and listed or approved by a nationally recognized independent testing laboratory. The proposal recognizes
the small size and limited potential for fire of this particular type of equipment. The types of machinery under paragraph
(f)(5) would not be required to meet the additional requirements of &sect;&sect;75.1107&hyph;3 through 75.1107&hyph;16.
For example, it would be impractical and would not enhance safety to apply the minimum dry chemical poundage requirements
of &sect;75.1107&hyph;9 to small equipment designed and used solely for personnel and small hand tools. Personnel
carriers and small personnel conveyances would be more appropriately protected by fully automatic systems of adequate
capacity which are suitable for the intended application and listed or approved by a nationally recognized independent
testing laboratory.

Commenters suggested that the term ``dry chemical'' would be more appropriate than the term ``dry powder'' used in
the existing standard. The Agency agrees and the proposal would adopt this suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (f)(6), an additional exception is provided for mobile equipment when no persons are inby other than
persons directly engaged in the use or moving of the equipment. The continuous mining machine exception recognizes
that the fire suppression system for the continuous mining machine often relies on a water supply that may be impracticable
to provide during moves. Paragraph (f)(6) is being proposed to permit the necessary movement of face equipment between
sections and to permit the primary escapeway to be properly maintained. Under paragraph (f)(6) of the proposal, mobile
equipment not having a fire suppression system may be in the primary escapeway if no persons are located inby except
those directly engaged in the use of or the moving of such equipment. For example, when moving longwall shields, no
one would be permitted to be inby equipment used to move the shield if this equipment is not provided with a fire suppression
system. With no persons working inby, the use of machinery without a fire suppression system would not expose persons
to the hazard of toxic gases and fumes carried inby. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been suggested to the Agency that certain types of emergency equipment, such as diesel powered ambulances,
should also be exempt from the requirements for fire suppression systems. While the Agency recognizes the potential
benefit that can be attached to the use of this type of equipment, the proposal does not exempt this equipment. Comments
are solicited on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the informational meetings, the Agency became aware of a concern that existing &sect;75.380(i)(2) would
permit slopes of significant length and inclination to exist without any mechanical escape facilities. An example
used is a slope of 900 feet inclined at 18 degrees from the horizontal. It was suggested that such a slope could be particularly
difficult for passage of injured persons under cold and icy conditions if mechanical escape facilities were not provided.
In light of this concern, the Agency has reconsidered its position and is proposing in paragraph (i)(2) that any slope
that is part of a designated escapeway and is inclined more than 9 degrees from the horizontal be provided with mechanical
escape facilities. The Agency solicits comments on this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following promulgation of the standard, the Agency received comments that the final rule language should have retained
the proposed rule language relative to ventilation of the primary and alternate escapeways with separate splits
of intake air. As discussed in the preamble to the existing standard, this issue, along with several other issues,
was referred to an advisory committee appointed by the Secretary of Labor. The advisory committee has submitted its
final report to the Secretary for review and appropriate action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.380(b)(1) of the existing standard requires escapeways to be provided from each working section. A working
section is defined in &sect;75.2 as beginning at the underground loading point. The proposal would continue the practice
of permitting mines which have not established a loading point to haul coal with mobile equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Providing escapeways during the installation and removal of mechanized mining equipment is necessary to provide
safe escape for miners from hazards that may develop during these phases of the mining operations. Although the Agency
believes that the promulgation of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this standard was done appropriately, they are
being reproposed for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent comments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with current requirements in subpart O_Hoisting and Mantrips, three new paragraphs are proposed under
&sect;75.382. Paragraph (g) would require the designated examiner to certify by date, time, and initials that the
mechanical escape facilities examination required by paragraph (c) was performed. The proposal would require that
the certification appear at or near the facility examined. Certification has long been an accepted practice in the
mining industry for assuring that concerned individuals can readily determine that a required examination has been
completed. In the case of mechanical escape facilities, if certification is not provided, precious time could be
lost as the escape facility is tested prior to use. The certification proposed will provide the operator or the person
using the facility with assurance that the facility is safe to use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h) would require that a record be made of the examination performed in accordance with paragraph (c). The
results of the examination would be included in the record, including any deficiency found along with the corrective
actions taken to correct the condition. The intent is that deficiencies be documented and that both the mine foreman
and superintendent, or other appropriate official be made aware of any problems, assuring that follow-up and corrective
action will be taken. As with other records required by the existing rule and this proposal, the record of the examination
of mechanical escape facilities provides valuable information to both the miners and the operator. The record not
only indicates that the examination has been completed but also provides historical information on the nature of
deficiencies found during the examination and the type of corrective action required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The examiner would be permitted to complete the record immediately following the end of the shift in which the examination
was performed. The record would be countersigned by the mine foreman by the end of the mine foreman's next regularly
scheduled working shift. During an absence of the mine foreman, the person acting as mine foreman would countersign.
The Agency intends that the mine foreman, the person most responsible for day-to-day operation of the mine, be notified
of the information contained in the reports. Allowing until the end of the mine foreman's next regularly scheduled
working shift to countersign the report would assure that the mine foreman is aware of the results of the examination
and would enable corrective actions to be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h) would also require that within two scheduled production days thereafter, the record of the examination
be countersigned by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to whom the mine foreman is directly
accountable. The intent is to assure that a higher-level official, empowered to redirect resources, be aware of any
condition requiring corrective actions. Since this second-level official may not be physically located at the mine
on a full-time basis, 2 scheduled production days are proposed as a reasonable period of time for countersigning.

As with other records required by this proposal, proposed paragraph (i) would require that these records be retained

parties with a history of the types of problems discovered and the types of corrective actions required. In the opinion
of the Agency, a 1-year retention period is sufficient to satisfy this need.

Existing paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) deal with the escapeway map and drill requirements in areas where mechanized mining
equipment is being installed or removed. Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of paragraphs (a) and
(b)(1) of this standard was done appropriately, as with other provisions dealing with the installation and removal
of mechanized mining equipment, they are being reproposed for the purposes of receiving and giving consideration
to all pertinent comments. The Agency believes that for areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed
or removed, providing escapeways and posting maps identifying these escapeways and conducting drills specified
in the standard are essential to maintain safety. These requirements help to assure that miners are familiar with
escape routes so that, should escape become necessary, they can reach the surface as quickly as possible.

Section 75.384&blank;Longwall and Shortwall Travelways 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Existing &sect;75.384 addresses the requirements for a travelway on the tailgate side of a longwall or shortwall,
the location and marking of the travelway, and procedures during a blockage of the travelway. While the Agency has
received comments suggesting that additional involvement by the miners would be of benefit when a roof fall or other
blockage occurs that prevents travel in the tailgate travelway, no changes are proposed to &sect;75.384 at the present
time. The Agency believes that the existing procedures and regulations appropriately address the hazards and provide
a sufficient opportunity for input and involvement for all interested parties. The following discussion reviews
the appropriate procedures and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general procedures to be followed when such a blockage occurs are specified in &sect;75.384(c). The standard
requires that work on the face must cease, miners must be withdrawn, and MSHA must be notified. The standard also prohibits
work on the face until the procedures set out in &sect;&sect;75.215 and 75.222 are implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.215 requires that the approved roof control plan specify the procedures that will be followed if a ground
failure prevents travel out of the section through the tailgate side of the longwall. In this regard, &sect;75.222(g)(2),
the roof control plan, would address notification of the miners, re-instruction of the miners regarding escapeways
and escape procedures, re-instruction of the miners on the availability and use of self-contained self-rescue devices,
monitoring and evaluation of air; location and effectiveness of communication, and a means of transportation from
the section. All approved roof control and ventilation plans and revisions must be available to the miners according
to current regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District managers historically have met with and will continue to meet with interested parties to discuss plans under
review or previously approved. As plans are developed, reviewed, and approved, MSHA considers written comments
from all interested parties. Additionally, the Act entitles a representative of the miners to accompany an MSHA representative
conducting an inspection or investigation as a result of the &sect;75.384(c)(3) notification to MSHA of a blocked
travelway. Finally, under &sect;103(g) of the Act, miners are entitled to request an inspection by MSHA.

Section 75.388&blank;Boreholes in Advance of Mining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing to revise &sect;75.388(c) to require rib holes to be drilled in one or both ribs of advancing
working places described in &sect;75.388(a) ``as may be necessary for adequate protection of miners in such working
places.'' The present standard requires that boreholes be drilled in at least one rib of advancing working places
described in &sect;75.388(a). Although no change was intended by the Agency in promulgating the current language,
comments indicate that the previous language was more specific and clearer to the mining community. The Agency is
therefore proposing to adopt language similar to the previous regulation.

Section 75.389&blank;Mining Into Inaccessible Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 75.389(c) addresses the special case where mining operations mine through into areas where hazards and potential
hazards may be unknown. During the informational meetings and later discussions, it became apparent that differing
interpretations of the application of this provision existed. To clarify the intent of the Agency, the proposal would
revise existing &sect;75.389(c) by adding an exception for routine mining-through operations that are a part of
a retreat mining system approved in the mine ventilation plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some circumstances, the mining through occurs during routine mining into an area which is covered by an approved
ventilation plan. In this case, the potential hazards have already been addressed in the ventilation plan. The Agency
believes that the requirements set out in &sect;75.389(c) should not apply in this situation and proposes an exception
to these requirements where the mining-through operations are part of a retreat mining system approved in the mine
ventilation plan and are routine operations. Requiring the operator to submit duplicate plans does not result in
any safety benefit; therefore, the level of safety provided by the existing standard is maintained.

V. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Executive Order 12866 MSHA prepared a preliminary impact analysis (PRIA) to estimate the potential
costs and benefits associated with the proposed revisions to the ventilation rule. Based upon the available data,
MSHA has determined in its PRIA that this rule would neither result in major cost increases nor have an effect of $100
million or more on the economy. A copy of the PRIA is available from the MSHA docket office and is summarized as follows.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In assessing costs and benefits of the ventilation rule, it is important to note that ventilation of underground coal
mines is the primary method of preventing the accumulation of explosive methane gas, controlling harmful respirable
dust, and assuring the quality of air miners breath. Because of the potential for a large number of fatalities resulting
from ventilation problems, MSHA has found it prudent to establish multiple safety factors and safety work practices
to better assure adequate protection for miners. It is extremely difficult to specifically quantify safety benefits
related to each safety factor. However, due to the close, confined nature of the workplace in an underground coal mine,
failure of any safety factors or protective actions related to ventilation can have disastrous effects. In 1984,
a fire starting from an over heated compressor at the Wilberg Mine resulted in 27 deaths. More recently, an explosion
at the William Station Mine in 1989 resulted in 10 deaths and exposed other miners to high concentrations of carbon
monoxide and smoke. In the restricted work environment of an underground coal mine, failure of a single safety factor
or noncompliance with a safe work practice could jeopardize the well-being of all miners underground. The total effect
of the provisions in this proposed rule in conjunction with MSHA's existing ventilation standards should decrease
the occurrence of fatalities, injuries, accidents, and illnesses in underground coal mines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to this proposed rule, the Agency has identified nine fatalities and seven injuries which potentially
could have been prevented by compliance with these proposed provisions. In addition, the proposal contains provisions
to better assure compliance with the respirable dust control parameters specified in the mine ventilation plan.
Adherence to these parameters helps to maintain a work environment free of excessive levels of respirable dust, thereby
improving long-term health protection for miners and potentially reducing the number of miners afflicted with coal
workers' pneumoconiosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some proposed provisions clarify the intent of the current rule. Such clarifications should increase the likelihood
of compliance and thereby would help to increase the probability of preventing a fatality, injury, or non-injury
accident. For the proposed provisions which would offer an alternative compliance option, the miners would be provided
at least the same level of safety provided by an existing requirement. These provisions would facilitate compliance
by the operator, thereby increasing the potential for the rule to reduce the probability of a ventilation-related
explosion or accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, the Agency determined that these proposed provisions would increase the probability that compliance
with the ventilation rule would prevent future ventilation-related accidents and generate a safer mining environment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSHA has compared the costs associated with the existing requirements with the costs of the proposed requirements.
For the purpose of estimating the incremental compliance cost increases or decreases, these proposed provisions
have been divided into three categories, each category requiring a slightly different approach in estimating the
costs of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first category includes those proposed provisions which retain or clarify requirements specified in the existing
rule. For this category, there would be no additional costs of compliance if these were estimated in the RIA to the May
1992 rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second category includes those proposed provisions that would provide a mine operator with an alternative compliance
option to an existing requirement (for example, allowing a miner to continuously attend an operating compressor
instead of requiring the compressor to be located in a noncombustible structure). For this category, the availability
of an alternative compliance option can affect the level of compliance, depending on the alternative selected. Thus,
the availability of an alternative compliance option could reduce the costs of compliance for some mine operators.
However, the potential compliance cost savings depend upon whether the operator selects the alternative compliance
option. MSHA believes that the operator's decision would depend on factors that may vary widely among mines, therefore,
MSHA estimated a percentage of mines likely to use a specific option and based its projected cost savings on these estimates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third category includes those proposed provisions that would impose new requirements (for example, requiring
an automatic shut down feature on a mobile compressor when the fire suppression system is activated). For this category,
the potential incremental compliance costs were estimated by using full compliance with the existing rule or existing
industry practices as the baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the available data, MSHA estimated that compliance with the proposed rule would cost the mining industry
$3.8 million in first-year costs, or about $826,500 in annualized costs. Net annual compliance costs would be about
$7.6 million. The total of annualized plus annual costs is projected to be about $8.4 million. In addition to these
incremental costs, during the first year of compliance with the new air quality requirements under &sect;75.321,
it is possible that two large mines may lose a block of coal, resulting in approximately $6 million in lost production
to these mines.

Executive Order 12866 requires that regulatory agencies assess the impact to the government for any regulation determined
to be a significant regulatory action. MSHA does not believe that the proposed rule will create any significant cost
impacts to the government. The proposed regulation can be implemented under existing government practices without
any substantial equipment or facility expenditures by the government.

The proposed ventilation rule would have a minimal impact upon labor productivity, profits, prices, mining output,
and mining employment in underground coal mines. However, there is the potential that some individual mines may incur
significant compliance costs associated with several provisions. First, some mines may be affected by the provision
that would establish the minimum oxygen level and maximum carbon dioxide level for the air in bleeder entries and worked-out
areas where persons work or travel. In order to obtain a complete and accurate cost of this proposed requirement, MSHA
is requesting data on the number of mines that would encounter an air quality problem where a miner would be required
to work or travel, the types of actions needed for compliance, and the expected incremental costs of these actions.
Second, mines with deep cut sections would likely have difficulty conducting methane measurements at the face. Therefore,
MSHA is requesting data on alternative compliance measures for deep cut mining operations. Finally, mines may experience
some difficulty reconfiguring operations to address requirements concerning equipment in primary escapeways.

Regulatory Flexibility Certification

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that agencies evaluate and include, wherever possible, compliance alternatives
that minimize any adverse impact on small businesses when developing regulatory standards. MSHA has not exempted
small mines from any provision of the proposed rule and small mines would benefit from some of the proposed provisions
and the proposed alternative compliance methods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA determined that these proposed revisions would not generate a substantial cost increase for small mines. The
lack of a substantial cost increase for small mines, in conjunction with the fact that similar hazards exist in both
large and small mining operations, indicates that regulatory relief is not warranted for small mining operations.
Therefore, MSHA has determined that these proposed provisions would not have a significantly adverse impact upon
a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incremental costs for small and large mines are listed by provision in Table II.

(c) At least every 31 days, the automatic fan signal device for each main mine fan shall be tested by stopping the fan.
Notwithstanding the provisions of &sect;75.311, underground power may remain energized during this test. If the
fan is not restarted within 15 minutes, underground power shall be deenergized and no one shall enter any underground
area of the mine, except as provided in this paragraph below, until the fan is restarted and an examination of the mine
is conducted as described in &sect;75.360 (b) through (e) and the mine has been determined to be safe. Only persons
necessary to evaluate the effect of the fan stoppage or restart, or to perform maintenance or repair work that cannot
otherwise be made while the fan is operating, shall be permitted underground. An alternative test that does not require
stopping the fan may be used provided it provides the same level of assurance that the fan signal will function as intended
during fan stoppages and the alternative method is approved in the ventilation plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) At least every 31 days, the automatic closing doors in multiple main mine fan systems shall be tested by stopping
the fan. Notwithstanding the provisions of &sect;75.311, underground power may remain energized during this test.
If the fan is not restarted within 15 minutes, underground power shall be deenergized and no one shall enter any underground
area of the mine, except as provided in this section, until the fan is restarted and an examination of the mine is conducted
as described in &sect;75.360 (b) through (e) and the mine has been determined to be safe. Only persons necessary to
evaluate the effect of the fan stoppage or restart, or to perform maintenance or repair work that cannot otherwise
be made while the fan is operating, shall be permitted underground. An alternative test that does not require stopping
the fan may be used, provided it provides the same level of assurance that the automatic closing doors will function
as intended during fan stoppages and the alternative method is approved in the ventilation plan.
