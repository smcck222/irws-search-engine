SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the Farm Credit Administration Board (Board), amends the regulations relating
to the components of permanent capital for Farm Credit System (Farm Credit or System) banks and associations. The
objective of these regulations is to implement amendments to the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (1971 Act) made by the Farm
Credit Banks and Associations Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (1992 Act). The effect of the regulations is to establish
requirements for the agreement between a Farm Credit Bank (FCB) and its related direct lender associations specifying
where the earnings held by the FCB and allocated to associations may be counted as permanent capital, to specify how
these earnings would be counted in the absence of an agreement, to provide a date certain for the exclusion from capital
of payments by Farm Credit institutions to the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation (FAC) made in
connection with the repayment of Treasury-paid interest, and to make other conforming changes to implement the statutory
amendments. Technical and conforming changes are made throughout the agency's regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 15, 1993, the FCA Board proposed amendments to its regulations that would implement the changes set forth by
the 1992 Act. (See 58 FR 34004, June 23, 1993.) The FCA received comments in response to these proposed regulations
from The Farm Credit Council on behalf of its membership and the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, two
Farm Credit Banks (FCBs), a Farm Credit association, and a state bankers' association. These comments were fully
considered by the FCA in drafting the final regulations. The comments and the FCA's response to the comments are discussed
below, along with an explanation of any material changes made to the proposed regulations. In addition, technical
and clarifying changes to language of the proposed regulations have been made in the final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter asserted that some of the proposed regulations, particularly &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(A) through
(C) and (E), inject the FCA into the decision making process of the banks and associations as they attempt to develop
agreements that will best fit their business needs. The proposed regulations cited by the commenter pertain to the
time period of the allocation agreement, the effective date, the prohibition on amendments more often than annually
without FCA approval, and the automatic 1-year extension if neither party objects. As is explained in more detail
below, the regulatory requirements were proposed primarily for safety and soundness reasons but also provided for
the administrative convenience of the System institutions and the FCA. The FCA also attempted to provide a framework
that would permit negotiation between banks and associations on an equitable basis. The final regulations contain
modifications to the proposed regulations, including certain deletions of provisions pertaining to administrative
convenience, to the extent the FCA believes appropriate without compromising safety and soundness and fairness
principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter asserted that the underlying impact of the proposed regulations was to provide greater flexibility to
the FCBs in competing with private sector lenders and criticized this as contrary to the public good and inconsistent
with the objective of reducing Government's role in the free market. The FCA disagrees. The proposed regulations
do not augment the statutory authority of the FCBs. The ``greater flexibility'' in allocating capital is provided
by the statute and is not expanded by the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter stated a belief that the intent of the 1992 Act amendment to section 4.3A(a)(1)(B) of the 1971 Act was to
require FCBs and associations to enter into allocation agreements. The FCA disagrees that the law mandates allocation
agreements and does not believe it is appropriate or feasible to promulgate a regulation forcing nonagreeing associations
and FCBs to enter into agreements. In the event that there is no agreement, the allocation formula provides an orderly
way of determining which institution will count the allocated investment, or any part of it, as permanent capital.

II. Specific Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 615.5201(a)_Definition of ``Allocated Investment'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requested clarification that allocated earnings ``retained by the bank'' means ``not paid in cash.''
This was the intended meaning of the regulation, consistent with the statutory language. The FCA has added clarifying
language in the final regulation.

Section 615.5201(j)(6)_Definition of ``Permanent Capital'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter encouraged the FCA to provide guidelines in the regulations by which the financial assistance provided
by the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (FCSIC) would be counted as permanent capital. In addition, the commenter
asserted that the nature of the security, and not the holder of the security, should be the determinant in counting
capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA does not believe it necessary or useful to set forth in the regulations guidelines to be followed by the FCA in
determining how it would count assistance provided by the FCSIC. Since the FCA does not know what form FCSIC assistance
may take, it is impossible to determine at this time whether the assistance would qualify as permanent capital. Moreover,
the FCA disagrees with the comment that the FCSIC should be treated the same as any other security holder in determining
whether FCSIC assistance is permanent capital. The role of the FCSIC as a provider of financial assistance to System
institutions is statutory and unique. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 615.5210(d)_Counting of Treasury-Paid Interest as Permanent Capital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter stated a belief that the preamble description of proposed &sect;615.5210(d) was inconsistent with the
text of the proposed regulation, in that the preamble indicated that only assessments passed on directly to associations
would be added back to the association's capital (and would not be added back to the bank's capital). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of calculating the permanent capital ratio, it was not the FCA's intention to differentiate between
assessments directly passed on to the associations and assessments passed on ``indirectly (through loan pricing
or otherwise)'' as provided by the statute. Congress apparently contemplated that there would be three possible
ways of paying the cost of assessments: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The FCB would not directly or indirectly pass on the cost, even though the ultimate effect would be felt by the associations;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The FCB would assess associations directly for an amount based on proportionate average accruing retail loan
volumes of the associations for the preceding year; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The bank would indirectly assess associations by adjusting the interest rate on the direct loan or some other method
based on proportionate average accruing retail loan volumes of each association for the preceding year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The difference between method 1 and method 3 is that the ultimate effect of method 1 on an association is in proportion
to the amount of its investment in the bank or its direct loan, whereas method 3's ``cost'' is based on average accruing
retail loan volumes. Changes have been made in the final regulations to clarify that, when an FCB directly assesses
an association (method 2), or when it indirectly assesses an association by specifically identifying the assessment
in other charges made by the FCB to the association (method 3), the amount of the assessment is added back to the capital
of the association (and not to the capital of the bank). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this connection, it is the FCA's view that, while the regulations do not require an FCB to enter into an agreement
with its direct lender associations that would specify whether and how assessments would be passed through, there
are important advantages in having a written understanding. This would clearly document the understandings and
expectations of all parties and would provide more certainty to all parties for business planning and capital building
purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter asked how the amount of assessments passed indirectly to an association is to be reported in the Call Reports
of the institution. The instructions to the Call Reports specify how this is to be done.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter recommended that the references to ``a percentage allotment'' of the allocated investment be changed
to a ``percentage or other allotment.'' Such a change would, for example, enable an FCB to count the allocated investment
up to a specific percentage of the association's direct loan from the bank. Alternatively, the bank may wish to count
a specified dollar amount of the investment. The FCA believes that an allotment based on a specific dollar amount would
be appropriate but does not believe that the allotment should be tied to floating factors such as the direct loan amount.
The permanent capital ratio is used as one of the key determinants of a Farm Credit institution's financial health
and stability. Allowing permanent capital to move frequently based on floating measures, such as loan volume outstanding,
diminishes the permanent capital ratio's usefulness as a financial measure. If the allotment is left to float, it
could change daily, beyond the control of management. This may not be appropriate during stressful periods in some
institutions.

 Accordingly, the final regulation has been revised to permit only an allocation based on a dollar amount and/or a percentage
of the allocated investment. The amount of allocated investment could be determined based on a dollar amount, and
any earnings that may be distributed could be allotted on a percentage basis. The FCA believes that this permits adequate
flexibility.

Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(C)_Amendments to Allocation Agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters objected to the restrictions in the proposed regulations that would prohibit the reallotment of
the association's investment in the FCB more often than annually without the FCA's approval. While one commenter
acknowledged that the FCA may have a legitimate regulatory concern in curbing the potential abuse of amendments to
manipulate capital ratios, the commenter asserted that FCA prior approval is an inappropriate means of addressing
the concern. In the commenter's view, a prior approval is inconsistent with the FCA's role as an arm's-length regulator,
and without specific criteria for granting approval the FCA could become involved in the business decisions of the
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA has reexamined the proposed prior approval procedure and has determined that it would be appropriate to replace
it with a provision enumerating specific circumstances in which a reallotment may be made. Therefore, the final regulations
permit only annual amendments to the allocation agreement, except in the event of a reorganization or merger, or when
a reallotment is required to enable the FCB to make payments in connection with the Capital Preservation Agreements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA strongly believes that the more frequently an allocated investment ``moves'' in the computation of the permanent
capital ratio, the less reliable the permanent capital ratio is as an indicator of the financial soundness of an institution
or of trends in the institution's operations. Consequently, one of the most important uses of the minimum permanent
capital standard would be eliminated if institutions were permitted to change their allotments frequently and at
will. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other than in the context of a merger or other corporate reorganization of one of the parties, when a reallotment would
likely be necessary, or when a reallotment is necessary to enable the FCB to make payments in connection with the Capital
Preservation Agreements, the FCA is aware of only a limited number of situations in which there would be any incentive
for the institutions to reallot capital. For example, as part of its examinations, the FCA makes evaluations of the
capital adequacy of each institution. The FCA is concerned that, if a reallotment is permitted as often as desired,
it would be permissible to reallot capital in the time period between the examination of an FCB and an affiliated association
for the benefit of the institution to be examined next. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, since the lending limit of an institution is based on the amount of its permanent capital, it would also be
permissible to temporarily reallot capital to enable an institution to make a loan that would otherwise be in excess
of its lending limits. Similarly, an institution could reallot capital in order to retire stock that it would otherwise
be unable to retire, or even attempt to forestall an enforcement action by the FCA based on insufficient permanent
capital. Although these matters could be viewed by institutions as ``internal business decisions,'' they raise
safety and soundness and other issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, as a policy matter, the FCA views frequent changes in where the capital is counted as undesirable. The
FCA believes that it is more efficacious to prevent the possibility of manipulation by regulation rather than to examine
institutions to determine, after the fact, if such manipulation of their capital has occurred.

Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(A)_Effective Date of Allocation Agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(A) provided that all of the allocation agreements would become effective at
the start of the second quarter of each year. A commenter stated that there was no need for delay in implementing the
agreement and noted that many districts currently implement the agreement on a calendar year basis. The commenter
also stated the opinion that the effective date of these agreements is a procedural matter that ought to be left to the
discretion of the parties and should be controlled by the business needs and planning processes of the affected institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The date proposed by the regulations was set, for the convenience of the parties, as the quarter following the allocation
of earnings from the FCBs to associations so that the actual dollar amount of the allocation would be known when the
allotment was being determined. In addition, setting a specific date would have facilitated the FCA's oversight
of institutions. However, upon reconsideration, the FCA believes that the requirement to file a copy of the agreement
with the responsible FCA examination field office will be sufficient to enable the agency to fulfill its oversight
responsibilities. The final regulations permit banks and associations to select any date as the effective date of
their agreement, provided that such date is no less than 12 months after the effective date of the existing agreement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(D) required an allocation agreement to be sent to the FCA and any nonparty associations
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, associations that were not parties to that allocation agreement) in the district within 3 days after the agreement
was signed. A commenter asked that the time period be increased from 3 days to 20 business days, stating that this would
enable a district with many associations to submit all of the agreements in one mailing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA has reconsidered the proposal and has determined that a more flexible filing requirement would be less burdensome
to the banks and associations, without compromising the FCA's ability to monitor the capital strength of the institutions.
The final regulation deletes the 3-day FCA filing requirement and provides, instead, that a certified copy of the
agreement must be filed with the appropriate FCA field office on or before the effective date of the agreement, and
that copies of agreements must be sent to other associations in the district within 30 calendar days of signing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter requested assurance that the allocation agreement could consist of a contract, an exchange of board resolutions,
or an incorporation of the terms of the agreement into the business plans of the institutions. The commenter is correct
that any of the means described would be appropriate.

Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(E)_Notification to the FCA of Objection to the Extension of an Allocation Agreement

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(E) provided that the allocation agreement would be automatically extended
for another year if not amended and if neither party to the agreement notifies the FCA of its objection to the continuation
of the agreement at least 30 days before the expiration date. A commenter suggested that the notification to the FCA
be made in writing. The FCA agrees that this notification should be made in writing, and the final regulations include
this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also stated that the agreement itself should govern such matters as termination and extension rather
than the regulations. The FCA has considered this comment and agrees in principle that the bank and association should
be free to provide in their agreement for such matters as termination and extension. However, the FCA also believes
that it is appropriate to provide for an automatic extension of the agreement if the matter has not been addressed in
the agreement. The final regulations reflect this change.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter asked for clarification of whether permanent capital ratios for the default allocation formula would
be computed in proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(F) using a 3-month average daily balance, as the regulations
otherwise require for permanent capital ratio computations. The ratios would be computed in the same manner in this
circumstance, using a 3-month average daily balance, and the final regulations contain this clarification. The
regulations further provide that the permanent capital computations must be calculated as of the expiration date
of the existing agreement.

Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(G)_Reallotment in Connection With Payments Relating to Capital Preservation Agreements

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(G) required a bank and one or more associations to amend their agreement in order
to reallot the allocated investment if such reallotment would enable the FCB to make its Capital Preservation Agreement
annuity payment and still meet minimum permanent capital standards. However, it did not specify a basis to determine
which associations must amend their agreements. A commenter recommended that the regulations require that the allocation
agreements provide for such reallotment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA agrees with the commenter and believes that this issue would be appropriately provided for in the allocation
agreements as suggested. The final regulations include a provision requiring the issue to be addressed in the allocation
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter recommended that, in addition to the preferred stock that System institutions are presently authorized
to issue, subordinated notes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediate-term preferred stock be allowed to be counted as permanent capital. The commenter suggested that such
issues be limited to 25 percent of total capital so that an institution would not be able to rely principally on this
source. Another commenter expressed an opinion that the use of debt instruments as a substitute for capital would
undermine the safety and soundness of the System and, therefore, opposed that part of the proposal. Yet another commenter
stated that debt securities should be included in permanent capital if they are counted on a discounted or sinking
fund basis. These proposals are still under consideration by the FCA and will be addressed in future proposed regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA has deleted from the definition of permanent capital the reference to preferred stock issued to the FAC, since
all such stock has now been retired. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed regulations inadvertently eliminated a provision of existing &sect;615.5210(d)(3)
regarding investments made in connection with loan participations. That provision states that, where an institution
invests in another institution to capitalize a participation interest, the investing institution must deduct from
its total capital an amount equal to its investment in the participating institution. The proposed regulations addressed
situations where an institution invested in a bank for any purpose, including to capitalize a loan participation,
but did not address any situation where a bank or association invested in another association (to capitalize a loan
participation or for any other purpose). The provision from the existing regulations has been revised to apply only
to investments in associations and restored as &sect;615.5210(e)(5) in the final regulations, and the succeeding
paragraphs have been renumbered accordingly. Furthermore, proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(3) has been revised and
a new paragraph (e)(4) has been added to clarify that all earnings allocated by a bank to a recipient will count as permanent
capital of the bank in the absence of an allocation agreement, except when the bank is a Farm Credit Bank or agricultural
credit bank and the recipient is a Farm Credit association, in which case the default allotment formula would apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, these regulations include amendments to parts 607, 614, 615 (subpart E), and 620 of the regulations. These
changes, as more fully described below, are conforming and clarifying changes to provisions containing references
to existing capital regulations that are now covered by various provisions of new &sect;&sect;615.5201 and 615.5210(d),
(e), and (f). The FCA has determined that the notice and comment requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (c) do not apply
in this situation. Notice and public procedure thereon are unnecessary because the amendments are not substantive
in nature and do not impose new requirements. Therefore, there is no reason to solicit public comments on them. Accordingly,
the FCA finds that good cause exists to promulgate final amendments to these provisions without notice and comment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conforming changes have been made to the capital regulation references in &sect;614.4351(a) to account primarily
for the renumbering of paragraphs. The references to revised paragraph (e) (2), (3), and (4) of &sect;615.5210, replace
the reference to paragraph (d)(2) of that section in the existing regulations. While the methodology in amended &sect;614.4351(a)
for computing an institution's lending limit base will be somewhat different, and in some cases more complicated,
because of the amendments to the capital regulations, the effect will be the same.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 To facilitate institutions' understanding and interpretation of the lending limit calculation, the language describing
the calculation has been clarified regarding the sequence of the adjustments and regarding which institution will
count the investment in question in its lending limit base. We note, in this connection, that the ``investment'' includes
any equities that are purchased as well as equities that are allocated in a distribution of earnings on participations.
The FCA is considering how the calculation might be simplified and will publish for comment any proposed substantive
changes that may be appropriate.

In other words, the revised &sect;614.4351(a) will continue to require that an investment held to capitalize a loan
participation interest sold to another institution will be included in the lending limit base of the institution
that holds the investment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

regulations relating to the elimination of certain investments for the purpose of calculating a limit on bankers
acceptances for a bank for cooperatives, the actual referenced language has been inserted as an aid to the reader.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, the conforming amendments in &sect;&sect;607.2, 615.5131(t), and 620.1(j) have been made to reflect the
renumbering of existing capital provisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) On or before the effective date of the agreement, a certified copy of the agreement, and any amendments thereto,
shall be sent to the field office of the Farm Credit Administration responsible for examining the institution. A copy
shall also be sent within 30 calendar days of adoption to the bank's other affiliated associations.

with which there is no agreement (nonagreeing associations), and shall not be applied to the allocated investments
held by those associations with which the bank has an agreement (agreeing associations):

needed by the bank, the allocated investment of each nonagreeing association shall be multiplied by a fraction whose
numerator is the amount of capital needed by the bank and whose denominator is the total amount of allocated investments
of the nonagreeing associations, and such amount shall be allotted to the bank. Next, if the permanent capital ratio
of any nonagreeing association is less than 7 percent, a sufficient amount of unallotted allocated investment shall
then be allotted to each nonagreeing association, as necessary, to increase its permanent capital ratio to 7 percent,

(G) If a payment or part of a payment to the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation pursuant to section
6.9(e)(3)(D)(ii) of the Act would cause a bank to fall below its minimum permanent capital requirement, the bank and
one or more associations shall amend their allocation agreements to increase the allotment of the allocated investment
to the bank sufficiently to enable the bank to make the payment to the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation,
provided that the associations would continue to meet their minimum permanent capital requirement. In the case of
a nonagreeing association, the Farm Credit Administration may require a revision of the allotment sufficient to
enable the bank to make the payment to the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation, provided that the
association would continue to meet its minimum permanent capital requirement. The Farm Credit Administration Board
may, at the request of one or more of the institutions affected, waive the requirements of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(G)
if the Board deems it is in the overall best interest of the institutions affected.

(3) A Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank and a recipient, other than an association, of allocated earnings
from such bank may enter into an agreement specifying a dollar amount and/or percentage allotment of the recipient's

of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, except that, in the absence of an agreement, the allocated investment shall be
allotted 100 percent to the allocating bank and 0 percent to the recipient. All equities of the bank that are purchased
by a recipient shall be considered as permanent capital of the issuing bank.

(4) A bank for cooperatives and a recipient of allocated earnings from such bank may enter into an agreement specifying
a dollar amount and/or percentage allotment of the recipient's allocated earnings in the bank between the bank and

percent to the recipient. All equities of a bank that are purchased by a recipient shall be considered as permanent

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the Farm Credit Administration Board (Board), adopts a final rule concerning
director and senior officer compensation. The regulation amends the director compensation regulations to reflect
changes to the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (Act) made by the Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety and Soundness Act
of 1992 (1992 Amendments),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 and amends the annual report disclosure rules for director reimbursable expenses to address concerns raised by Farm
Credit banks regarding the equity and regulatory burden of the existing rule. Additionally, the rule amends the disclosure
requirements for senior officer compensation to make the disclosures more informative and useful to shareholders.

1. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA published a proposed rule concerning director and senior officer compensation and reimbursable expense
disclosures on December 23, 1993 (58 FR 68069). The comment period closed January 24, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 611.400, concerning bank director compensation, is adopted substantially as proposed with the exception
that the cap on the amount by which the FCA Board would consider waiving the statutory limitation on bank director compensation
for exceptional circumstances has been increased from 25 to 30 percent. Section 618.8270, regarding the reimbursement
of travel, subsistence, and related expenses, has been modified by reducing several of the policy and procedure requirements
originally proposed. The final rule retains the requirement that each Farm Credit System (FCS or System) institution
develop a written policy regarding the reimbursement of travel, subsistence, and other related expenses to its directors,
officers, and employees and provide stockholders with a brief description of the policy. Substantial changes have
been made to the proposed senior officer compensation disclosure requirements in &sect;620.5(i)(2). The final
rule requires FCS institutions to disclose: (1) Individual compensation information of chief executive officers
(CEOs) whose annualized salary and bonus exceed $150,000, adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price
Index (CPI); and (2) aggregate compensation information of all senior officers as a group. Both the CEO and aggregate
senior officer compensation information is required to be reported for each of the last 3 fiscal years and presented
in a Summary Compensation Table. The final rule retains the requirement that the institutions provide a discussion
of compensation plans. Finally, a provision was added to allow associations the option of disclosing senior officer
compensation information in either the Association Annual Meeting Information Statement or the annual report.

II. Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA received 140 comment letters from the Farm Credit Council (FCC) on behalf of its membership, 7 Farm Credit Banks,
3 Banks for Cooperatives, 122 associations, and 7 shareholders. Commenters expressed strong opposition to the proposed
disclosure of individual compensation information for each of the five most highly paid senior officers. The following
discussion focuses on the FCA response to commenters' concerns regarding the proposed senior officer disclosures
as this was the predominant issue raised in their letters. The section-by-section discussion also addresses other
comments received on the proposed rule.

A. Basis for Senior Officer Compensation Disclosures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters stated that FCS institutions are not parallel to commercial banks or thrifts, or analogous to other Government-sponsored
enterprises (GSEs). Therefore, commenters adamantly believe that FCS institutions should not be required to make
similar executive compensation disclosures. Commenters stressed four main points in support of their position.
First, the compensation disclosure requirements for commercial banks, national banks, thrift institutions, and
state member banks are applicable only to financial institutions subject to the registration requirements of section
12(b) or (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Second, equity securities in FCS institutions are owned only by borrowing members of the institutions, not purchased
primarily for investment, and not publicly traded. Thus, the investor concerns addressed by the 1934 Act are not present
in the case of FCS institutions. Third, although formally exempt from the registration requirements of the 1934 Act,
other GSEs report as if they were subject to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) statutes, in part, because their
securities are subject to the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. Fourth, the disclosures provide
limited benefits to investors in FCS debt obligations because the banks are jointly and severally liable on these
obligations. Consequently, investors generally rely on the strength of the System as a whole. Rather, commenters
contend it would be more appropriate, in their judgment, for the FCA to compare the treatment of FCS institutions under
the proposed rule to Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and credit unions, as the ownership structures of those entities
more closely parallel those of the FCS banks and direct lender associations. Unlike commercial banks and thrifts,
credit unions and FHLBs are not subject to executive compensation disclosures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Public companies with at least 500 shareholders of record and assets of at least $5,000,000 must register with the
SEC pursuant to SEC regulations implementing the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA agrees with commenters that a comparison of ownership structures between FCS institutions and credit unions
and FHLBs has some validity, and that FCS institutions are notably different from commercial banks, thrifts and other
GSEs. Nevertheless, the FCA did not intend to imply or draw a direct parallel between FCS institutions and any other
type of financial institution or to use a comparison between the institutions as the sole basis for establishing or
modifying the senior officer compensation disclosure requirements. The primary comparison being made was that
the FCA's proposed compensation disclosure requirements were similar in many respects to those imposed on commercial
banks and thrifts by other regulators. As stated in the proposed rule, the FCA believes that more detailed compensation
disclosures, such as those imposed by the SEC, would satisfy the objectives of section 514 of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and the proposed disclosures would benefit FCS shareholders by providing them with senior officer compensation
information that was comparable to that available to shareholders of other financial institutions. The proposed
disclosure requirements were still, however, markedly less extensive than those established by the SEC, partly
due to the many differences between commercial banks and FCS institutions. The final regulations deviate further
from the SEC's compensation disclosure requirements in consideration of the uniqueness of the FCS institutions.
For example, the $100,000 compensation threshold established by the SEC for individual senior officer compensation
disclosure was one area where the FCA chose to differ. Instead, the FCA decided to adopt a $150,000 compensation disclosure
threshold that applies only to FCS institution CEOs.

The stated objective of section 514 is ``to ensure that information reported by directors, officers, and employees
of Farm Credit System institutions under regulations of the Farm Credit Administration requiring the disclosure
of financial information and reporting of potential conflicts of interests_(1) provides the stockholders of all
Farm Credit System institutions with information to assist the stockholders in making informed decisions regarding
the operations of the institutions; (2) provides investors and potential investors with information necessary
to make investment decisions regarding Farm Credit System obligations or institutions; and (3) provides the Farm
Credit Administration with information necessary to allow the Farm Credit Administration to effectively and efficiently
examine and regulate all Farm Credit System institutions and thus enhance the safety and soundness of the System.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA's rationale for requiring director and senior officer compensation disclosures stems primarily from the
``at-risk'' nature of the stock and the significant number and wide distribution of shareholders, which are similar
attributes to those of financial institutions with publicly traded stock. In terms of assets, the size of many FCS
institutions is comparable to, and sometimes greater than, financial institutions whose equity and debt securities
are widely held by the public. In addition, even if commenters are correct in their assertion that investors of FCS
debt obligations are more concerned with the System as a whole, the FCA believes that the investor concerns addressed
by the 1934 Act are not completely absent as suggested by commenters. Regardless of their motivation for purchasing
the stock, borrowers make a financial investment in FCS institutions and obtain the right to participate in the affairs
of those institutions. Shareholders can potentially benefit from their investment in terms of dividends and patronage
refunds. Thus, shareholders need sufficient information to make intelligent decisions about the management and
operation of the institutions in which they have invested and to hold directors and management accountable for their
actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA stated in the preamble to the shareholder disclosure regulations published on June 12, 1986 (51 FR 21337) that
while not all FCS institutions would meet the test for public companies, many of them have in excess of 500 shareholders,
and the number of institutions with fewer than 500 shareholders continues to decline in conjunction with the trend
toward mergers. Further, the FCA stated that while the stock is not publicly traded on the secondary market, it is held
by over 900,000 individuals and business entities that have a common interest in the financial and operating information
of the institutions. The FCA Board continues to believe that the distinction between holding stock for investment
and holding stock for doing business with an institution does not have a material bearing on the right of shareholders
to have access to information in order to make informed decisions. Therefore, the final compensation disclosure
requirements continue to place CEOs of FCS institutions with a significant amount of assets and number of shareholders
under the same scrutiny as CEOs of financial institutions with publicly traded stock subject to the registration
requirements of the 1934 Act.

B. Section 514 of the 1992 Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA agrees with the commenters that section 514 is quite broad and its interpretation, as it applies to compensation
disclosures, is a matter of the FCA's discretion. Commenters stated that nothing in section 514 of the 1992 Amendments
compels the disclosure of individualized senior officer compensation or concludes that the current disclosure
requirements are inadequate in any respect. They felt strongly that the existing disclosure of senior officer compensation
in the aggregate, coupled with the requirement that shareholders may request the individual compensation of any
senior officer, or any other individual included in the aggregate whose compensation exceeds $50,000, was adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was no intention in the proposed rule to suggest that section 514 mandates individual disclosure of senior officer
compensation. In section 514, Congress stressed the importance of disclosure of compensation paid to, loans made
to, and transactions made with FCS institutions by directors and senior officers of the institution. Congress also
directed the FCA to review its regulations to ensure that they meet the purpose of the section and applicable laws,
but did not prescribe any specific regulation amendments. After reviewing its regulations, the FCA concluded that
more detailed senior officer compensation disclosures satisfied the spirit and intent of section 514.

C. Board Accountability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters expressed concern that providing individual compensation information would undermine the board's
authority and its ability to effectively administer the institution's salary administration program. Further,
commenters asserted that the disclosure rule would dilute the board's responsibility and shift the oversight responsibility
from the board of directors to the shareholders as a whole.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA Board disagrees that disclosure of information undermines board accountability and responsibility. In
fact, disclosure of senior officer compensation is intended to promote board accountability to shareholders rather
than shift board responsibility to shareholders. The objective of this type of disclosure is to provide shareholders
with information to assess whether senior officer compensation is appropriate in view of the institution's financial
condition and performance and to hold the board accountable for maintaining a reasonable rationale for the level
of compensation paid to its senior officers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Invasion of Privacy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although numerous reasons were cited in opposition to individualized compensation disclosure, no other issue generated
the intense reaction created by concerns of ``invasion of privacy.'' Respondents were highly concerned that the
disclosure of potentially sensitive information in a public format, such as the annual report, would cause considerable
staff dissension and would render management unable to effectively administer the institutions' salary programs.
One commenter stated that disclosure of the individual salaries of the five highest paid senior officers will, more
than likely, cause salaries to gravitate to the highest paid levels in order to maintain morale rather than ``limit''
compensation paid to senior officers. Several commenters expressed concern that the disclosures may cause employee
flight. Additionally, some FCS associations were concerned that the individual compensation disclosures may inadvertently
reach the branch officer level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA recognizes that internal conflict may be generated when the information presented is used by parties for purposes
for which they were not intended, such as a means for co-workers to compare salaries or to use as a bargaining tool for
salary negotiations. The FCA also believes, however, that management is ultimately responsible for maintaining
employee morale and retaining competent staff through fair and reasonable compensation, and for communicating
to staff how this is accomplished through the salary administration program. A primary aspect of the disclosures
is to provide shareholders insight regarding the methodology and basis the boards use to determine what they consider
to be ``fair and reasonable'' compensation, rather than to ``limit'' senior officer compensation as suggested by
a commenter. Further, the FCA believes stockholders have valid reasons to have this type of information readily available
to them and they should not be penalized because of the potential for internal conflicts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters were opposed to the proposed disclosures because FCS institution annual reports are used as marketing
tools, among other things, and made available to a wide spectrum of interested parties. Some commenters believed
that the broad distribution of the reports could promote animosity among shareholders and employees throughout
the FCS and possibly other members of rural communities. Several commenters also stated that in order to evaluate
the reasonableness of individual senior officer compensation, shareholders would need to understand several key
aspects of the employer/employee relationship, such as the experience and knowledge an employee brings to his/her
job, geographical cost-of-living data, market compensation for similar positions, job responsibilities, and
the competitive and regulatory environment in which the employee operates. Commenters also asserted that providing
just a dollar amount of compensation, without any other relevant data, would be interpreted by the readers of the annual
report in terms of their own frame of reference. This could easily lead to confusion and ill feelings among employees
and shareholders because they are not provided with all the facts involved in determining an individual's compensation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FCA disagrees that shareholders would be unable to understand and assess the senior officer compensation disclosures.
In addition to reporting ``dollar amounts'' of compensation paid, institutions are required to provide a discussion
of the compensation plans to aid the reader's understanding of the disclosures. Moreover, nothing in the regulations
prevents an institution from providing explanations of the market or any other factors used in the determination
of compensation. Management always has the discretion to provide such explanations if they feel they are needed to
fairly portray the amounts being paid to senior officers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA Board recognizes that it should, to the extent possible, balance shareholders' needs to receive meaningful
information concerning their institutions and individual privacy concerns. As expressed in the FCA Board's Policy
Statement on Regulatory Philosophy, ``The FCA Board is mindful that most regulatory activities will involve competing
considerations and is committed to considering and weighing those competing considerations and arriving at thoughtful
regulatory judgments''. (Published June 22, 1994 at 59 FR 32189) Therefore, in reaching a balance between the competing
considerations regarding the proposed regulation, substantial modifications were made to the senior officer disclosure
requirements and are more fully explained in the section-by-section discussion.

III. Section-by-Section Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Section 611.400_Compensation of Bank Board Members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters generally expressed support for proposed &sect;611.400, Bank Director Compensation. The FCC stated
that the proposed procedure for adjusting the bank directors' compensation ceiling and the approval process for
exceeding the statutory limitation in ``exceptional circumstances'' seemed to be both fair and well-considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA is adopting the amendments to &sect;611.400 as proposed with two modifications. The proposed rule included
a 25-percent cap on the amount by which the FCA Board would approve a waiver of the statutory limitation on bank director
compensation. The FCA received two requests for waivers of the statutory limitation since publishing the proposed
rule. Based on its operational experience in reviewing those requests, the FCA Board determined that a 30-percent
cap on the amount by which it would approve waivers of the statutory limitation would be more appropriate. In addition,
the requirement in proposed &sect;611.400(c)(3) that the FCA respond to requests for waivers of the statutory limitation
within 30 days was modified by extending the agency's self-imposed response time to 60 days. The FCA will respond to
requests for waivers as quickly as possible and anticipates replying to the vast majority of requests in well under
60 days. Nevertheless, there may be unusual circumstances that would necessitate a longer period to gather and analyze
pertinent information related to the request, and the longer response period should reduce the frequency of formal
extensions of the response period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA recognizes the difficulty in predicting all the exceptional circumstances under which a bank may desire to
seek a waiver of the statutory limitation on bank director compensation. Therefore, the FCA would like to clarify
that &sect;611.400(d)(3), pertaining to a bank's policy on bank director compensation, need only address exceptional
circumstances that the bank's board is able to identify. The policy should also include a procedure for evaluating,
on a case-by-case basis, other extraordinary circumstances that may arise where the bank's board would consider
seeking a waiver of the limitation.

B. Section 618.8270_Travel, Subsistence, and Other Related Expenses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters generally supported proposed &sect;618.8270, but challenged whether the level of detail in policy and
procedure requirements was necessary. The FCC commended the FCA Board for its openmindedness and willingness to
reconsider the existing requirement for individual disclosure of bank director reimbursable expenses and replace
it with an aggregate disclosure requirement. The FCC and other commenters stated that while it is quite appropriate
for the FCA to require each FCS institution's board to develop written policies concerning the reimbursement of travel,
subsistence, and other related expenses, the details of such policies should be left to each board's discretion.
In their judgment, the degree of detail spelled out in proposed &sect;618.8270(a) constitutes micro-management,
which they believed the current FCA Board was seeking to remove from the regulations. Another commenter responded
that the administrative burden created by the detailed policy requirements, documentation, reporting, and auditing
is not supported by the value, if any, that would be added to the stockholder disclosure process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In February 1994, subsequent to publication of the proposed regulations, the FCA Board adopted the previously mentioned
Policy Statement on Regulatory Philosophy (59 FR 32189, June 22, 1994) that stated ``It is the FCA Board's philosophy
to promulgate regulations that are necessary to implement the law and to promote the safety and soundness of the Farm
Credit System.'' One method cited for achieving the FCA Board's regulatory objective was to issue regulations, to
the extent feasible, that specify performance criteria and objectives rather than operational methods for achieving
its purposes. In light of this recently adopted position, the FCA reevaluated proposed &sect;618.8270 and made modifications
accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The examples of guidelines and limitations that an institution may consider addressing in their travel policy (i.e.,
modes of transportation; mileage rates for use of personal vehicles and per diem allowances, including maximum or
limitations on lodging, meals and incidental expenses; and telephone calls and any other miscellaneous expenses)
were eliminated from the final rule. The examples cited in proposed &sect;618.8270(a)(2)(i) through (iv) were removed
because many commenters interpreted them as mandatory regulatory requirements. However, the FCA Board continues
to believe that the management of each FCS institution should determine to what extent the individual items cited
as sample guidelines and limitations in the proposed rule are necessary to ensure that the reimbursement of expenses
for directors, officers, and employees is reasonable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well-justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain aspects of proposed &sect;618.8270 that incorporated, in part, procedures from existing &sect;611.400(b)
and (c) were eliminated from the final rule. The FCA Board believes that such detailed operating procedures should
remain at the discretion of each FCS institution's management rather than be formally prescribed by regulations.
Therefore, all of the procedures in proposed &sect;618.8270(a)(3) and (4) were removed and the basic requirement
for maintaining written records of expense reimbursements was assimilated into final &sect;618.8270(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended that the last sentence in &sect;618.8270(b) referring to ``the personnel authorized
to process reimbursements,'' be amended by substituting ``approve'' for ``process.'' The commenter asserted that
the persons who normally process reimbursements are accounting clerks, and stated that it is not usually part of their
function to attempt to determine whether expenses are appropriate. In an effort to clarify the regulation, the last
sentence was stricken from the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters misinterpreted proposed &sect;618.8270(c) to require that an internal auditor review every expense
claim and record. The FCA has clarified that the regulation only requires an internal auditor to determine whether
the institution's policies and procedures are being consistently followed by testing the reimbursement process
through a sampling of expense claims and records. The final rule reads that ``Each board shall require a review by the
institution's internal auditor (or person designated by the board) of at least a sampling of records maintained *&blank;*&blank;*.''
Furthermore, the requirement for an internal audit review of travel records is now contained in &sect;618.8270(b)
in the final rule.

C. Section 620.5(i)_Compensation of Directors and Senior Officers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Director compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The disclosure requirements in the final regulation remain unchanged from the proposed regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Senior officer compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The senior officer compensation disclosure requirements were substantially changed in the final regulation. As
previously discussed, the modifications were made because the FCA Board considered it important to balance commenters'
privacy concerns with the shareholders' need for access to pertinent information regarding their institutions,
and to further reflect the unique attributes of FCS institutions in the regulations. In addition, technical and clarifying
changes were made to improve the understanding of the requirements and enhance the consistency of the disclosures
presented to shareholders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An alternative means for associations to disseminate senior officer compensation information was added to the final
rule. Many commenters asserted that the disclosure of compensation information is more appropriate for a proxy statement.
To address this issue, final &sect;620.5(i)(2) permits associations to disclose senior officer compensation information
in either the Association Annual Meeting Information Statement (AAMIS) or the annual report. By allowing associations
to disclose compensation information in the AAMIS, the FCA Board aims to reduce the concern of wide distribution of
potentially sensitive information in a public format. Currently, there is no other disclosure medium for banks that
serves a similar purpose as the AAMIS. Thus, the banks would continue to publish senior officer compensation in the
annual report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule limits the requirement for disclosure of individual compensation information to FCS institution
CEOs. Proposed &sect;620.5(i)(2)(i), which would have required institutions to make individual compensation
disclosure for each of the five highest compensated senior officers, was dropped from the final rule. Final &sect;620.5(i)(2)(i)(A)
requires FCS institutions to report the total compensation and the amount of each component of compensation paid
to the institution's CEO for each of the last 3 completed fiscal years. If more than one person served in the capacity
of CEO during any given fiscal year, individual compensation information must be reported for each CEO. However,
no disclosure need be provided for any CEO whose salary and bonus (or annualized salary and bonus, if the CEO served
in that capacity less than a year) do not exceed $150,000, adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) for all urban consumers. The 1994 calendar year will serve as the base year for making subsequent CPI adjustments
to the $150,000 disclosure threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;620.5(i)(2)(ii), which would have required FCS institutions to report the aggregate amount of compensation
and the components of compensation paid to all officers as a group, was revised in the final regulation. The FCA did
not perceive the proposed requirement as markedly different from the existing aggregate senior officer compensation
disclosure requirement. Yet, several commenters interpreted the requirement to be more extensive. The FCA decided
to retain the language in the existing rule with some modifications to reduce any ambiguity that may have been raised
by the proposed requirement. Final &sect;620.5(i)(2)(i)(B) requires institutions to report the aggregate amount
of compensation and the components of compensation paid during each of the last 3 completed fiscal years to all senior
officers as a group, stating the number of officers in the group without naming them. As with the existing regulation,
at a minimum, institutions must disclose the aggregate amount of compensation paid to the five most highly compensated
officers, whether or not designated as a senior officer by the board.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A requirement for preparation of a ``Summary Compensation Table'' (table) was added to the final regulation to enhance
the comparability of the compensation disclosures. Commenters indicated there was a need to improve the consistency
of reporting compensation information and suggested the regulations stipulate a format for disclosure. In response,
the general definition of ``compensation'' was eliminated and replaced by the more descriptive table and corresponding
instructions. For purposes of reporting compensation information in the table, compensation is divided into two
main categories: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ``Annual;'' and (2) ``Other.'' The separation is to distinguish normal annual compensation from compensation
that is unusual, infrequent, reflects special circumstances, or is earned during the fiscal year but is not usually
available to the senior officer until a later date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The components of ``Annual'' compensation include salary, bonuses, deferred compensation and perquisites. Amounts
shown as ``salary'' and ``bonus'' are to reflect the gross amounts earned during the fiscal year before any reductions
for amounts contributed during the fiscal year to a 401(k) plan or similar plan. If, for any reason, the exact amount
of salary or bonus earned in the fiscal year is not expected to be known in time for its inclusion in the report, the institution
is to include in the report its best estimate of the compensation amount and provide appropriate footnote disclosure
with the table. Amounts shown as ``deferred/perquisites'' will include such items as deferred compensation, perquisites,
and any other significant personal benefits customarily paid, earned or received on an annual basis. With respect
to deferred compensation, this amount should reflect all forms of deferred compensation earned during the fiscal
year, whether or not paid in cash. For example, if the deferred compensation was earned during the period but payment
in cash was voluntarily deferred by the senior officer to a later period (e.g., upon retirement) the amount earned
must still be included in the current period's compensation amount. Consequently, cash payments under deferred
compensation arrangements where the amounts were earned in previous periods would not be included as part of the current
period's compensation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The category depicted as ``Other'' in the table includes amounts not appropriately characterized as components
of annual compensation. Section 620.5(i)(2)(i)(E) specifies two forms of compensation that should be included
in this category: (1) Compensation in the form of payouts due to a senior officer's resignation, retirement, or termination
from employment; and (2) contributions by the institution on behalf of the senior officer to a defined contribution
plan for which cash payments from the plan are typically not available to the senior officer until a later date. Any
form of compensation in this part must be specifically identified and described in a footnote to the table. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA received a mixed response to proposed &sect;620.5(i)(2)(iii), which would have required FCS institutions
to provide a general discussion of compensation plans of its senior officers. While many commenters supported the
proposed requirement, others believed that the disclosures would be too burdensome to compile. The FCA Board continues
to believe that such discussion would be beneficial in providing explanations of compensation plans to the readers
of the report. For the most part, the final regulation retains the requirements in proposed &sect;620.5(i)(2)(iii)
that FCS institutions provide a description of the compensation plans of all those senior officers covered by the
regulations. Proposed &sect;620.5(i)(2)(iii) (F) and (G), which would have required institutions to discuss the
amounts paid under the plans, were dropped from the final rule because the final rule requires these comments to be
disclosed in the table. The remaining compensation discussion requirements are now contained in &sect;620.5(i)(2)(ii)
in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule clarifies that bank senior officer compensation information is part of the financial information
that should be made available to shareholders of both the bank and its related associations upon request. When the
disclosure regulations in part 620 of this chapter were initially adopted, the FCA determined that, due to the structure
of the System and the impact the banks have on the financial results of the associations, there was a need for association
shareholders to receive the financial information of the bank in addition to the financial information of the association.
Existing &sect;620.4(b) implements this philosophy by requiring banks to distribute their annual reports to shareholders
of related associations. Likewise, under the proposed rule, both the shareholders of the bank and related associations
would have received the bank's annual report containing individual compensation information on the five most highly
compensated bank senior officers. Although the disclosure requirement for individual senior officer compensation
information was limited to CEOs in the final rule, the FCA Board continues to believe that it is important for shareholders
of related associations to have access to individual compensation information of bank senior officers included
in the aggregate disclosure required by &sect;620.5(i)(2)(i)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the required disclosure statement in proposed &sect;620.5(i)(2)(iv) was modified to clarify its requirements
and is now contained in &sect;620.5(i)(2)(iii) in the final rule. Final &sect;620.5(i)(2)(iii) requires institutions
to include a statement in the annual report or the AAMIS (if the association chooses to include compensation information
in the AAMIS) that ``information concerning the total compensation paid during the last fiscal year to any senior
officer or to any other officer included in the aggregate whose compensation exceeds $50,000 is available and will
be disclosed to shareholders of the institution and shareholders of related associations (if applicable) upon request.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The disclosure requirements for travel, subsistence, and other related expenses in the final regulation remain
unchanged from the proposed regulation with one exception. Pursuant to the preceding discussion, the final rule
clarifies that the institution's policy regarding travel, subsistence, and other related expenses should also
be made available to shareholders of related associations (if applicable) upon request.

(a) Farm Credit System banks are authorized to pay fair and reasonable compensation to directors for services performed
in an official capacity at a rate not to exceed the level established in section 4.21 of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as
amended, unless the FCA determines that such a level adversely affects the safety and soundness of the institution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The bank director compensation level established in section 4.21 of the Act shall be adjusted to reflect changes
in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the following
manner: Current year's maximum compensation = Prior year's maximum compensation adjusted by the prior year's annual
average percent change in the CPI for all urban consumers. Adjustments will be made to the bank director statutory
compensation limit beginning from October 28, 1992 (the date of enactment of the Farm Credit Banks and Associations
Safety and Soundness Act of 1992). Additionally, each year the FCA will distribute a bookletter to all FCS banks that
communicates the CPI adjusted bank director statutory compensation limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A waiver of the compensation limitation prescribed by section 4.21 of the Act may be granted under exceptional
circumstances as approved on a case-by-case basis by the FCA. However, the FCA shall not grant a waiver that allows
a bank to pay any director in excess of 30 percent more than the statutory maximum compensation as determined in accordance
with paragraph (b) of this section. A waiver approval shall precede any payments by the bank to its director(s) that
exceed the maximum limitation determined in paragraph (b) of this section. A bank seeking a waiver shall provide the
FCA Chairman with a written request that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Describes and explains the exceptional circumstance(s) that the bank believes necessitates a waiver of section
4.21 of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) States the amount and the terms and conditions (if any) of the proposed compensation level for each director that
would exceed the statutory maximum determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Justifies the compensation level of each director that would exceed the statutory limitation based on the extraordinary
time and service devoted to bank business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA shall respond to written requests within 60 days of receipt of the preceding information and the receipt of
any other additional information requested by the FCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each bank board shall adopt a written policy regarding compensation of bank directors. The policy shall address,
at a minimum, the following areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The activities or functions for which attendance is necessary and appropriate and may be compensated, except
that a Farm Credit System bank shall not compensate any director for rendering services on behalf of any other Farm
Credit System institution or a cooperative of which the director is a member, or for performing other assignments
of a non-official nature;

(A) Report the total amount of compensation paid and the amount of each component of compensation paid to the institution's
chief executive officer (CEO) for each of the last 3 completed fiscal years, naming the individual. If more than one
person served in the capacity of CEO during any given fiscal year, individual compensation disclosures must be provided
for each CEO. Except that, no disclosure need be provided for any CEO whose salary and bonus (or annualized salary and
bonus, if the CEO served in that capacity less than a year) do not exceed $150,000, adjusted annually to reflect changes
in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all urban consumers, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The threshold
for individually disclosing CEO compensation information shall be adjusted in the following manner: Current year's
compensation disclosure threshold = Prior year's compensation disclosure threshold adjusted by the prior year's
annual average percent change in the CPI for all urban consumers. The 1994 calendar year shall serve as the base year
for making subsequent CPI adjustments to the $150,000 compensation disclosure threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Report the aggregate amount of compensation paid and the components of compensation paid during each of the last
3 completed fiscal years to all senior officers as a group, stating the number of officers in the group without naming

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Amounts shown as ``Salary'' (column (c)) and ``Bonus'' (column (d)) shall reflect the dollar value of salary and
bonus earned by the senior officer during the fiscal year. Amounts contributed during the fiscal year by the senior
officer pursuant to a plan established under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, or similar plan, shall be
included in the salary column or bonus column, as appropriate. If the amount of salary or bonus earned during the fiscal
year is not calculable by the time the report is prepared, the reporting institution shall provide its best estimate
of the compensation amount(s) and disclose that fact in a footnote to the table. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Amounts shown as ``deferred/perquisites'' (column (e)) shall reflect the dollar value of other annual compensation
not properly categorized as salary or bonus, including but not limited to:

(E) Compensation amounts reported under the category ``Other'' (column (f)) shall reflect the dollar value of all
other compensation not properly reportable in any other column. Items reported in this column shall be specifically
identified and described in a footnote to the table. Such compensation includes, but is not limited to:

Because this final rule governs matters of agency organization, management and personnel and makes no substantive
change in SBA's regulations, SBA is not required to determine if these changes constitute a major or significant rule
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, to determine if they have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), or to perform a Federalism assessment pursuant to Executive Order 12612. SBA certifies that these changes will
not impose a new recordkeeping or reporting requirement under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. CH 35).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SBA is publishing this regulation governing agency organization, procedure and practice as a final rule without

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Aerospatiale Model ATR72 series
airplanes. This action requires inspections to detect damage, corrosion, or cracking of the hinge pin on each shock
absorber on the main landing gear (MLG), and repair or replacement of the pins, if necessary. This amendment is prompted
by reports of rupture of certain hinge pins due to stress corrosion of the pins in the shock absorber on the MLG on Model
ATR72 series airplanes. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent loss of the MLG during a hard landing
due to malfunction of the shock absorber on the MLG.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all Aerospatiale Model ATR72 series airplanes. The
DGAC advises that it has received reports of rupture of the upper hinge pins in the shock absorber on the main landing
gear (MLG) on Model ATR72 series airplanes. Investigation revealed that these hinge pins ruptured due to stress corrosion
inside the pin. Corrosion inside the hinge pins, if not detected and corrected in a timely manner, could result in malfunction
of the shock absorber on the MLG. This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of the MLG during a hard landing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Avions de Transport Regional (ATR) has issued Service Bulletin ATR72&hyph;32&hyph;1025, dated April 5, 1994. This
service bulletin references Messier-Bugatti Service Bulletin 631&hyph;32&hyph;099, dated April 12, 1994, for
additional service information. The Messier-Bugatti service bulletin describes procedures for repetitive visual
inspections (using a borescope) to detect damage to the protective treatments on the inside diameter of the hinge
pin on each shock absorber on the MLG. The service bulletin describes procedures for stripping any damaged protective
treatments to determine if the base metal is corroded, completing a paint scheme of the damaged area, and reinstalling
any pin on which no corrosion of the base metal is found. For pins on which the base metal is corroded, the service bulletin
describes procedures for removal of the corrosion and a dye penetrant or fluorescent penetrant inspection to detect
cracking of the pin; repair or replacement of any uncracked pin; and replacement of any cracked pin with a serviceable
pin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DGAC classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;065&hyph;020(B),
dated March 30, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent loss of the MLG during a hard landing. This
AD requires repetitive visual inspections (using a borescope) to detect damage to the protective treatments on the
inside diameter of the hinge pin on each shock absorber on the MLG. This AD also requires stripping any damaged protective
treatments to determine if the base metal is corroded. For pins on which the base metal is not corroded, this AD requires
completion of a paint scheme of the damaged area and reinstallation of the pin. For pins on which the base metal is corroded,
this AD requires removal of the corrosion and a dye penetrant or fluorescent penetrant inspection to detect cracking
of the pin; repair or replacement of any uncracked pin; and replacement of any cracked pin with a serviceable pin. The
actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the Messier-Bugatti service bulletin described previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Messier-Bugatti advises that a modification of the link between the shock absorber and the universal joint is currently
under study. Therefore, this AD is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time
the FAA may consider further rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;95&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260&hyph;3, 8260&hyph;4, and 8260&hyph;5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as stated
above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard
for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs by FDC/P NOTAMs,
the TERPS criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports. All SIAP amendments
in this rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as
an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPS. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 19, 1993 (58 FR 61598), FDA published a final rule amending the regulations in &sect;20.89 (21 CFR 20.89),
effective December 20, 1993, to provide that the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (the Commissioner) may designate
any other FDA officer or employee to act on the Commissioner's behalf to authorize the nonpublic disclosure, under
certain specified conditions, of confidential commercial information submitted to FDA or incorporated into agency-prepared
records. This amendment permits such disclosure to foreign government officials who perform counterpart functions
to FDA as part of cooperative law enforcement or regulatory efforts. The amendment also permits the disclosure of
trade secret information to visiting foreign scientists under certain limited conditions. Section 5.23 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Disclosure of official records
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 5.23) is being revised to add &sect;20.89(c) to the sections already referenced in &sect;5.23(a), and to list
those officials authorized to make such disclosures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further redelegation of the authority delegated is not authorized. Authority delegated to a position by title may
be exercised by a person officially designated to serve in such position in an acting capacity or on a temporary basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 26, 1988 (53 FR 19046), FDA announced that another food additive petition (FAP 8A4068) had been filed by Pfizer,
proposing to amend the same regulation for the safe use of polydextrose in fruit spreads. Then, in a notice published

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 15, 1989 (54 FR 10727), the agency announced that Pfizer had filed a third food additive petition (FAP 9A4126),
proposing to amend the same regulation for the safe use of polydextrose in sweet sauces, toppings, and syrups. In a
notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 18, 1992 (57 FR 54406), FDA announced that the agency was amending the filing notices for three food additive
petitions (FAP's 7A3998, 8A4068, and 9A4126) filed by Pfizer, dated January 26 and May 26, 1988, and March 15, 1989,
respectively, to state that the petitioner had requested that &sect;172.841 be amended to include, through incorporation
by reference, specifications of the ``Food Chemicals Codex,'' 3d ed. (1981), 2d supp. (1986), pp. 57 through 59, and
3d supp. (1992), p. 136.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has estimated that the proposed uses of polydextrose in peanut spread, fruit spreads, sweet sauces, toppings,
and syrups would add no more than 4.2 grams per person per day (g/p/d) to the mean and 4.6 g/p/d to the 90th percentile
estimated daily intake (EDI) for the 2- to 5-year age group and 3.2 g/p/d to the mean and 4.1 g/p/d to the 90th percentile
EDI for the 2+ years age group (all ages). Upon regulation, the cumulative EDI will be no greater than 16 g/p/d for mean
consumption and 26 g/p/d for consumption at the 90th percentile for the 2- to 5-year-old-age group and 18 g/p/d (mean)
and 29 g/p/d (90th percentile) for the ``all ages'' age group (Ref. 1).

II. Lead Specification for Polydextrose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has been attempting to reduce consumer exposure to lead in foods by revising or setting new lead specifications
for food additives. (See 59 FR 5363, February 4, 1994). During the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC) Committee workshop on
May 2, 1991, the agency presented its concerns regarding lead levels in food additives. The FCC Committee of the National
Academy of Science/Institute of Medicine thereafter revised its policy for establishing lead specifications for
food additives to require that lead specifications should be set at the lowest levels practicable on the basis of:
(1) Current good manufacturing practice; (2) potential hazard; (3) the availability of analytical methodology
for the determination of low lead levels in food matrices; and (4) estimates of food intake. Revised and new lead specifications
have recently been published for a number of food ingredients in the ``Food Chemicals Codex,'' 3d ed., 3d supp. (1992).
In amending the current regulation for polydextrose (21 CFR 172.841), the agency is incorporating by reference the
specifications for polydextrose set out in the ``Food Chemicals Codex ,'' 3d ed., 2d supp. (1986), as amended by the
3d supp. (1992), including the new lowered specifications for lead (0.5 parts per million (ppm)) as well as that for
heavy metals (as lead) (5 ppm).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency concludes that the available data provide reasonable certainty of no harm from the proposed food additive
uses. In reaching this conclusion, the agency has considered the potential for excessive consumption of polydextrose
to cause laxation effects in sensitive individuals. 21 CFR 172.841(d) currently requires that consumers be informed
of this potential through special labeling of products containing more than 15 g of polydextrose per serving. The
agency has considered the cumulative effect of the additional petitioned uses and has concluded that the current
labeling requirement is adequate to protect the public. Accordingly, the agency is amending &sect;172.841 of the
food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of polydextrose in peanut spread, fruit spreads, sweet sauces,
toppings, and syrups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petitions and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petitions are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.

IV. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment for each of the three petitions, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address
above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a new animal
drug application (NADA) filed by Wildlife Laboratories, Inc. The NADA provides for the subcutaneous use of melatonin
implant in healthy male and female kit and adult female mink to accelerate the fur priming cycle.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Wildlife Laboratories, Inc., 1401 Duff Dr., suite 600, Fort Collins, CO 80524, filed NADA 140&hyph;846 which provides
for the subcutaneous use of melatonin implant in healthy male and female kit and adult female mink (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Mustela vison
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) to accelerate the fur priming cycle. The drug product is an implant consisting of a silicone rubber elastomer that
contains 2.7 milligrams of homogeneously dispersed melatonin. The NADA is approved as of June 21, 1994, and the regulations
are amended in part 522 (21 CFR part 522) by adding new &sect;522.1350 to reflect the approval. The basis for approval
is discussed in the freedom of information summary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and &sect;514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(i)), this approval
qualifies for 5 years of marketing exclusivity beginning June 21, 1994, because no active ingredient (including
any ester or salt of the active ingredient) has been approved in any other application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Justification for Final Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule
where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1)
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment,
in that prior public procedure is unnecessary, and not required, because the rule is in the nature of a clarification
that reflects the Department's interpretation of existing requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background and Justification for Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 10, 1994, the Department issued amendments to its regulations to implement sections 908 and 951 of the
Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (Act). That Act expanded
the coverage of RESPA to include mortgages secured by subordinate liens, and restated the Department's authority
over refinancing transactions. The Department's final rule of February 10, 1994, adopted certain definitions and
disclosure requirements of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation Z, to minimize
the burden on lenders and others in complying with different or conflicting definitions and disclosure requirements
for transactions also covered by the TILA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As published, the preamble and the final rule contained material that might have been misleading, so the Department
published a correction to clarify certain provisions in the rule (59 FR 14748). The Department has now determined
that two additional clarifications of the final rule would be helpful. Because the final rule has an effective date
of August 9, 1994, the Department is also making these technical amendments effective on August 9, 1994. A longer period
before effectiveness of these amendments would not benefit the public, and coinciding effective dates for the rule
and amendments may avoid unnecessary confusion about the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The rule is in the nature of a clarification that merely reflects the Department's interpretation
of existing requirements.

Because this rule clarifies a rule published on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6505), the finding of no significant impact
prepared for that rule remains applicable, and is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.
weekdays in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing and

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving, with certain exceptions and additional requirements, a proposed amendment to the North Dakota
permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the ``North Dakota program'') under the Surface Mining
Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment consists primarily of changes to provisions
of the North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) and the North Dakota Administrative Code (NDAC) concerning the Small Operator
Assistance Program (SOAP), the definition of ``road'' as referenced in the coal exploration performance standards,
and authorization for individual civil and criminal penalties under the coal exploration program. The amendment
is intended to revise the North Dakota program to be consistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated April 21, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;01), North Dakota submitted a proposed
amendment (``Amendment XVIII'') to its permanent program pursuant to SMCRA. North Dakota proposed this amendment
in response to required program amendments at 30 CFR part 934.16 (l) and (y), published in the January 9, 1992, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 827). In addition, North Dakota proposed State-initiated changes to the requirements for preblasting surveys
and to NDCC chapter 38&hyph;14.1 reflecting 1992 changes to the Small Operator Assistance Program by the Energy Policy
Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486) (Energy Policy Act) at sections 507 (c) and (h) of SMCRA. (For a document relating
to the regulatory provisions proposed by North Dakota for preblasting surveys and small operator assistance, see

 (58 FR 29155) announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on its adequacy (administrative record
No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;7). The public comment period ended June 18, 1993. The public hearing, scheduled for June 14,
1993, was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to: (1) The proposed provisions at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4),
regarding SOAP requirements for reimbursement of training costs and NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5), regarding
the prohibition of SOAP assistance to operations not subject to payment of AML fees; (2) the requirement for North
Dakota to revise its implementing rules at North Dakota Administrative Code (NDAC) 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29 to be consistent
with the proposed statutory revisions; and (3) the proposed revisions at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), regarding
the definition of ``road'' and NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08, regarding the authorization for individual civil and
criminal penalties under the coal exploration program. OSM notified North Dakota of these concerns by letter dated
November 12, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;14).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by submitting additional explanatory information and a
revised amendment (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;15). Specifically, North Dakota: (1) Stated, with
respect to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4), SOAP requirements for reimbursement of training costs, that it will propose
the necessary statutory change in the next legislative session; (2) provided a statement of clarification regarding
North Dakota's intent with respect to its implementing rules for the revised SOAP statutory provisions; and (3) proposed
to revise its rules at NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2), regarding the definition of ``road'' and NDAC
43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05, regarding the authorization for individual civil and criminal penalties under the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice dated January 9, 1992 (57 FR 807, 816&hyph;17), current NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) is similar to the Federal
counterpart provision at section 510(c) of SMCRA, but the Federal provision, unlike the State counterpart, does
not contain a temporal limitation upon the violations considered by the regulatory authority in making its decision
to approve or deny a permit. The three-year temporal limitation in current NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) renders
North Dakota's statutory provision less stringent than section 510(c) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Dakota has now proposed to delete the three-year temporal limitation from NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5),
thus rendering it no less stringent than section 510(c) of SMCRA. The Director notes that North Dakota's reference
to SMCRA in revised NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) is interpreted to include SMCRA, its implementing rules, and all
state and federal programs enacted pursuant to SMCRA. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See e.g.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director finds North Dakota's proposed statutory revision at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) to be no less stringent
than section 510(c) of SMCRA and is approving the proposed change.

2. NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e), Environmental Protection Performance Standards, Preblasting Survey Criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to revise NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e) by requiring that a preblasting survey be conducted
by the permittee when requested by the resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one mile [1.61 kilometers]
of any portion of the permitted area. Currently, the North Dakota statutory provision requires such a preblasting
survey when requested by the resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one-half mile [804.67 meters]
of any portion of the permitted area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 515(b)(15)(E) of SMCRA requires that a preblasting survey be conducted when requested by the resident or
owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one-half mile of any portion of the permitted area. North Dakota's
proposed revision to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e) thus allows a potentially larger group of residents or owners
within the vicinity of a mine to request a preblasting survey than is provided for by SMCRA. In accordance with section
505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental
controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed
under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land
use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for hich no Federal
counterpart exists Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed
to be inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director is approving the proposed statutory
change at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the introductory text of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2), North Dakota proposed to increase the amount of probable
total annual production allowed for SOAP applicants from one hundred thousand tons [90,718.47 metric tons] to three
hundred thousand tons [272,155.41 metric tons]. North Dakota also proposed, in the introductory text of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2),
that the costs of certain activities specified at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2) (a) through (f) (discussed at findings
3 (b) through (g) below), which must be performed by a qualified public or private entity designated by the Commission,
may be assumed by the Commission upon the written request of an operator in connection with a permit application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Dakota's proposed revision to increase the amount of probable total annual production allowed for SOAP applicants
from one hundred thousand tons to three hundred thousand tons is consistent with and no less stringent than section
507(c)(1) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Dakota's proposal regarding the cost of certain activities that the Commission may assume upon written request
of an operator in connection with a permit application would appear to grant discretion to the regulatory authority
that is not granted in section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA. Section 507(c)(1) requires that the specified costs ``shall''
be assumed by the regulatory authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This SMCRA provision is implemented in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 795.9(a), which require the payment of such
costs for eligible applicants who request the assistance ``[t]o the extent possible with available funds.'' Similarly,
North Dakota's rules at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02 (introductory text) also require that the Commission
pay costs for qualified applicants who request the assistance ``[t]o the extent possible with available funds.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director finds North Dakota's proposed revisions to the introductory text of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2),
when read in light of the regulatory limitations at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02, to be no less stringent than
section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA and no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements as set forth in the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 795.9(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the discussion above, the Director is approving the proposed changes to the introductory text of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(a) to incorporate a portion of original NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)
allowing the commission's possible assumption, for qualified SOAP applicants, of the cost of the determination
of probable hydrologic consequences (PHC determination) required by NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;14(1)(o) and to specify
that such costs include the engineering analyses and designs necessary for the PHC determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(a) is substantively similar to and is no less stringent than section 507(c)(1)(A)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(d) allowing the Commission's possible assumption,
for qualified SOAP applicants, of the cost of the collection of cultural resource information required by NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;14(1)(u),
any other archaeological and historical information required by the superintendent of the state historical board,
and the preparation of mitigation plans necessitated thereby.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(d) is substantively similar to and no less stringent than section 507(c)(1)(D)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(e) allowing the Commission's possible assumption,
for qualified SOAP applicants, of the cost of preblast surveys required by NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e). In
addition to this proposal, and as explained in the discussion in Finding No. 2 above, OSM is approving North Dakota's
proposed revision to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e), which requires a preblasting survey to be conducted by
the permittee when requested by the resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one mile [1.61 kilometers]
of any portion of the permitted area. Taken in conjunction with North Dakota's proposed revision to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e),
proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(e) would allow North Dakota's SOAP program to pay for preblast surveys conducted
within one mile from the permit boundary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 507(c)(1)(E) of SMCRA authorizes payment for preblast surveys only in accordance with section 515(b)(15)(E)
of SMCRA. Section 515(b)(15)(E), in turn, requires the applicant or permittee to conduct a preblasting survey upon
request of a resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one-half mile of any portion of the permitted
area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, taken together, proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e) and 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(e) effectively
allow the Commission to use SOAP funds to cover potentially more costly preblast surveys than would be required under
SMCRA. Since North Dakota has a preblast survey program requirement (1 mile) that is more stringent than SMCRA's preblast
survey program requirement (1/2 mile), small operators in North Dakota must meet the more stringent State standard.
Accordingly, the additional costs associated with North Dakota's requirements regarding preblasting surveys
may be paid for with SOAP funds. Finally, section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) provide that any State law or regulation
that provides for more stringent land use and environmental controls and regulations for surface coal mining and
reclamation operations than do SMCRA or the Federal regulations shall not be construed to be inconsistent with SMCRA.
Thus, based upon the discussion above, the Director finds that proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(d) is not
inconsistent with section 507(c)(1)(E) of SMCRA and the Federal program and is approving it.

North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(f) allowing the Commission's possible assumption,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(f) is substantively similar to and no less stringent than section 507(c)(1)(F)
of SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director is approving proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(f).

Section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA requires that the Secretary ``shall'' provide or assume the cost of training coal operators
that meet the qualifications stated in section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA concerning the preparation of permit applications
and compliance with the regulatory program. Moreover, section 507(c)(2) provides that the Secretary ``shall''
ensure that qualified coal operators are aware of the assistance available under section 507(c) of SMCRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3) appears to grand discretion to the State regulatory authority regarding
the provision of training assistance that is now allowed by section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. However, section 507(c)(2)
specifically references only ``the Secretary.'' OSM currently interprets ``the Secretary'' to mean the Secretary
of the Interior, and not State regulatory authorities. Therefore, North Dakota's proposed statutory language at
NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3) is acceptable and it is unnecessary for North Dakota to revise proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3)
to be substantively identical to section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. However, if North Dakota ultimately decides to adopt
the responsibility to provide or assume the training costs and inform qualified coal operators of the availability
of assistance under SOAP, NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3), because of its discretionary nature, will be less stringent
than section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. North Dakota will then be required to amend its program to mandate that the Commission
``shall'' provide or assume the costs of training and inform qualified coal operators of the availability of assistance
under SOAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, on the basis of the discussion above, proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3) is no less stringent than
section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. For the reasons discussed above, the Director is approving proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3).

This North Dakota proposal is similar to section 507(h) of SMCRA with one exception. Since the North Dakota proposal
only refers to services provided under NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2), it does not encompass any training assistance
that may have been provided under NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3). By comparison, the Federal provision at section
507(h) of SMCRA requires operators, under such circumstances, to reimburse the regulatory authority for the cost
of any training assistance provided by the regulatory authority, as well as for the cost of other services provided
or funded by the regulatory authority under the SOAP program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Dakota, in a letter dated December 3, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;15), acknowledged that
proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4) does not require the reimbursement of training costs in accordance with
section 507(h) of SMCRA, and stated that it will propose the necessary statutory change in the next North Dakota legislative
session. Moreover, North Dakota stated that if proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4) were approved, as submitted,
the State would not provide or assume the cost of training any small operator until such time as the statutory revisions
are made. As discussed in Finding No. 3(h) above, OSM currently interprets section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA to require that
the Secretary of the Interior, and not the State regulatory authority, provide or assume the cost of training coal
operators and, in accordance with that interpretation, North Dakota is not obligated to do so. However, should North
Dakota decide to provide training as a result of revising proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3) discussed above,
and use SOAP funds to do so in accordance with 30 CFR 795.5, the failure of proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(34)
to require the reimbursement of training costs to the Commission will be less stringent than the requirements of section
507(h) of SMCRA. Nevertheless, since North Dakota has stated that it will not provide or assume the cost of such training
until full reimbursement of the cost of all SOAP assistance is statutorily required, the Director finds that NDCC
38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4), as proposed, is no less stringent than section 507(h) of SMCRA, and is approving it.

j. NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5), Prohibition of SOAP Assistance to Operations Not Subject to Payment of Reclamation
Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5) to read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed surface coal mining operation that will not be subject to payment of reclamation fees required by [SMCRA]
are not eligible for the assistance to small operators provided by [NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37 (2) and (3)].
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are certain mining operations in the State of North Dakota that are considered coal mining operations under
the State program and thus are regulated in the State pursuant to the North Dakota program, but which are not subject
to the payment of reclamation fees pursuant to section 402 of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the North Dakota program encompasses operations extracting coal incidental to the extraction of other
minerals where coal does not exceed 162/3 percent of the tonnage of minerals removed for purposes of commercial use
or sale (incidental coal mining operation). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 57 FR 37702, 37703&hyph;37704, (August 20, 1992). In contrast, the Federal definition of the term ``surface coal
mining operations'' at 701(28)(A) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 700.5 specifically excludes incidental coal mining operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, North Dakota regulates leonardite operations under its coal regulatory program. In contrast, OSM has
taken the position that leonardite is not ``coal'' as defined in 30 CFR 700.5, and thus leonardite operations are not
subject to regulation or oversight by OSM under SMCRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 December 14, 1982, letter from OSM to the North Dakota Public Service Commission (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;17).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA provides for SOAP assistance to a qualified ``coal surface mining operator.'' Accordingly,
since incidental coal and leonardite operations are not considered ``surface coal mining operations'' under the
Federal program, such operations would not be regulated by OSM pursuant to SMCRA and thus would not qualify for SOAP
assistance under SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operators who will be deemed ineligible for SOAP assistance under the North Dakota proposal would not qualify
for such assistance under the Federal program. Accordingly, the Director finds that North Dakota's proposed statute
at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5) is not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Director is approving it.

4. Coal Exploration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of clarification, the Director notes that in North Dakota, jurisdiction over surface coal mining and
reclamation operations, including the Small Operator Assistance Program, is with the North Dakota Public Service
Commission. However, jurisdiction over coal exploration, of which the following proposed revisions and findings
pertain to, is with the North Dakota Industrial Commission, through the office of the Geological Survey. Thus, the
surface coal mining and reclamation operation and coal exploration components of the North Dakota permanent program
are administered by separate agencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), which defines the term ``road,'' as used in the
coal exploration portions of the North Dakota program, to read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Road'' means a surface or right of way for purposes of travel by land vehicles used in coal exploration. A road consists
of the entire area of the right of way, including the roadbed, shoulders, parking and side areas, approaches, structure,
ditches, and surface.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 701.5 defines ``road,'' in part, as ``[a] surface right-of-way for purposes of travel
by land vehicles used in surface coal mining and reclamation operations or coal exploration.'' In a letter dated November
12, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;14), OSM identified two concerns with North Dakota's proposed
definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, OSM stated that North Dakota's use of the word ``or'' in the first sentence of its proposed definition of ``road''
appeared to serve no useful purpose. Read literally, the proposed definition states that ``[r]oad means a surface
[for purposes of travel] *&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a right-of-way for purposes of travel *&blank;*&blank;*'' (emphasis added). OSM requested in its November 12, 1993,
letter that North Dakota either: (1) Correct what appeared to be an editorial error in a subsequent rulemaking; or
(2) clarify how the definition of ``road'' would be interpreted and applied.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded that during the course of coal exploration, roads may be
temporarily altered to leave established easements or rights-of-way and that the proposed definition of ``road''
at proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6) includes those roads. North Dakota further stated that the ``surface''
used for purposes of travel by land vehicles used in coal exploration are subject to regulation, whether those vehicles
are traveling within established rights-of-way or outside of them. Based upon the State's explanation, the Director
finds that North Dakota's use of the word ``or'' in its proposed definition of ``road'' is not inconsistent with the
Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, OSM requested that North Dakota clarify its intent regarding the differences between the proposed definition
of ``road'' in the coal exploration portions of the State program and the already-approved definition of ``road''
in the surface coal mining and reclamation operations portions of the State program (NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;01&hyph;02(92)).
Specifically, the approved definition of ``road'' at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;01&hyph;02(92), like the Federal
counterpart definition, explicitly includes access and haulroads constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained
for use in operations, including use by coal hauling vehicles to and from transfer, processing, or storage areas.
Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), however, does not contain a similar list of various types of roads encompassed
by the definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by acknowledging that the proposed definition of ``road''
at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6) includes all rights-of-way used in coal exploration and was not intended to include
exhaustive examples of all types of roads. North Dakota also submitted a proposed revision to its coal exploration
regulations at NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2). The revised regulation would include a new clause clarifying
that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A road is altered if it is constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained in any way that causes the changes described
in this section.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal regulation defining ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5 insofar as it concerns coal exploration, also includes ``[a]ccess
and haul roads constructed, used, reconstructed, improved, or maintained for use in *&blank;*&blank;* coal exploration
*&blank;*&blank;* .'' Thus, North Dakota's inclusion of the additional terms ``constructed, reconstructed, improved,
and maintained'' into its coal exploration regulations at NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2), when read
in conjunction with the discussion above regarding the proposed statutory definition of ``road'' at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6),
effectively defines the term ``road'' to include all rights-of-way used in coal exploration as well as roads constructed,
reconstructed, improved, or maintained in any way. The Director finds that North Dakota has clarified OSM's concerns
with respect to North Dakota's interpretation of its proposed statutory definition of ``road'' at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6)
to ensure that it is consistent with the interpretation of the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, the Director finds that proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), defining the term
``road,'' and proposed NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2), that includes the additional clarifying terms
``constructed, reconstructed, improved, and maintained'' into its coal exploration regulations, are in accordance
and consistent with the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5. Accordingly, the Director is approving the
proposed changes and is removing the required program amendment codified at 30 CFR 934.16(l).

North Dakota proposed to revise NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;04(1)(a) to grant the Industrial Commission (Commission)
the authority to require the furnishing of a reasonable bond amount sufficient to ensure the reclamation of roads
used in coal exploration. Specifically, North Dakota proposed to revise NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;04(1)(a) to provide
that the Commission, acting through the office of the state geologist, has the authority to require (italicized language

The Federal program does not require bonding for coal exploration. Thus, North Dakota's proposed revision specifically
referencing roads used in coal exploration with respect to the furnishing of a reasonable bond for reclamation goes
beyond the requirements of the Federal program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 739.11(b), the State regulatory authority
has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on coal exploration operations
that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory
authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on coal exploration operations
for which no Federal counterpart exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) dictate that such provisions
shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Accordingly, the Director is approving the proposed
revision to NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;04(1)(a).

committed a violation, the proposed revisions did not indicate under what circumstances an individual director,
officer, or agent will be deemed to have committed a violation. In contrast, section 518(f) of SMCRA specifically
addresses the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer, or agent may be individually subject to either
civil or criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee. Section 518(f) of

under this Act *&blank;*&blank;* any director, officer, or agent of such corporation who willfully and knowingly
authorized, ordered, or carried out such violation, failure, or refusal shall be subject to the same civil penalties,
fines, and imprisonment that may be imposed upon a person under [sections 518(a) and (e) of SMCRA].

OSM stated that in order to be no less stringent than section 518(f) of SMCRA, North Dakota must revise proposed NDCC
38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 to clearly subject corporate directors, officers, or agents, to individual civil and criminal
penalties in connection with violations committed by a corporate permittee, under the circumstances outlined in
section 518(f) of SMCRA.

By letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by submitting for OSM's approval the following proposed
regulatory amendment to NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever a corporate permittee violates NDCC 38&hyph;12.1 [statutory requirements addressing coal exploration]
or any permit condition or rule or other regulation implemented thereunder, a director, officer or agent of the corporate
permittee who knowingly causes such violation is subject to the criminal penalties imposed under NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08(2).
``Knowingly'' is to be understood as defined by NDCC 12.1&hyph;02&hyph;02. In addition, whenever a director, officer,
or agent of a corporate permittee willfully or negligently violates NDCC 38&hyph;12.1 or any permit condition or
rule or regulation implemented thereunder, civil penalties may be imposed under NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08(1).
``Willfully'' and ``negligently'' are to be understood as defined by NDCC 12.1&hyph;02&hyph;02.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota's proposed regulatory change addresses the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer
or agent may be individually subject to criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate
permittee. However, the proposed regulatory change does not address the circumstances under which a corporate director,
officer or agent may be individually subject to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
civil
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee. Accordingly, the Director is approving
proposed NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05 to the extent that it specifically addresses the circumstances under
which a corporate director, officer or agent may be individually subject to criminal penalties in connection with
a violation committed by a corporate permittee. However, the Director is requiring North Dakota to further amend
NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05 to specifically address the circumstances under which a corporate director,
officer, or agent may be individually subject to civil penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate
permittee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, because North Dakota's proposed statutory revisions do not address when a corporate director, officer
or agent may be individually subject to either civil or criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed
by a corporate permittee, proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 remains deficient. Therefore, the Director is not
approving NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 and is requiring North Dakota to amend NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 to specifically
address the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer, or agent may be individually subject to either
civil or criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee.

2. Nature of Violations That Subject Individuals to Penalties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the November 12, 1993, letter, OSM notified North Dakota that NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08(1) would subject an individual
to civil penalties for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 violation and would subject individuals to criminal penalties for any violation committed ``knowingly.'' In contrast,
section 518(f) of SMCRA subjects a corporate director, officer, or agent to penalties only when that individual ``willfully
and knowingly authorized, ordered, or carried out'' the act or omission that constitutes the violation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, OSM noted that because proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 would subject individuals to civil and criminal
penalties for a wider, more inclusive, range of actions or omissions than are covered by SMCRA 518(f), it would be more
stringent than SMCRA. However, OSM requested that North Dakota clarify its intent regarding these provisions and
reaffirm that these provisions did not conflict with other State law requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in Finding No. 4(c)(1) above, by letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by submitting
for OSM's approval proposed regulatory amendments to NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05. Those proposed regulatory
amendments provide for criminal penalties in connection with violations committed ``knowingly'' and civil penalties
in connection with violations committed either ``willfully'' or ``negligently.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Dakota also attached a copy of the cross-referenced definitions of the terms ``knowingly,'' ``willfully,''
and ``negligently'' at section 12.1&hyph;02&hyph;02 of the North Dakota Criminal Code. In accordance with that
provision, a person engages in conduct:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

a. ``Intentionally'' if, when he engages in the conduct, it is his purpose to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. ``Knowingly'' if, when he engages in the conduct, he knows or has a firm belief, unaccompanied by substantial doubt,
that he is doing so, whether or not it is his purpose to do so.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
c. ``Recklessly'' if he engages in the conduct in conscious and unjustifiable disregard of a substantial likelihood
of the existence of the relevant facts or risks, such disregard involving a gross deviation from acceptable standards
of conduct, except that, as provided in section 12.1&hyph;04&hyph;02, awareness of the risk is not required where
its absence is due to self-induced intoxication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. ``Negligently'' if he engages in the conduct in unreasonable disregard of a substantial likelihood of the existence
of the relevant facts or risks, such disregard involving a gross deviation from acceptable standards of conduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. ``Willfully'' if he engages in the conduct intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota stated that the above-described standards are more stringent than the Federal standard. North Dakota
also stated that it has been enforcing a similar standard in its environmental laws for a long time without any problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director has reviewed the State definitions of the terms ``knowingly,'' ``willfully,'' and ``negligently''
in connection with the review of proposed NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05. The Director notes that the proposed
State standards are substantively different from the Federal standards set forth at 30 CFR 846.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the Federal standard is the same for both individual civil and criminal penalties, while the State proposes
two separate standards for individual civil and criminal penalties. Under the Federal rules, a corporate director,
officer, or agent may be individually subject to either civil or criminal penalties if that individual both ``knowingly''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``willfully'' authorized, ordered, or carried out the act or omission that constitutes the violation. In contrast,
the State has proposed two separate standards for individual civil and criminal penalties. Under the State proposal,
a corporate director, officer, or agent may be individually subject to criminal penalties in connection with a violation
committed by the corporate permittee if the individual knowingly caused the violation. In comparison, under the
State proposal, a corporate director, officer, or agent is subject to individual civil penalties if that individual
commits a violation ``willfully'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``negligently.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although North Dakota and OSM use some of the same terms in describing their standards for the imposition of individual
civil and criminal penalties, the terms are not defined the same in the State program as they are in the Federal program.
For example, the Federal definition of the term ``knowingly'' at 30 CFR 846.5 reads as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Knowingly'' means that an individual knew or had reason to know in authorizing, ordering or carrying out an act or
omission on the part of a corporate permittee that such act or omission constituted a violation, failure or refusal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Federal definition of the term ``willfully'' at 30 CFR 846.5 reads as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Willfully'' means that an individual acted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Either intentionally, voluntarily or consciously, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) With intentional disregard or plain indifference to legal requirements in authorizing, ordering or carrying
out a corporate permittee's action or omission that constituted a violation, failure or refusal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After conducting an independent review and analysis, the Director agrees with North Dakota that its proposed standards
for the imposition of individual civil and criminal penalties appear to be more stringent than the Federal standards.
Pursuant to section 505(b) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority
has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on coal exploration operations
that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory
authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on coal exploration operations
for which no Federal counterpart exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) dictate that such provisions
shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Accordingly, the Director is approving North
Dakota's proposed definitions of the terms ``knowingly,'' ``willfully,'' and ``negligently'' and that portion
of North Dakota's Criminal Code at section 12.1&hyph;02&hyph;02 that contains those definitions, as incorporated
at NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05, as part of North Dakota's coal exploration program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, OSM, in the November 12, 1993, letter, notified North Dakota that, unlike section 518(f) of SMCRA, proposed
NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 does not explicitly include failure of refusal to comply with orders of the Commission
as cause to subject individuals to penalties. In addition, OSM noted that the North Dakota coal exploration program
does not explicitly address the issuance of orders by the Commission and that the program was approved by OSM on the
basis of North Dakota's agreement to issue each coal exploration permit with a specific condition subjecting it to
the requirements of 30 CFR 840, 842, 843, 845, and 43 CFR part 4 (see 45 FR 82214, 82226; December 15, 1980) Section 518(f)
of SMCRA subjects individuals to penalties when corporate permittees fail or refuse to comply with enforcement orders
or any order (with minor exceptions) incorporated in a final decision of the regulatory authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the December 3, 1993, letter, North Dakota responded by acknowledging that its provisions at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08
regarding liability and penalties for failure to comply with orders of the Industrial Commission should be clearer,
and expressed its willingness to approach the North Dakota Legislature in 1995 to request an amendment to NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08
to include civil and criminal penalties for violations such orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director agrees that North Dakota must amend NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08. Therefore, the Director is not approving
proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 and is requiring North Dakota to amend its program to require that, in addition
to violations, failure or refusal to comply with such orders, as listed in section 518(f) of SMCRA and issued by the
North Dakota Industrial Commission, serves as an additional basis for imposing individual civil and criminal penalties
upon corporate officers, directors, and agents. The required program amendment placed on North Dakota's program
at 30 CFR 934.16(y), as a result of a January 9, 1992, rulemaking action (57 FR 807, 823&hyph;24) will be modified to
reflect this decision.

Based on the above findings, the Director approves, with three exceptions, North Dakota's proposed amendment as
submitted on April 21, 1993, and revised on December 3, 1993. As discussed in: Finding No. 1, North Dakota's proposed
statutory revisions to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) regarding permit approval or denial standards; Finding No.
2, the proposed statutory revisions to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e) regarding preblasting survey criteria;
Finding No. 3(a), the proposed statutory revisions to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2) regarding the probable total
annual coal production and testing costs, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(b), newly-created
NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(a) regarding probable hydrologic consequences and engineering designs, as they
apply to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(c), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(b) regarding
the development of cross sections, maps, and plans, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(d),
newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(c) regarding geologic drilling and a statement of the results of test
borings and core samplings, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(e), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(d)
regarding cultural resource information, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(f), newly-created
NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(e) regarding the payment of costs for preblasting surveys, as it applies to the North
Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(g), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(f) regarding fish and wildlife
habitat enhancement plans, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(h), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3)
regarding North Dakota's discretionary authority to provide or assume training costs for small operators; Finding
No. 3(i), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4) regarding the requirements for small operator reimbursement
to North Dakota for the cost of permit application materials and training; Finding No. 3(j), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5)
regarding the prohibition of assistance to small operations not subject to payment of AML fees; Finding No. 4(a),
the proposed definition of ``road'' at newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), the clarifying terminology
proposed at revised NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2), and removal of the required program amendment at
30 CFR 934.16(1); Finding No. 4(b), the proposed statutory revision to NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;04(1)(a) regarding
the Commission's authority to require a reasonable bond amount sufficient to ensure the reclamation of roads used
in coal exploration; Finding No. 4(c)(1), newly-proposed NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05, to the extent that
it specifically addresses the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer or agent may be individually
subject to criminal penalties in connection with a violation committee by a corporate permittee; and finally, as
discussed in Finding No. 4(c)(2), North Dakota's newly-proposed standards for civil and criminal penalties, which
use the proposed definitions of the terms ``knowingly,'' ``willfully,'' and ``negligently,'' as set forth in North
Dakota's Criminal Code at 12.1&hyph;02&hyph;02 and incorporated at NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05, as part
of North Dakota's coal exploration program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as discussed in Finding Nos. 4 (c)(1) and (c)(3), the Director is not approving the proposed statutory revisions
to NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 and is requiring North Dakota to amend its program to (1) specifically address the circumstances
under which a corporate director, officer, or agent may be individually subject to either civil or criminal penalties
in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee; and (2) require that, in addition to violations,
failure or refusal to comply with orders, as listed in section 518(f) of SMCRA and issued by the North Dakota Industrial
Commission, serves as an additional basis for imposing individual civil and criminal penalties upon corporate officers,
directors, and agents. The required program amendment placed on North Dakota's program at 30 CFR 934.16(y) will be
modified to reflect this decision. In addition, as discussed in Finding No. 4(c)(1), the Director is requiring North
Dakota to further amend NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05 to specifically address the circumstances under which
a corporate director, officer or agent may be individually subject to civil penalties in connection with a violation
committed by a corporate permittee. Except as noted, the Director is approving these proposed rules with the provision
that they be fully promulgated in identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(f)(1), the Director is also taking this opportunity to clarify in the required amendment
section at 30 CFR 934.16 that, within 60 days of the publishing of this notice, North Dakota would have to either submit
a proposed written amendment, or a description of an amendment to be proposed that meets the requirements of SMCRA
and 30 CFR Chapter VII and a timetable for enactment that is consistent with North Dakota's established administrative
or legislative procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 934, which codify decisions concerning the North Dakota program, are being
amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program
amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without
undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted
to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved
by OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In
the oversight of the North Dakota program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations and other materials
approved by OSM, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require
the enforcement by North Dakota of only such provisions.

VI. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

3. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

4. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving a proposed amendment to the North Dakota permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred to
as the ``North Dakota program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed
amendment consists of revisions to North Dakota's rules in the North Dakota Administrative Code (NDAC) pertaining
to preblasting survey requirements and the State's small operator assistance program. The amendment is intended
to revise the North Dakota program to be consistent with and incorporate the additional flexibility afforded by SMCRA
and the Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the North Dakota program as administered
by the North Dakota Public Service Commission (Commission). General background information on the North Dakota
program, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and an explanation of the conditions of approval of the North
Dakota program can be found in the December 15, 1980,

II. Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated October 22, 1993 (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;01), North Dakota submitted a proposed
amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. North Dakota submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative.
North Dakota proposed revisions to its performance standards pertaining to the use of explosives and preblasting
survey requirements at NADC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;17.02 (1) and (2). North Dakota also proposed revisions to its Small
Operator Assistance Program (SOAP) at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;01, responsibilities of the Commission;
NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02, program services; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03, eligibility for
assistance; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;04, filing for assistance; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;05,
application approval and notice of denial; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06, data requirements; NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;07,
assistance funding; and NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08, applicant liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to North Dakota's pre-blast survey and SOAP rules are meant to implement statutory changes to
the State's regulatory program pertaining to the use of explosives and SOAP that were enacted by the State legislature
in 1993. (For a document relating to the statutory revisions proposed by North Dakota for preblasting surveys and
small operator assistance, see an additional final rule 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice for the State of North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) North Dakota proposed the statutory and regulatory
amendments to its SOAP program in order to implement the changes to the Federal SOAP program at sections 507 (c) and
(h) of SMCRA made by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the November 23, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 61857), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;08). The public comment period ended on December
23, 1993. Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held.

III. Director's Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17,
finds that the proposed North Dakota program amendment as submitted by North Dakota on October 22, 1993, is not inconsistent
with and is no less stringent than SMCRA. Thus, the Director approves the proposed amendment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each operator shall notify in writing, at least thirty days before blasting, all residents and owners of manmade
dwellings or structures located within one mile *&blank;*&blank;* of the permit area how to request a preblasting
survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On request to the commission by a resident or owner of a dwelling or structure located within one mile *&blank;*&blank;*
of any part of the permit area, the operator shall promptly conduct a preblasting survey of the dwelling or structure
and promptly submit a report of the survey to the commission and requestor. Any preblasting survey requested more
than ten days before blasting must be completed before blasting is initiated. Additions or renovations to a surveyed
structure must be surveyed upon request to the commission.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this amendment, North Dakota proposed to increase from one-half mile [0.85 kilometers] to one mile [1.61 kilometers],
the distance from the permit area within which dwellings or structures must be situated before the owners or residents
of such dwellings and structures are entitled to the notice specified at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;17&hyph;02(1)
and can require the operator to conduct a pre-blast survey in accordance with NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;17&hyph;02(2).
North Dakota proposed these regulatory revisions in order to implement the statutory changes proposed by the State
in ``Amendment XVIII'' (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1, April 21, 1993) pertaining to pre-blast surveys.
(For a discussion of the proposed statutory provisions, see the additional final rule 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The distance standard in the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.62(a) and (b) regarding pre-blast surveys
is one-half mile of the permit area. North Dakota's proposed revisions at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02 (1)
and (2) would thus allow a potentially larger group of residents or owners within the vicinity of the mine to require
the operator to conduct a preblasting survey than is provided for by the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.62(a) and
(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion
to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations
that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory
authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining
and reclamation operations for which no Federal counterpart exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b)
dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations.
Therefore, the Director is approving the revisions proposed by North Dakota at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;17&hyph;02
(1) and (2).

In this amendment, North Dakota proposed several changes to its rules pertaining to its SOAP program in order to implement
the statutory revisions the State proposed in a separate amendment. (For a discussion of the proposed statutory SOAP
provisions, see the additional final rule notice for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) North Dakota
proposed these regulatory revisions in order to implement the statutory changes proposed by the State in ``Amendment
XVIII'' (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1, April 21, 1993).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;01(2) to provide that the Commission will develop
and maintain a list of ``qualified public or private entities'' as required by 30 CFR 795.10 and pay them for services
rendered. In this amendment, North Dakota proposed to substitute the phrase ``qualified public or private entities''
for the previous reference to ``qualified laboratories.'' North Dakota also proposed to change the term ``laboratory''
(or ``laboratories'') to ``public or private entity'' (or ``entities'') in its rules at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1),
69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;04(6)(b), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;05(1)(b), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06
(2) and (4), and 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Dakota's proposed terminology change is not inconsistent with section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA which provides that
the activities to be performed under SOAP shall be performed by a ``qualified pubic or private laboratory or such other
public or private qualified entity designated by the regulatory authority.'' Therefore, the Director finds that
the proposed terminology change at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;01(2), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1),
69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;04(6)(b), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;05(1)(b), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06
(2) and (4), and 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(b) is not inconsistent with section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA or the
Federal regulations regarding SOAP at 30 CFR Part 795, as recently revised (59 FR 28136, May 31, 1994), and the Director
is approving the proposed rules.

North Dakota proposed to expand its regulatory provisions governing SOAP program services at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1)
(a) and (b) in accordance with the statutory changes at North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37 (2)
through (5) proposed by the State in ``Amendment XVIII'' (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1, April 21,
1993). (For a discussion of the proposed statutory provisions, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published
elsewhere in this issue.) Specifically, North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1)
so that it will provide as follows:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To the extent possible with available funds, the commission will for qualified small operators who request assistance:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Select and pay a qualified public or private entity to perform the activities described under [NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)]
including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A determination of the probable hydrologic consequences of the mining and reclamation operations both on and off
the proposed permit area according to section 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The preparation of a statement of the results of test borings or core samplings according to section 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, as amended, NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1) (a) and (b) will provide coverage of all program services
detailed in North Dakota's statute at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State proposal is substantively similar to its Federal counterpart regulations at 30 CFR 795.9 (a), (b), (b)(1)
and (b)(2), as revised on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 28136), with one exception. While the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 795.9
(b)(1) through (b)(6) specifically identify each activity that may be funded pursuant to SOAP, the State proposal
specifically identifies only two activities that may be funded by SOAP. However, as noted above, the State proposal
does encompass all activities described under proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2). The activities described
under proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2), in turn, correspond to the activities described in the Federal program
at sections 507 (c)(1)(A) through (c)(1)(F) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 795.9 (b)(1) through (b)(6). (For a discussion of the
proposed statutory provision, see the additional final rule notice for North Dakota published elsewhere in this
issue.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director finds that proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1) (a) and (b) are no less stringent
than SMCRA and no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the corresponding Federal regulations. Accordingly,
the Director approves the proposed rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to revise the introductory text of NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(2) by increasing the
amount of probable total annual production allowed for SOAP applicants from one hundred thousand tons [90,718.47
metric tons] to three hundred thousand tons [272,155.41 metric tons]. The proposed change would make NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(2)
consistent with proposed statutory changes to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37 (see ``Amendment XVIII'' dated April
21, 1993, administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1), as well as the requirements of SMCRA at section 507(c)(1)
and the recently revised Federal counterpart regulation at 30 CFR 795.6(2). (For a discussion of the proposed statutory
provision, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) Therefore, the Director
is approving proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(2) (introductory text).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to create new NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5) to provide that an applicant is eligible
for SOAP assistance if, among other things:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[The applicant] will be required to pay reclamation fees under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5) is meant to implement the statutory provision of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5)
(see ``Amendment XVIII'' dated April 21, 1993, administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1). (For a discussion
of the proposed statutory provision, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Dakota's proposed limitation of SOAP assistance to operators required to pay reclamation fees under SMCRA
does not render NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5) inconsistent with SMCRA because section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA
only requires that SOAP assistance be made available to a qualified ``coal surface mining operator.'' As discussed
in the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue, the operators who will be deemed ineligible
for SOAP assistance under the North Dakota proposal would not qualify for such assistance under SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director notes that there is a typographical error in the SMCRA citation given in proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5).
That is, the reference to ``U.S.C. 1201 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

'' North Dakota's Attorney General, in a legal opinion dated October 1, 1993, and included with this proposed amendment,
noted the typographical error, but stated that the reference to the United States Code at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5)
should read ``30 U.S.C. 120

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Director finds North Dakota's proposed rule at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5) is not inconsistent
with SMCRA and the Director is approving it with the understanding that North Dakota will revise the aforementioned
typographical error so that the correct citation to SMCRA is referenced.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The commission will determine the minimum data collection requirements for each applicant or group of applicants.
Data collection and analysis may proceed concurrently with the development of mining and reclamation plans. The
data requirements will be based on:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The extent of currently available hydrologic, geologic, and other information described under [NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)].

In this amendment, North Dakota proposed to expand the basis upon which the requirements will be based, as outlined
at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06(1)(a). Specifically, as proposed, NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06(1)(a)
will now require that the data requirements be based upon all information described at proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2).
(For a discussion of the proposed statutory provision, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere
in this issue.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06(1)(a) is consistent with the recently revised Federal regulation
at 30 CFR 795.9(b), which lists the specific technical services authorized for the SOAP and provides, among other
things, that ``[t]he program administrator shall determine the data needed for each applicant or group of applicants.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Director finds that NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06(1)(a) is consistent with and no less effective

North Dakota proposed to delete the portion of NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;07(1) that prohibits the use of SOAP
funds to cover the costs of test boring or core sampling. The proposed revision is consistent with section 507(c)(1)(C)
of SMCRA and the recently revised Federal counterpart regulation at 30 CFR 795.9(b)(2), which allow the use of SOAP
funds to cover the cost of geologic drilling and statement of results of test borings and core samplings required by
section 507(b)(15) of SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director is approving the proposed revision at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;07(1).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(h) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 795.12(a) require, under specified circumstances, that a small operator reimburse
the regulatory authority for the cost of all SOAP services, which, in accordance with section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA,
includes the cost of training assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By comparison, North Dakota's proposed statutory change at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4), proposed by the State
in ``Amendment XVIII'' did not include training costs as an obligation for reimbursement by the operator. (For a discussion
of the proposed statutory provision, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue).
Moreover, the proposed introductory text to NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08 only refers to ``services rendered
under [NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29]'' which do not include training assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as discussed in the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue, section 507(c)(2)
of SMCRA specifically references only ``the Secretary.'' OSM currently interprets ``the Secretary'' to mean the
Secretary of the Interior, and not State regulatory authorities. Therefore, at the current time North Dakota is not
obligated to provide training under SOAP. Accordingly, North Dakota's proposed introductory text at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08
is no less stringent than section 507(h) of SMCRA and no less effective than the recently revised Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 795.12(a)(2).

North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(a), (b), and (c) to require that the applicant
shall reimburse the Commission for the cost of all SOAP services rendered under the NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29 if
the applicant submits false information, the applicant fails to submit a permit application within one year after
receiving the approved report from the qualified public or private entity, or the applicant fails to mine after obtaining
the permit. North Dakota's proposed revision of its rules at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(a), (b), and
(c) are substantively similar to and no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the corresponding Federal

North Dakota also proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(d) to provide that the applicant shall
reimburse the Commission for the cost of all services provided under NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29 if the Commission
finds that the operator's actual and attributed annual coal production for all locations exceeds three hundred thousand
tons during the 12 months immediately following the date the operator is issued a surface coal mining and reclamation
permit. North Dakota proposed this revision of its rule in order to implement the proposed statutory provisions of
NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4) (see ``Amendment XVIII'' dated April 21, 1993, administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1).

Finally, North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(e) to provide that the applicant
shall reimburse the Commission for the cost of all services provided under NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29 if the applicant
sells, transfers, or assigns the permit to another person and the transferee's total actual and attributed production
exceeds the three hundred thousand tons [272,155.41 metric tons] annual production limit during any consecutive
twelve-month period of the remaining permit term, and that the applicant and successor are jointly and severally
obligated to reimburse the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(e) is more stringent than the recently revised corresponding
Federal regulation at 30 CFR 795.12(a)(3). North Dakota's provision serves to impose reimbursement liability based
upon the annual production rates for the entire term of the permit, whereas the Federal regulation only takes into
account the production rate for the twelve months 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
immediately following
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the date on which the permit was originally issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director finds that NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(e) is more stringent than the Federal
regulation at 30 CFR 795.12(a)(3). In accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory
authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining
and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Section
505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with
SMCRA or the Federal regulations. Accordingly, the Director is approving proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(e).

5. Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the above discussion, the Director finds that North Dakota's proposed revisions at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)
(a) through (e) are not inconsistent with section 507(h) or SMCRA and no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements
than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 795.12(a) (1) through (3) and is approving the proposed rules.

h. NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2), Small Operator Assistance_Applicant Liability_Good Faith Waiver
of Liability for Reimbursement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2) to limit the circumstances under which the
Commission can waive the reimbursement obligation of an operator who receives SOAP assistance. Prior to this amendment,
NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2) allowed the Commission to waive a SOAP applicant's obligation to reimburse
the Commission for assistance whenever it found that the applicant at all times acted in good faith. North Dakota now
proposes to limit the Commission's discretion by revising NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2) so that it provides
as follows:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The commission may waive the reimbursement obligation under the conditions described in [NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;08(1)
(b) and (c)] if it finds that the applicant at all times acted in good faith.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State regulations at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;08(1) (b) and (c) describe the following two situations that can
trigger an applicant's obligation for reimbursement of the cost of SOAP assistance:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
b. The applicant fails to submit a permit application within one year after receiving the approved report from the
qualified public or private entity [performing SOAP services].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The applicant fails to mine after obtaining a permit.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, under the State proposal, the commission may allow a ``good-faith waiver'' of a SOAP applicant's reimbursement
obligation only if the applicant's obligation was triggered by the situations described at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)
(b) or (c). No such good-faith waiver is allowed if the applicant's reimbursement obligation was triggered by something
other than those specified situations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 795.12(b) allows the program administrator [regulatory authority] to waive the
reimbursement obligation if he or she finds that the applicant at all times acted in good faith. Since waiver of the
applicant's reimbursement obligation is a matter left within the discretion of the State regulatory authority under
the current Federal regulations, North Dakota's proposed change at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(2) is not
inconsistent with the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 795.12(b). Therefore, the Director is approving the proposed
rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, no
hearing was held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Federal Agency Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on North Dakota's proposed amendment from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and various other Federal agencies
with an actual or potential interest in the North Dakota program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated November 10, 1993, the Bureau of Reclamation stated it had no comments on the proposed amendment (administrative
record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;04).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated November 16, 1993, the Soil Conservation Service stated it had no specific comments pertaining to
this amendment (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;06).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated November 19, 1993, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) stated that the amendment did
not conflict with any of MSHA's current regulations (30 CFR parts 0&hyph;199), and therefore, it had no comments concerning
the proposed changes (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;07).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By undated letter received November 29, 1993, the Bureau of Indian Affairs stated it had no objections to the proposed
amendment because it did not affect Indian lands (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;09).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated November 30, 1993, the Bureau of Mines stated it had no comments (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated December 1, 1993, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stated it did not anticipate any significant impacts
to fish and wildlife resources as a result of the proposed amendment and, therefore, did not have any substantive comments
to offer (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;11).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence and Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to solicit the written concurrence of EPA with respect
to those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under
the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or the clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). None of the revisions that North Dakota proposed to make in its rules pertain to air or water quality standards. However,
OSM still requested EPA's concurrence with the proposed amendment (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;03).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated November 10, 1993, EPA responded that it had no comments on the proposed amendment. EPA also stated
it did not believe that there would be any impacts to water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the
Clean Water Act (administrative record No. ND&hyph;T&hyph;05).

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed amendment as submitted by North Dakota on October
22, 1993. The Director approves the rules as proposed by North Dakota with the provision that they be promulgated in
identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public. Approval of these rules by the Director
does not prevent OSM from requiring North Dakota to make additional revisions to its program pending the promulgation
of final Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 795 to implement the changes to SMCRA, as amended, regarding the SOAP program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 934, codifying decisions concerning the North Dakota program, are being amended
to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

1. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12886 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

3. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

4. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Science Foundation's nonprocurement regulations are contained in chapter VI of title 45 of the Code
of Federal Regulations. This volume is republished as of October 1 each year. This rule makes clerical corrections,
deletes unnecessary provisions, corrects nomenclature, reassigns internal responsibilities to reflect organizational
and nomenclature changes, and changes addresses to reflect the Foundation's relocation so the 1994 volume will be
correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only change of any substance is deletion of two parts_``Procedures and criteria for resolving questions involving
moral character or loyalty of applicants for and holders of National Science Foundation Fellowships'' (Part 610)
and ``Fellowship Review Panel'' (Part 630). These were adopted because prior to 1988 section 15(c) of the National
Science Foundation Act NSF to obtain a loyalty oath and statement as to criminal convictions from persons receiving
NSF Fellowships. Those requirements were repealed by section 105(b) of the National Science Foundation Authorization
Act of 1988 (102 Stat. 2865, 2868) and implementing regulations are no longer needed.

Determinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I have determined, under the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12866, that this rule is not a significant regulatory
action requiring review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. I also certify, pursuant to the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;601&hyph;612, that none of the clerical corrections and
nomenclature and address changes made by this rule will have a significant economic impact on any small entities.
Finally, I have reviewed this rule in light of section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and certify for the National Science
Foundation that this rule meets the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b) of that order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a summary of the Commission's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

Summary of the Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. By this action, the Commission denies a request by Kenwood Communications Corporation (Kenwood) for reconsideration
of portions of the rules adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in this proceeding. These rules were adopted in response to the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act (TDDRA),
Pub. L. 102&hyph;556, and generally prohibit the manufacture and importation of radio scanners capable of receiving
cellular telephone communications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in ET Docket No. 93&hyph;1, 58 FR 25574, April 27, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In its Petition for Reconsideration, Kenwood raises three issues. First, it argues that the deadlines for complying
with the rules adopted in this proceeding should be extended. Second, it requests that scanners sold to Military Affiliate
Radio Service (MARS) and Civil Air Patrol (CAP) licensees be exempt from the regulations adopted in this proceeding.
Finally, it argues that the definition of ``readily altered by the user'' that was adopted in this proceeding should
include only scanners that can be modified ``quickly'' by ``non-technical'' consumers. There were no comments filed
in response to the Kenwood petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Implementation dates. Kenwood contends that the April 26, 1993, cutoff date for equipment authorization and the
April 26, 1994, cutoff date for manufacture and importation of scanners that do not comply with the new rules do not
provide sufficient time to design and build new products to replace those being prohibited. This short period of time
is, however, mandated by the TDDRA and reflects the position of Congress that reception of cellular communications
by means of scanning receivers is a serious problem that must be resolved expeditiously. Accordingly, we are denying
Kenwood's request for an extension of the cutoff dates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Exemption for equipment sold to MARS and CAP licensees. Kenwood states that it manufactures two-way transceivers
that are generally set up to operate only on frequencies available within a particular radio service. Kenwood indicates
that some of its transceivers are routinely modified at its factory to operate on additional frequencies, such as
those used by MARS and CAP licensees, in order to accommodate the needs of its customers. Kenwood states that these
factory modifications can result, incidentally, in the ability to scan cellular telephone frequencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. We see no reason why it is not possible to manufacture equipment to operate on MARS and CAP frequencies without resulting
in that equipment also having the capability to receive the cellular frequencies, since MARS and CAP frequencies
are far removed from the cellular frequencies. Consequently, we find that there is no technical justification for
exempting scanning equipment from the rules adopted in this proceeding based on its intended use by MARS or CAP licensees,
and we are denying Kenwood's request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The definition of ``readily altered by the user.'' Kenwood requests that we modify the definition of ``readily
altered by the user'' to include only devices that can be quickly modified by ``non-technical consumers.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. We believe that Kenwood's proposed definition would make it too easy to modify scanners. Most of the examples given
in our definition of scanners that can be ``readily altered by the user'' are modifications that perhaps could not
be done by ``non-technical consumers.'' Yet, they are examples of precisely the kind of easy modifications that we
believe the TDDRA was intended to prohibit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, we are rejecting Kenwood's request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In accordance with the above discussion and pursuant to the authority contained in Sections 4(i), 302 and 303 of
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications Act of 1934,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
it is ordered that the Petition for Reconsideration filed by Kenwood Communications Corporation is denied.

petitioned action may be warranted. To the maximum extent practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of
the receipt of the petition, and the finding is to be promptly published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the finding is positive, the Service also is required to commence a review of the status of the petitioned species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service announces a 90-day finding on a petition requesting the Service to list as endangered the southern Rocky
Mountain population of the ``western boreal toad'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bufo boreas boreas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and initiates a status review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A petition dated September 27, 1993, was received by the Service from the Biodiversity Legal Foundation and Dr. Peter
Hovingh on September 30, 1993. The petition requested that the southern Rocky Mountain population of the ``western
boreal toad'' be listed as endangered and that critical habitat be designated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act allows the Service to list distinct population segments of vertebrate fish and wildlife. Physical and climatic
characteristics of the Great Divide Basin separate boreal toads in the southern Rocky Mountains (New Mexico, Colorado,
and southeastern Wyoming) from populations in the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains of Utah to the west and the Wind River
and Salt River Ranges of Wyoming to the north. The Basin's hot, dry summers, lack of available water, and high desert
vegetation provide unsuitable habitat for the toad. Movement of toads between the southern Rocky Mountains and populations
in western Wyoming and eastern Utah is unlikely because of the great distance (>165 km (100 miles)) and harsh environment.
Because of this geographic isolation, possible genetic differentiation exists between toads in the southern Rocky
Mountains and the remainder of their range (Blair 1964, Hubbard 1972). Considering these factors, the Service believes
the southern Rocky Mountain population of the boreal toad is a distinct population segment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A status review was first initiated for the southern Rocky Mountain population of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. b. boreas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by a notice of review published January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554). At that time the population was designated as a category
2 candidate, meaning that more information was needed before a decision could be made as to whether this population
should be listed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boreal toads were once common throughout much of the higher elevations in Colorado (Burger and Bragg 1946, Smith et
al. 1965, Hammerson 1989) and in the Snowy and Sierra Madre Ranges of southeastern Wyoming (Baxter and Stone 1985).
Boreal toads were found at only three localities at the southern periphery of their range in the San Juan Mountains
of New Mexico; Lagunitas, Canjilon, and Trout Lakes (Campbell and Degenhardt 1971, Jones 1978, New Mexico Department
of Game and Fish 1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Declines in isolated demes were first documented in New Mexico in the mid-1980's (Woodward and Mitchell 1985, Carey
1987) and in Colorado and southern Wyoming from 1986 through 1988 (Corn et al. 1989). Boreal toads are listed as endangered
by the State of New Mexico and are thought to be extirpated (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 1988). Surveys conducted
in 1989 and 1993 revealed no populations at the three previously known San Juan Mountain locations in Rio Arriba County,
New Mexico (Charlie Painter, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, pers. comm., 1993). Carey (1993) also documented
the extirpation of 11 demes in the Elk and West Elk Mountains of west-central Colorado. Corn et al. (1989) found that
boreal toads were absent from 83 percent of locations in Colorado previously known to contain toads. Subsequent surveys
conducted by the Service and others in Colorado indicate that boreal toads continue to disappear from traditional
localities or are absent from locations that contain suitable habitat (Steve Corn, National Biological Survey,
unpubl. data, 1993; Hammerson 1989). No toad demes have been confirmed in Wyoming since 1987 (S. Corn, pers. comm.,
1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No single factor known to cause direct loss of boreal toads in the southern Rocky Mountain population appears to be
producing range-wide declines. Those factors that appear capable of affecting a population throughout all or most
of its range cannot currently be linked to the decline of the southern Rocky Mountain population of the boreal toad.
Low impact recreational activities such as hiking, camping, wildlife viewing, nonmotorized boating, and fishing
may occasionally disrupt breeding pairs or trample recently metamorphosed juveniles along shorelines (Campbell
1970). High impact resource management strategies such as timber and grazing may alter or cause the destruction of
boreal toad habitat. Other factors that may directly impact boreal toads are water retention projects, changes in
water availability, competition and predation by native and nonnative species, and fishery management activities.
State agencies have regulations to protect the southern Rocky Mountain population of the boreal toad from ``take,''
but these measures in general do nothing to protect the toad's habitat from degradation or to protect the toads from
other threats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Factors that may cause indirect loss of toads include acid rain, pollution, and ultraviolet radiation. The potential
effects of acid rain, pollution, ultraviolet radiation, and natural population fluctuations remain unknown and
may be working synergistically with other environmental or anthropogenic factors to cause declines in toad populations.
Carey (1987, 1993) indicated that the proximate cause of the widespread decline of boreal toads in northern New Mexico
and west-central Colorado was a result of infection by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aeromonas hydrophila
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 bacteria (red-leg disease). However, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A. hydrophila
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is common in the microfauna carried by amphibians, and it does not cause infection or death in healthy individuals.
As a result, toads likely were stressed by other adverse environmental factors, such as those mentioned above, and
later succumbed to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A. hydrophila
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 infection (Carey 1987).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described
in section 4(a)(1) of the Act. The five factors are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Diseases or predation;

D. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the threats discussed above, the Service believes that factors A, C, D, and E may apply to the southern Rocky
Mountain population of the boreal toad.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the threats
faced by this population. After reviewing the petition, references cited in the petition, and other available information
the Service finds that the petition presents substantial information indicating that listing the southern Rocky
Mountain population of the boreal toad as endangered may be warranted. Within 1 year from the date the petition was
received, a finding as to whether the petitioned action is warranted is required by Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners also requested that critical habitat be designated. If the 12-month finding determines that the
petitioned action to list the boreal toad is warranted, then the designation of critical habitat would be addressed
in the subsequent proposed rule. At that time the Service also would determine if it is appropriate to propose to list
the population as endangered or threatened.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 With the restructuring of the Federal-aid highway program due to enactment of the Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914), regulations for the administration and management
of activities undertaken with FHWA planning and research funds are updated to reflect the revised sources of, and
activities eligible for, such funds. In addition, the ISTEA allows the States more flexibility in managing and directing
federally funded research, development, and technology transfer (RD&amp;T) activities. This final rule includes
the ISTEA revisions and grants States this greater responsibility and flexibility for the management and oversight
of their RD&amp;T initiatives funded with FHWA planning and research funds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 21, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was published by the FHWA in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(58 FR 67510) to obtain comments from interested persons on proposed revisions to regulations for program approval
and authorization; conduct; and reporting of planning, research, development, and technology transfer activities
undertaken by States and their subrecipients, including metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), with FHWA
planning and research funds. The proposed revisions were necessary to reflect changes to Title 23, United States
Code, Highways, that resulted from enactment of the ISTEA. In addition, the FHWA proposed that States establish a
process for management of RD&amp;T activities undertaken with FHWA planning and research funds that would enable
States to exercise greater authority over such activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to administration of FHWA planning and research funded RD&amp;T activities, the final rule reflects
the FHWA's belief that its stewardship role should be one of concentrating more on the policies and procedures by which
States implement such activities than on project-specific approvals and oversight. This philosophy parallels
the administrative oversight procedures adopted for FHWA planning and research funded transportation planning
activities in earlier revisions to 23 CFR part 420, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart A in 1985 and 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISTEA instituted a number of substantive changes pertinent to transportation planning and RD&amp;T programs.
In addition to retitling it from Highway Planning and Research to State Planning and Research (SPR), the ISTEA: (1)
increased the set-aside of funds apportioned to States for SPR activities from 1.5 percent to 2 percent; (2) included
planning and RD&amp;T as eligible activities under the National Highway System (NHS) program and Surface Transportation
Program (STP); (3) permitted the use of certain funds made available under title 23, U.S.C., for intermodal transportation
planning and RD&amp;T; and (4) required the expenditure of 25 percent of a State's annual SPR funds for RD&amp;T activities,
unless the State certifies that it will use more than 75 percent for planning and the Secretary of Transportation (the
Secretary) accepts the certification. These legislative provisions are reflected in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thirty-one sets of comments were submitted to the docket in response to the NPRM; 28 from State transportation departments/agencies,
1 from a regional planning agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 from a professional association, and 1 from a Federal agency. The overwhelming majority of comments were in support
of the proposed revisions and the increased flexibility for State management of RD&amp;T activities. However, there
were some concerns regarding some of the specific revisions and the short deadline for compliance. Many of these concerns
were due to misunderstandings about existing requirements and not the proposed revisions. A summary of the comments,
their disposition, and the changes made to the rule follow.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One State, in which most research is conducted for the State by higher education institutions, stated that the proposed
regulation does not pertain to universities as subrecipients and recommended citing Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) Circular A&hyph;110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions
of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations,'' November, 19, 1993, for universities as
subrecipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While the State is the recipient of FHWA planning and research funds, Part 420 also applies to subawards to all categories
of subrecipients, including institutions of higher education. In accordance with standard OMB requirements, subawards
are to be administered in accordance with the procedures in the OMB Circular and corresponding agency implementing
regulations that apply to the type of agency receiving the subaward, whether or not specifically stated in the regulation.
To clarify what applies to administration of subawards to institutions of higher education, a new paragraph (o) has
been added to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;420.121 as discussed under the section-by-section analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested that the term ``State highway agency'' be changed to ``State transportation agency'' to
maintain consistent nomenclature and reflect reality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since most of the State agencies to which Federal-aid highway program funds are apportioned are no longer single purpose
highway agencies, the FHWA agrees that use of the term ``State transportation agency'' is more appropriate and has
made this change. However, 23 U.S.C. 302 requires that a State desiring to avail itself of the provisions of title 23,
U.S.C., have a suitably equipped and organized State 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 department's indirect costs. Therefore, a definition of State transportation agency (STA) has been added to &sect;420.103,
as discussed below under the section-by-section analysis, to distinguish a State

 One State commented that it is using a significant portion of its SPR funds for training, ``since the ISTEA language
which was supposed to have covered training was inadvertently left out of that Legislation.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ISTEA in fact continued the funding provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(23 U.S.C. 321) for training of State personnel although at a reduced level of funding. With the exception of a specific
type of training cited in 23 U.S.C. 307(c), FHWA planning and research funds may only be used for transportation planning
or RD&amp;T related training if the cost of the training is necessary, reasonable, and it benefits the purposes of
the grant or subgrant. General training of employees who are not working on grant funded activities is not an allowable
cost. This is consistent with OMB cost principles which are applicable to FHWA planning and research fund grants and
subgrants.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One State questioned the estimate of 2,100 burden hours, shown under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act in the NPRM,
for the 50 States to comply with the regulation and stated that it will take much more time to develop a procedures manual;
procedures for tracking activities, schedules, accomplishment, and fiscal commitments; and procedures to determine
the effectiveness of the implementation process, and the utilizations of the RD&amp;T output. The commenter indicated
that the State has many of the elements in place, but did not know if the FHWA Division office would accept them or require
revisions in content or format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The estimate of 2,100 burden-hours (40 hours per respondent) is for the one-time preparation by each State, the District
of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 required by subpart B of the regulation. Many of the other activities cited by the commenter are either required already
(e.g., progress reports) and are covered by the cited existing OMB clearances or are standard management practices
that the State should already have in place. An updated burden estimate has been prepared. It is estimated that the
average one-time burden for preparation of RD&amp;T management process documentation and certification statements
is 480 burden-hours (12 weeks x 40 hours per week) per State.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The authority citation has been amended from the NPRM to include 23 U.S.C. 303(g) which allows the use of NHS, STP, and
highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation (HBRR) funds for development and establishment of the management
and monitoring systems required under 23 U.S.C. 303. In addition, section 149(b) has been deleted since this regulation
does not apply to funds made available under this section of title 23, U.S.C.

Section 420.101&blank;Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section states the purpose of this regulation. It indicates that the provisions of this part apply to subrecipients
of States, including MPOs. Language has been added to indicate that it also applies to activities undertaken with
NHS, STP, and Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program (HBRRP) funds for development, establishment,
and implementation of the management and monitoring systems required by 23 U.S.C. 303 and 23 CFR part 500. Use of NHS
and STP funds for such purposes was included in the NPRM definition of FHWA planning and research funds; the use of HBRRP
funds is being added to the definition as discussed below. A reference to the additional requirements for RD&amp;T
programs and studies in subpart B of this part is included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 420.103&blank;Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes the terms defined in 23 U.S.C. 101(a) and contains additional definitions for terms used in
this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``FHWA planning and research funds'' includes SPR funds, metropolitan planning (PL) funds, and the optional
use of NHS, STP, and Minimum Allocation (MA) funds for planning and RD&amp;T purposes. It also includes the use of NHS,
STP, and HBRRP funds for development, establishment, and implementation of the management and monitoring systems
required by 23 U.S.C. 303. The definition has been amended from the NPRM to include funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C.
144 for the HBRRP when such funds are used for development, establishment, and implementation of the bridge management
system required by 23 U.S.C. 303. This category was inadvertently not included in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this rulemaking does not change the definition of grant, one commenter believed that new readers may not
be familiar with the difference between a contract and a grant and, therefore, suggested that a definition of grant
be included to reduce confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA agrees and has added definitions of ``grant agreement'' and ``procurement contract.'' These mechanisms
for agencies to make awards to recipients are adaptations of definitions in Chapter 63, Using Procurement Contracts
and Grant and Cooperative Agreements, of title 31, CFR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``grant agreement'' is defined as a legal instrument between an awarding agency and recipient where the principal
purpose is to provide funds to the recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by law.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``procurement contract'' is defined as a legal instrument between an awarding agency and recipient where the principal
purpose is to acquire (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or use of the awarding
agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For administrative purposes, it is important to note that the purpose of the award determines whether the award is
a grant or a procurement action. The administrative procedures for grants are governed by OMB Circulars A&hyph;102
and A&hyph;110 and agency implementing regulations. The administrative procedures for procurement contracts
are governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR Part 31) or State procedures if the recipient is a State.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since FHWA planning and research funds may be pooled for planning, as well as RD&amp;T, studies or activities of national
or regional significance, the definitions of national and regional pooled-fund studies have been moved from &sect;420.203
to &sect;420.103. In addition, both definitions have been modified to indicate: that MPOs, as well as States, may
contribute to pooled-fund studies; that national studies are usually administered by the FHWA headquarters office;
that regional studies are usually administered by an FHWA regional office in cooperation with a lead State or MPO;
and that the funds may be pooled with or without matching. While any of the categories of funds included in the definition
of ``FHWA planning and research funds'' may be pooled, the matching requirement can only be waived for SPR or PL funds.
Such waiver must be approved by FHWA headquarters for both national and regional studies in accordance with the provisions
of &sect;420.119(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed under the general comments and responses, a definition of State transportation agency has been added.
``State transportation agency (STA)'' is defined as the State highway department, transportation department,
or other State transportation agency to which Federal-aid highway funds are apportioned.

Section 420.105&blank;Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section continues the FHWA's previous policy of allowing States maximum possible flexibility in determining
which eligible activities may be undertaken with FHWA planning and research funds, as long as planning activities
of national significance, as identified in paragraph (b) of this section, are being adequately addressed. Under
the provisions of this section, the FHWA may withhold or withdraw authorization of FHWA planning and research funds
if planning activities of national significance are not being performed by a State. As discussed in the preamble to
the NPRM, this policy also applies to State subrecipients. Paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) in the NPRM have been rewritten
and consolidated for clarity into paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) in the rule without changing the substance of the policy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter expressed concern about the potential involvement in long range data reporting requirements that
would make unexpected demands on its manpower in order to provide data that support FHWA responsibilities as specified
in &sect;420.105(b). The commenter indicated that clarification was needed on this requirement. Another commenter
indicated that States should have the right to question the need for particular data requests from the FHWA if the cost
of providing such data becomes high. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision has been in the regulation since 1986. The major data bases that are referenced in &sect;420.105(b)
are the FHWA's Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) and statistical reports provided by the States for inclusion
in the annual publication ``Highway Statistics.'' Both of these data collection activities have been approved by
the OMB and are resubmitted for approval every three years. Occasionally, information not included in these ongoing
data bases is needed due to special circumstances and enactment of legislation, such as, designation of a National
Highway System in accordance the provisions of the ISTEA. With each update of the HPMS and highway statistics reporting
requirements and with each special request, the FHWA will continue to make every effort possible to limit the burden
to the States while still receiving the information essential to guide the national transportation program.

Section 420.107&blank;SPR Minimum Research, Development, and Technology Transfer Expenditure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section reflects the requirement in 23 U.S.C. 307(c) that not less than 25 percent of a State's annual SPR funds
be expended for RD&amp;T activities unless the State certifies that it will expend more than 75 percent of such funds
for transportation planning under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 135. It includes specific procedures and criteria for FHWA approval
of a State's certification that were in the FHWA Executive Director's June 25, 1992, memorandum to the FHWA Regional
Administrators. (This memorandum is available for review and copying in the file for FHWA docket number 93&hyph;18
at the address specified above under the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) The certification must be submitted annually with the work program or with the request for authorization of funds
for the second year of a biennial work program. Except for rephrasing of the considerations in paragraphs (c)(1) to
(6) to change them from questions to statements, this section is unchanged from the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters expressed concern over the criteria and procedures in &sect;420.107 for waiver of the requirement
for use of 25 percent of a State's annual apportionment of SPR funds. One commenter stated that the proposed rules go
far beyond what should be necessary to support such a certification and that it appears that the FHWA is unduly striving
to discourage this option. This commenter recommended that the requirements be reduced to an assurance that the State's
RD&amp;T needs are being adequately addressed. Similarly, other commenters stated that the requirements for submitting
an exception to the use of 25 percent of SPR fund for research are onerous and effectively prohibit exceptions as they
are currently written or that the proposed rule indicates that the FHWA will be reluctant to grant exceptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While 23 U.S.C. 307(c)(2) requires that a State certify to the Secretary that its total expenditures for transportation
planning under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 135 for the fiscal year will exceed 75 percent, it also requires that the certification
be accepted by the Secretary. Based on the extensive provisions and emphasis on transportation RD&amp;T in the ISTEA,
the FHWA strongly believes that the Congress intended that the States have effective transportation RD&amp;T programs.
Therefore, the criteria for approving an exception are being retained.

Section 420.109&blank;Distribution of PL Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section reflects the requirements in 23 U.S.C. 104 that a State must make apportioned PL funds available to MPOs
and that the funds must be distributed by the State to MPOs in the State based on a formula, approved by the Secretary
(approval authority has been delegated to the FHWA), that considers population, status of planning, attainment
of national ambient air quality standards, and other factors necessary to provide for an appropriate distribution
of funds to carry out the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134 and other applicable requirements of Federal law. The FHWA's
longstanding interpretation, that the legislative requirement that States make PL funds available to MPOs precludes
the use of such funds by the State for administration of PL grants or subgrants, is included in paragraph (a). It is FHWA
policy to consult with the appropriate Federal Transit Administration (FTA) regional office prior to approval of
a State's PL formula.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One State commented that the requirement in paragraph (a) that ``the State shall not use any PL funds for grant or subgrant
administration'' is too restrictive and should be changed to permit a reasonable amount for administration. Another
State commented that under the ISTEA, a State DOT's role in administering and participating in MPO planning activities
funded with PL funds has increased significantly and that there should be a provision which permits the State DOT to
retain a certain percentage of PL funds for its costs in administering and participating in PL funded programs. Another
State commented: that the cost for grant administration historically has been included as part of the funding package
of the MPO planning work program; that this new provision may unfairly restrict the use of PL funds to only direct program
activity and not permit the State or MPO to use PL funds for organization administration costs; and that by not allowing
the use of PL funds for grant or subgrant administration, the FHWA will be placing an unfair economic burden on the various
parties concerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These comments imply a misunderstanding of both the legislation and regulation. Before responding to these comments,
a distinction needs to be made between ``grant or subgrant administration'' and ``general planning process administrative
activities.'' ``Grant or subgrant administration'' includes activities such as processing or preparing PL grant
agreements between the FHWA and the State, subgrant agreements between the State and the MPOs, fiscal documents,
progress reports, and audits. ``General planning process administrative activities'' may include conducting
MPO meetings, preparation of planning work programs, and salaries of an MPO executive director and other administrative
support staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislation has always specified that PL funds are to be made available 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
to the MPOs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by the State. The FHWA historically has interpreted this to mean that a State cannot unilaterally retain PL funds for
any purpose; all PL funds must be made available to the MPOs. If an individual MPO chooses to include activities (e.g.,
development of a long range plan, traffic counting) to be performed with its PL funds by the State for the MPO in its work
program, it may do so. If the required State PL fund distribution formula, developed in consultation with the MPOs,
allows for State retainage of PL funds, it may be approved by the FHWA if the retained funds will be used by the State for

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
technical activities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in support of metropolitan planning or for making discretionary subgrants to MPOs for special studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In no instance may PL funds (either in an MPO's work program or retained under an approved formula) be used by a State
for PL fund ``grant or subgrant administration'' as indicated in subparagraph (a). Such State grant or subgrant administrative
activities are eligible for SPR funding. ``General planning process administrative activities'' performed by
MPOs are eligible for PL funds. Such general administrative activities performed by a State for an MPO are eligible
for SPR funds and would be eligible for PL funds if included in the MPO's work program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One State commented that it would be concerned if the regulation is administratively construed to require a specific
formula for distribution, or require reconsideration of its policy on PL funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement that funds be distributed by a State by a formula that considers specific factors has existed since
the enactment of the PL funding in 1973. The ISTEA added the additional factor of attainment of the national ambient
air quality standards. In developing the formula, the State must consult with the MPOs and must consider the legislatively
mandated factors, but all of the factors do not need to be included in the formula. In accordance with paragraph (f),
any formula that does not meet these requirements must be brought into conformance as soon as possible, but not later
than in time for distribution of PL funds apportioned to the State for the first Federal fiscal year beginning after
the effective date of the regulation.

This section includes requirements for State and subrecipient work programs that serve as the application for FHWA
planning and research funds. References to 23 CFR part 450 and subpart B of this part are cited for additional information
on metropolitan area unified planning work programs and RD&amp;T work programs, respectively. Except for correcting
citations to 23 CFR part 450 and changing the first word in paragraph (a) from ``expenditure'' to ``proposed use,''
this section is unchanged from the NPRM. The work program in essence is a statement of work that identifies the proposed
use of the funds; expenditure of the funds is documented in the financial and progress reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the requirement to submit work program documents creates duplicate paperwork for agencies.
The commenter stated that the same information is available in work plans for individual studies, and, if FHWA review
of individual study work plans is no longer required, submission of a work program is not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A work program has always been required for both planning and RD&amp;T activities. The work program is the ``grant
application'' for FHWA planning and research funds and is necessary for the FHWA to determine if the proposed work
is eligible. A work program may consist of a listing of proposed studies and activities and other appropriate information,
such as cost of the activity and performing agency, with sufficient description for the FHWA to determine eligibility
of the work. ``Work plans'' that included details on need, purpose, approach, etc., for individual RD&amp;T studies
are no longer required. Therefore, there is no duplication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

which may be difficult to make on a biennial basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Historically, the amount of FHWA planning and research funds available to a State is consistent from year to year over
the period covered by authorizing legislation (e.g., the ISTEA). In any case, if a State's or subrecipient's transportation
planning is a continuation of the same activities with minimal change in activities over an extended period, use of
a 2-year work program should result in a significant reduction in paperwork since draft and final work programs would
not need to be prepared and submitted for review and approval in the second year unless significant changes are necessary
in the description of work. The initial work program would describe the activities anticipated to be accomplished
over the 2-year period along with an estimate of funds for each year. The FHWA would approve the 2-year work program
and authorize the first year's work subject to availability of funds. Prior to the beginning of the second year, when
the actual amount of funds that will be available is known, the State would only need to submit a request to revise the
budget to reflect the actual funds available (and if necessary any significant amendments in the description of work
to be accomplished) for the second year and request the FHWA's authorization to proceed with the second year's work.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes general criteria and incorporates by reference other regulations and OMB Circulars for determining
eligibility of transportation planning and RD&amp;T activities and allowability of items of cost (e.g., salaries,
travel) within such activities that are proposed for FHWA planning and research funds. Administrative procedures
that must be followed for costs to be eligible for reimbursement are also included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that a list of examples of transportation planning and RD&amp;T activities that are eligible
for FHWA planning and research funds be included in the final rule. Appropriate sections of title 23, U.S.C., that
include information on broad categories of eligible activities are included by reference. The FHWA believes that
any attempt to provide a more specific listing could be misinterpreted since all eligible activities could not possibly
be listed. The longstanding practice of allowing the FHWA field offices to determine eligible activities, in consultation
with the headquarters office if necessary, has worked well in the past and will be continued. In addition, the FHWA
headquarters office will continue to issue appropriate guidance when necessary on the eligibility of specific types
of activities. For example, in response to several inquiries since enactment of the ISTEA, guidance has been provided
on the use of FHWA planning and research funds for transportation planning involving modes in addition to highway
or transit. As discussed in the preamble to the NPRM, transportation planning studies involving modes in addition
to highway or transit are eligible for FHWA planning and research funds when performed as part of the statewide or metropolitan
transportation planning processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to questions regarding eligibility of travel costs of team members conducting peer reviews of a State's
RD&amp;T management process, subpart B has been revised, as discussed below under the responses to comments on subpart
B, to specify that such travel costs are eligible for FHWA planning and research funds. While not required by this regulation
or 23 CFR part 450, similar peer reviews of statewide and metropolitan transportation planning processes would also
be eligible if included in a State or MPO transportation planning work program and it is determined by the FHWA that
the costs are necessary, reasonable, and benefit the FHWA planning and research funded transportation planning
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of this section in the NPRM referenced the provisions of 23 CFR part 140, subpart G on the allowability
of indirect costs of STA planning and research units. The allowability of such costs for any STA unit that performs
work for development, establishment, and implementation of the management and monitoring systems required under
23 U.S.C. 303 was addressed in a May 3, 1994, memorandum to the FHWA and FTA Regional Administrators. (This memorandum
is available for review and copying in the file for FHWA docket number 93&hyph;18 at the address specified above under
the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) To more clearly identify such allowable indirect costs, the reference to 23 CFR part 140, subpart G has been replaced
with the specific provisions and information provided in the May 3 memorandum. In accordance with longstanding FHWA
interpretation of 23 U.S.C. 302, except as specified in new paragraph (b)(2) of &sect;420.113, STA indirect costs
are not eligible for reimbursement with FHWA planning and research funds. Paragraph (b)(2) specifies that salaries,
but not other indirect costs, for services rendered by STA employees generally classified as administrative are
eligible for reimbursement for a transportation planning unit, RD&amp;T unit, or other unit performing eligible
work with FHWA planning and research funds (including development, establishment, and implementation of the management
and monitoring systems required by 23 U.S.C. 303 and 23 CFR part 500). Such STA administrative costs are allowable
in the ratio of time spent on the FHWA planning and research funded work in the unit to the total unit's working hours.
The FHWA is currently conducting a review of its longstanding policy on eligibility of STA indirect costs and, if necessary
based on the results of this review, the provisions in this section will be amended.

This section includes procedures for approval of work programs or projects, and amendments thereto, and authorization
for work to be performed with FHWA planning and research funds. The governmentwide common grant management provisions
for prior awarding agency approval of certain budget and programmatic changes are referenced at 49 CFR 18.30. While
executed project agreements are still necessary, the language in paragraph (c) was revised to eliminate reference
to forms PR&hyph;2 and PR&hyph;2A since these forms are currently being revised and the form numbers may change.

Several commenters believe that the requirement for prior FHWA approval for budget and programmatic changes as specified
in 49 CFR 18.30 is contrary to the intent of giving States more responsibility and authority. Some commenters also
recommended that, after receiving initial FHWA approval of the work programs, additional FHWA approval should only
be sought when a budget revision means additional Federal funds are required. One commenter suggested that FHWA approval
be sought only when a budget revision exceeds the limits of $10,000 and 15 percent of a research study cost as specified
in 23 CFR 511.3(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of these comments reflect a misunderstanding of the provisions of 49 CFR 18.30 which are governmentwide common
grant management provisions that have been applicable to FHWA planning and research funded work programs since revision
of OMB Circular A&hyph;102 in 1988 and issuance of 49 CFR part 18. These provisions were included in 23 CFR part 420 in
the 1990 update and are unchanged in this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limit of $10,000 and 15 percent under 23 CFR 511.3(e), applies to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
individual
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RD&amp;T studies; for example, a cost increase of greater than $15,000 for a $100,000 study would require prior approval.
Under the provisions of 49 CFR 18.30(c)(1)(ii), the State may make budget transfers among direct cost categories
(e.g., individual RD&amp;T studies) without FHWA prior approval unless the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
total 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of such transfers over the period of the work program will, or is expected to, exceed the larger of $100,000 or 10 percent
of the total approved (i.e., work program) budget. For example, if an RD&amp;T work program totals $2 million, the
State may transfer $200,000 among direct cost line items included in the work program without prior FHWA approval.
At the discretion of the FHWA, this prior approval requirement may be waived. Thus the use of the provisions of 49 CFR
18.30 provide more flexibility and authority to the State than the provisions that are being replaced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, a budget change that involves an increase in the total funds authorized for the work program still
requires prior FHWA approval and authorization. Similarly, the programmatic changes (e.g., adding a line item,
contracting out) specified in 49 CFR 18.30(d) require prior FHWA approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter interpreted the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to imply that the State can impose
obligation limitations on subrecipients of the PL funds and requested that it be clarified to indicate that such limits
can indeed be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of these paragraphs are not new and are not related to the issue of distribution of available obligation
authority within a State. These provisions allow work to proceed and be reimbursed at a later date in situations where
sufficient funds or obligation authority are not available at the time authorization is requested for all work in
a statewide or metropolitan area work program. Obligation authority is distributed to the States for use by the States
as determined in cooperation with the FHWA field offices. In general, neither legislation nor the FHWA specifies
categories of funds for which the States must use the obligation authority. States may choose to request authorization
of only a portion of the PL funds needed for a work program period, but would then need to ensure that additional funds
are requested and authorized prior to the MPO proceeding with the remainder of the work program. Such partial funding
necessitates processing of project amendments and additional paperwork. It also could result in an MPO performing
work that would be ineligible for reimbursement if the work is performed prior to approval of the amendment. Such partial
funding should be avoided if possible.

Section 420.117&blank;Program Monitoring and Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes grant monitoring and reporting requirements. The frequency and content of progress and financial
reports specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) are identical to those contained in the governmentwide common grant
management requirements and 49 CFR 18.40 which is referenced in paragraph (a). Paragraph (e) requires FHWA approval
prior to publication of reports that document the results of work performed with FHWA planning and research funds.
A State may request waiver of this prior approval requirement. The reference to the Federal-aid Project Agreement
(Form PR&hyph;2) in the first sentence of paragraph (e) has been deleted since Form PR&hyph;2 is being revised and
the contents of the cited provision for prior approval of reports are included in this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters believe that these reporting requirements are contrary to the concept of delegation of program
management responsibility to the State which should be allowed to determine how to monitor its research program;
FHWA review and approval should be limited to assurance that an adequate monitoring process is in place and is being
used to guide the State's program; and, if a State truly has responsibility for managing its own program, the State
should determine the needed frequency of reporting for adequately monitoring projects. Another commenter recommended
that an annual report should be adequate and that the reporting format should be kept simple. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These grant reporting requirements are not new and are standard governmentwide grant reporting requirements that
replaced more comprehensive requirements that were in 23 CFR part 420 prior to 1990. These reports are necessary for
the FHWA to perform its grant oversight responsibilities. Progress and financial reports that include the specified
information must be submitted at least annually. The FHWA field offices may require more frequent reports, but not
more than quarterly, unless the State is determined to be a high-risk grantee in accordance with the provisions of
49 CFR 18.12. The reporting requirements are for the work program (i.e., grant), not for individual ``projects/studies.''
The progress reports previously required in 23 CFR part 511 for individual research studies are no longer required.
Progress on individual studies would be addressed in the overall work program report. A State may establish additional
reporting procedures that meet its needs for individual studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, another commenter stated that &sect;420.117 requires an increased level of reporting activity and that
the interpretation and administration of this section could produce some very demanding requirements. This commenter
also questioned who would establish and approve performance goals, and what level of detail would be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, this section is unchanged from the existing regulation and does not require increased reporting.
The level of reporting will only be greater for a State or subrecipient if the State or subrecipient was not in compliance
with the existing requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended that the reporting provisions be flexible enough to allow monthly reports if agreed to
by the agency and the subrecipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned above, the FHWA may require more frequent reports, but may not require submission of reports more than
quarterly unless a recipient or subrecipient is determined to be a high risk. A State may establish the frequency of
progress and financial reports for its subgrantees, but is encouraged not to impose more burdensome requirements
than those imposed upon the State by the FHWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the requirement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;420.117(c) that reports from subrecipients be submitted no more than 90 days after the end of the reporting
period does not allow sufficient time to complete the audit of the work program, especially when the MPO has elected
a 2-year cycle for the audit to be performed. It was suggested that the 90-day requirement be deleted and the timeframe
be determined by the State with approval of the FHWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter is confusing grant audit requirements with grant reporting requirements. In accordance with governmentwide
common grant management requirements, final progress and financial reports for a grant (i.e., the annual/biennial
work program) must be submitted within 90 days of the end of the grant period. If the later financial audit, which covers
the MPO's fiscal year and typically is not completed until a year after the end of the grant period, necessitates adjustments,
the grant may be reopened or adjustment may be made to a current grant, as appropriate. With regard to the statement
that an MPO has been operating under a 2-year cycle for financial audits, in accordance with the OMB Circular A&hyph;128,
Single Audits of State and Local Governments, audits must be performed annually unless a constitutional or statutory
requirement for less frequent audit was in effect by January 1, 1987. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the requirement that a State must request a waiver of prior approval of report publication
is an unnecessary and demeaning retention of FHWA authority; the State should have sole responsibility and authority
to publish reports that follow accepted editorial formatting for electronic data base management and retrieval
purposes; and the use of a report as evidence of work performed and approval for publication are two separate issues
and should not be combined. Another commenter stated that FHWA approval of reports prior to publication is inconsistent
with the intent of allowing States flexibility in managing their own programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to ``editorial formatting,'' the FHWA does not review reports for this purpose. The FHWA agrees that
the use of a report as evidence of work performed and approval for publication are two separate issues, but does not
agree that they should not be combined. This comment implies that the report should be submitted to the FHWA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
after 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
publication for acceptance as evidence of work performed. In addition to determining if the proposed work that was
approved as part of the grant was performed, the FHWA should have an opportunity to determine if the contents of the
report are supported by the work performed since the published report will include a credit reference to the FHWA.
Also, submission prior to publication allows a State to use FHWA expertise, if desired, to identify any necessary
technical corrections prior to publication and distribution. If, based on past performance, an FHWA field office
is satisfied that prior review is unnecessary and a State requests a waiver of the prior review requirement, the field
office may grant the waiver for all reports or for selected categories (e.g., State planning, MPO planning, all research,
or bridge research). A waiver may be granted for an indefinite period of time, annually, or any other appropriate period.
Whether or not a waiver is approved, appropriate reports that document work performed with FHWA planning and research
funds must be prepared, the reports must include a credit reference and disclaimer statement, and copies must be provided
to the FHWA as evidence of work performed.

Section 420.119&blank;Fiscal Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes fiscal requirements for administration, matching, and payment for FHWA planning and research
funds. Paragraph (c) specifies that the statewide and, if appropriate, metropolitan transportation improvement
program provisions of 23 CFR Part 450 need to be met for the use of NHS, STP, MA, or HBRRP funds for planning or RD&amp;T
purposes. Paragraph (d) includes provisions for waiver of matching requirements for SPR and PL funds (this option
is not applicable for optional use of STP, NHS, MA, or HBRRP funds for planning or RD&amp;T activities). If the FHWA
determines that the interests of the Federal-aid program would be best served without matching, it may waive the matching
requirement for individual activities or regional or national pooled-fund studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters stated that authority to approve 100 percent Federal funding should be delegated to the FHWA regional
offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approval authority for 100 percent Federal funding will remain with the Associate Administrator for Program
Development (for planning activities) and the Associate Administrator for Research and Development (for RD&amp;T
activities) since these offices are in the best position to determine whether the interests of the Federal-aid highway
program would be best served and whether the proposed work can be more effectively addressed if the matching requirement
is waived.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that limiting the cost to a minimum of $50,000 for cooperatively (pooled) funded projects
and requiring an agency's contribution to be at least $10,000 were inappropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to administrative costs and the time involved in coordinating pooled-fund studies, proposed national studies
costing less than $50,000 will not be accepted. In response to the comments, the minimum agency contribution of $10,000
has been deleted. Agencies contributing less than $10,000 to a national pooled-fund study may participate in the
technical committee meetings, but will not be reimbursed from the pooled funds for their expenses to attend the meetings.
At the discretion of the FHWA regional offices and participating agencies, regional pooled-fund studies of less
than $50,000 may be undertaken and travel costs may be reimbursed from the regional pooled funds for expenses for attendance
at technical committee meetings of representatives of agencies that contribute less than $10,000.

Section 420.121&blank;Other Requirements

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains, mostly by cross reference, other legislative or regulatory requirements applicable to FHWA
planning and research fund grants. Except as noted below, this section is unchanged from the NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to paragraph (d), one commenter stated that it appears that the regulation does not differ from present
procedures with respect to the acquisition of research equipment. It was suggested that more latitude be given to
the States for the purchase of research equipment with SPR funds when the equipment will clearly be devoted to research
at a facility largely supported by SPR funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with governmentwide grant management procedures and cost principles, equipment is eligible if the
cost is necessary, reasonable, and it benefits the grant. Individual items of equipment must be identified in the
grant application (i.e., the work program) and will be reviewed for eligibility on a case-by-case basis. In general,
if the equipment will be used only for FHWA funded work, all of the cost may be eligible. If the equipment will be used
for work funded by other sources, the cost should be shared on an equitable basis or through the establishment of rental/use
rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above under the heading General Comments and Responses, paragraph (o) has been added to this section. This
new paragraph specifies that subawards to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations
will be administered by the State in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 (58 FR 62992) and the
U.S. DOT's implementing regulations, 49 CFR part 19 (59 FR 15657). (Copies of OMB Circular A&hyph;110 and 49 CFR part

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the State's responsibility to initiate a peer review of its RD&amp;T management process. An initial peer review
should be undertaken sometime during the first three years after the State's management process has been approved
by the FHWA Division Office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The peer review is intended to review a State's management process, not the content of its RD&amp;T program. It will
not be used for compliance or certification. Peer reviews should help in identifying, reinforcing, and conveying
effective program approaches across the country and enable a nationwide sharing of successful practices and policies.
The purpose of providing the peer review report and a written response to the report findings to the FHWA Division Administrator
is primarily to keep the Division Administrator informed of the status of the State's program and what efforts are
being taken to improve the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The members of the peer review team will be selected by the State. The FHWA will establish criteria for team members
and will develop and maintain a list of qualified individuals who will be available to serve on the teams. At least two
members of the peer review team must be selected from this list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A State may include a line item in its work program to pay for the peer review of its RD&amp;T program with FHWA planning
and research funds. The FHWA will consider establishing a national pooled-fund project if there is sufficient interest
from the States and if it would expedite the peer review process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``periodic basis'' for conducting peer reviews has been determined by the FHWA to be once every three years. After
experience has been gained operating under the new procedures, consideration will be given to extending the time
period between reviews.

The option to submit individual studies for Federal approval (i.e., to continue operating under current procedures)
has not been included in the final rule. The regulations are mandatory for all States. The final regulation provides
a State with considerable latitude in developing and managing its RD&amp;T activities and supports the intent of
ISTEA to move the decisionmaking process to the State level.

One commenter stated that the FHWA's intent concerning the degree of RD&amp;T program interaction within State agencies
should be more clearly stated. Specifically, expectations regarding the degree of management involvement at various
organizational levels should be disclosed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Due to the different organizational structures of the States, it is not possible to be specific concerning the degree
of management involvement. Each State should involve those management levels that are necessary to develop and implement
an RD&amp;T program that addresses high priority transportation issues.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the NPRM implies that the FHWA is going to require a uniform format for State work programs
since the information will be entered into a national data base.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no intent to require a uniform work program format. The FHWA will encourage the States to include summary sheets
listing all studies and costs followed by more detailed information on individual studies in their work programs.
Also, as part of its management process, each State is required to use the Transportation Research Board's Transportation
Research Information Services (TRIS) for reporting its active RD&amp;T activities. It will be the State's responsibility
to enter its new RD&amp;T activities into the TRIS data base. Since uniform entries will be required for the data base,
it could reasonably result in the States' work programs becoming more uniform to simplify data entry.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters expressed concern about the requirement that each State implement a program of RD&amp;T activities
for planning, design, construction, and maintenance of highways, public transportation, and intermodal transportation
systems. The concerns were that the budgets for the smaller States are not sufficient to support activities in all
of these areas; the FHWA is requiring the States to set up separate groups of funding for highway, transit, and intermodal
research; and the term ``program of RD&amp;T activities'' is not defined.

allows
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the use of FHWA planning and research funds for RD&amp;T activities noted in &sect;420.207. The regulation reflects
the types of activities that may be conducted, but does not mandate that particular types be conducted. Each State
is to develop a program that addresses its highest priority transportation research needs. The priorities will vary
from State to State depending on such factors as the size of the State, its population, and the size and number of urban
areas. This regulation does not establish separate groups of funds for highway, transit, or intermodal research.

 Initially, for some States, it may require additional effort to document the State's RD&amp;T management process.
Once the management process has been documented and approved by the FHWA the amount of paperwork between the State
and the FHWA should be reduced substantially. Paperwork on individual RD&amp;T activities essentially will be eliminated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Guidelines for implementing subpart B are being developed. These guidelines will expand on the requirements in &sect;420.207.
As a minimum, a State should develop a follow-up procedure to determine if the RD&amp;T results have been incorporated
into the State's standard plans, specifications, practices, or procedures. A more detailed process could involve
benefit/cost ratios or other effectiveness measures.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that to list individual studies in the work program reduced the State's ability to be responsive
to research needs as they arise during the year. According to the commenter this will cause a delay in the start of new
research by having to wait for the next program approval or for approval of an amended program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A listing of individual studies in the work program is necessary for the FHWA Division Office to determine if the items
are eligible for FHWA planning and research funds. Addition or deletion of individual studies is a programmatic change
that requires prior FHWA approval. Such prior approval may be waived by the FHWA division office; however, the total
FHWA planning and research funds authorized for the work program cannot be exceeded without FHWA prior authorization.
It is anticipated that once a State has demonstrated that it has an adequate RD&amp;T management process that meets
the requirements of this rule, the FHWA Division Office would consider a request for waiver of prior approval of programmatic
changes in the work program.

Section 420.205&blank;Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section explains the FHWA's intent to allow States maximum flexibility and discretion in managing and directing
their FHWA planning and research funded RD&amp;T activities while ensuring proper utilization of Federal funds
and avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for removal of paragraph (h), this section is unchanged from the NPRM. Paragraph (h) includes the nondiscrimination
provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and DOT and FHWA implementing regulations. Most of this paragraph
was redundant of &sect;420.121(m), which applies to RD&amp;T as well as planning programs. The citation to 23 CFR
part 200 that was in this paragraph has been moved to &sect;420.121(m).

Section 420.207&blank;Conditions for Grant Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section outlines the conditions that a State must meet for approval of FHWA planning and research funds for its
RD&amp;T activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) has been revised to indicate that a State's work program ``may'' include a line item for the costs associated
with a peer review of its RD&amp;T program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FHWA will establish criteria and develop and maintain a list of qualified individuals who will be available to
serve on peer review teams. A requirement has been added to paragraph (b) providing that at least two members of the
peer review team must be selected from the FHWA list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last sentence in paragraph (c) has been rewritten to eliminate the impression that the peer review team is under
the direction of the FHWA.

Section 420.209&blank; RD&amp;T Work Program

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section outlines the items that must be included in a State's work program and incorporates by reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;420.115 for approval and authorization procedures. The title of this section has been changed from ``State
work program'' to ``RD&amp;T work program'' since it includes provisions applicable to the RD&amp;T program. A requirement
to include a summary, listing the major items and estimated cost, has been added to this section. The summary will provide
a quick overview of the content of a State's RD&amp;T program.

Section 420.211&blank;Eligibility of Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section indicates eligible costs for FHWA participation in RD&amp;T activities and references &sect;420.113
for other eligible costs. Paragraph (c) was revised to conform with &sect;420.113(b).

Section 420.213&blank;Certification Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section provides the format for a State's certification indicating (1) State compliance with the requirements
of this subpart; (2) the condition under which a new certification is required; and (3) the due date for the initial
certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters noted that some States may not be able to comply with the proposed January 1, 1995, certification
date. The date for certification has been changed to June 30, 1995. In addition, a provision has been added that allows
the FHWA Division Administrator to grant conditional approval of a State's RD&amp;T management process for a State
unable to achieve full compliance by June 30, 1995. A conditional approval would cite those areas of the State's management
process that are deficient and that all deficiencies would need to be corrected by January 1, 1996.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions were asked on how often a certification needs to be submitted and if a State could begin operating under the
new procedures prior to proposed date of January 1, 1995. The certification is a one-time submittal, unless a State
significantly changes its RD&amp;T management process. A copy of the State's certification is to be submitted with
its work program. A State may begin operating under these procedures as soon as its RD&amp;T management process is
approved by the FHWA.

Section 420.215&blank;Procedure for Withdrawal of Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section outlines the procedures used and penalties imposed if a State is not complying with the requirements
of this subpart or is not performing in accordance with its RD&amp;T management process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) in the NPRM proposed that, for any State not in compliance, the FHWA would withdraw the State's ability
to approve RD&amp;T activities and require the State to submit individual studies for FHWA approval. This approval
requirement is similar to current procedures and would have provided little incentive for a State to correct deficiencies
in its program. Therefore, paragraph (d) has been revised to indicate that an adverse decision shall result in the
immediate withdrawal of FHWA planning and research funding for the State's RD&amp;T activities until the State is
in full compliance.

Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA has determined that this rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive
Order 12866 or a significant regulation under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation.
This action amends requirements for administration of FHWA planning and research funds to be consistent with legislative
changes made by the ISTEA. Also, this rulemaking establishes a mandatory State certification process and a Federal
and peer review process to determine annually whether each State complies with the standards for State RD&amp;T management
in subpart B. The economic costs of this rulemaking will be insignificant and will consist only of the costs associated
with preparation of the grant applications and State development of procedures for RD&amp;T management. The cost
savings that will be realized by the States due to the reduction in time to initiate and conduct RD&amp;T activities
under the State RD&amp;T management provisions will more than offset the one-time cost of development of the procedures.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this rule on small entities. This rule addresses the
administrative procedures and requirements that States must comply with when using FHWA planning and research funds
provided under title 23, U.S.C. This rule does not impose any direct requirement on small entities that would result
in increased economic costs. Based on this evaluation, the FHWA certifies that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.
Although this rule relates to requirements that States must meet to be eligible for FHWA planning and research funds,
federalism implications, though unavoidable, would be minimized. Nothing in this rule preempts any State law or
regulation. The rule provides States increased authority and flexibility to manage their federally assisted State
planning and research programs. This increase in authority and flexibility is in concert with the principles and
criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 for the implementation of express statutory provisions. Accordingly,
the FHWA certifies that this rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of
a full Federalism Assessment under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.

(a) Within the limitations of available funding and with the understanding that planning activities of national
significance, identified in paragraph (b) of this section, and the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134, 135, 303, and 307(c)
are being adequately addressed, the FHWA will allow STAs and their subrecipients: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Maximum possible flexibility in the use of FHWA planning and research funds to meet highway and multimodal transportation
planning and RD&amp;T needs at the national, State, and local levels while ensuring legal use of such funds and avoiding
unnecessary duplication of efforts; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To determine which eligible planning and RD&amp;T activities they desire to support with FHWA planning and research
funds and at what funding level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The STAs shall provide data that support the FHWA's responsibilities to the Congress and to the public. These data
include, but are not limited to, information required for: Preparing proposed legislation and reports to the Congress;
evaluating the extent, performance, condition, and use of the Nation's transportation systems; analyzing existing
and proposed Federal-aid funding methods and levels and the assignment of user cost responsibility; maintaining
a critical information base on fuel availability, use, and revenues generated; and calculating apportionment factors.

(a) In accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 307(c), not less than 25 percent of the SPR funds apportioned to a
State for a fiscal year shall be expended for RD&amp;T activities relating to highway, public transportation, and
intermodal transportation systems, unless the State certifies, and the FHWA accepts the State's certification,
that total expenditures by the State during the fiscal year for transportation planning under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 135
will exceed 75 percent of the amount apportioned for the fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Prior to submitting a request for an exception to the 25 percent requirement, the State shall ensure that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The additional planning activities are essential and there are no other reasonable options available for funding
these planning activities (including the use of National Highway System, Surface Transportation Program, or Federal
Transit Administration Section 26(a)(2) funds or by deferment of lower priority planning activities); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The planning activities have a higher priority than RD&amp;T activities in overall needs of the State for a given
year; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The total level of effort by the State in RD&amp;T (using both Federal and State funds) is adequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the State chooses to pursue an exception, the request, along with supporting justification, shall be sent to
the FHWA Division Administrator for action by the FHWA Associate Administrator for Research and Development. The
Associate Administrator's decision shall be based upon the following considerations:

Distribution of PL funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) States shall make all PL funds authorized by 23 U.S.C. 104(f) available to the MPOs in accordance with a formula
developed by the State, in consultation with the MPOs, and approved by the FHWA. The State shall not use any PL funds
for grant or subgrant administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In developing the formula for distributing PL funds, the State shall consider population, status of planning,
attainment of air quality standards, metropolitan area transportation needs, and other factors necessary to provide
for an appropriate distribution of funds to carry out the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134 and other applicable requirements
of Federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) As soon as practicable after PL funds have been apportioned by the FHWA to the States, the STAs shall inform the MPOs
and the FHWA of the amounts allocated to each MPO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) If the STA, in a State receiving the minimum apportionment of PL funds under the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 104(f)(2),
determines that the share of funds to be allocated to any MPO results in the MPO receiving more funds than necessary
to carry out the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 134(a), the STA may, after considering the views of the affected MPOs and with
the approval of the FHWA, use these funds to finance transportation planning outside of metropolitan planning areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) In accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 134(n), any PL funds not needed for carrying out the metropolitan
planning provisions of 23 U.S.C. 134 may be made available by the MPOs to the State for funding statewide planning activities
under 23 U.S.C. 135, subject to approval by the FHWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Any State PL fund distribution formula that does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section
shall be brought into conformance with such requirements as soon as possible, but no later than in time for distribution
of PL funds apportioned to the State for the first Federal fiscal year beginning after August 22, 1994.

acceptable to the FHWA. Statewide, metropolitan, other transportation planning activities, and transportation
RD&amp;T activities may be administered as separate programs, paired in various combinations, or brought together
as a single work program. Similarly, these transportation planning and RD&amp;T activities may be authorized for
fiscal purposes as one combined Federal-aid project or as separate Federal-aid projects. The expenditure of PL funds
for transportation planning outside of metropolitan planning areas under &sect;420.109(d) may be included in the
work program for statewide transportation planning activities or in a separate work program submitted by the STA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Work program(s) that document transportation planning activities shall include a description of work to be accomplished
and cost estimates for each activity. Additional information on metropolitan planning area work programs is contained
in 23 CFR 450.314. Additional information on research, development, and technology transfer work program content

Eligibility of costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Costs will be eligible for FHWA participation provided that the costs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Are for work performed for activities eligible under the section of title 23, U.S.C., applicable to the class of
funds used for the activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Are verifiable from the STA's or the subrecipient's records; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project objectives and meet the other
criteria for allowable costs in the applicable cost principles cited in 49 CFR 18.22; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Are included in the approved budget, or amendment thereto; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Were not incurred prior to FHWA authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, indirect costs of an STA are not eligible for reimbursement
with FHWA planning and research funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Salaries for services rendered by STA employees who are generally classified as administrative are eligible
for reimbursement for a transportation planning unit, RD&amp;T unit, or other unit performing eligible work with
FHWA planning and research funds (including development, establishment, and implementation of the management
and monitoring systems required by 23 U.S.C. 303 and 23 CFR part 500) in the ratio of time spent on the participating
portion of work in the unit to the total unit's working hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Indirect costs of MPOs and local governments are allowable if supported by a cost allocation plan and indirect
cost proposal approved in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;87. An initial plan and proposal
must be submitted to the Federal cognizant or oversight agency for negotiation and approval prior to recovering any
indirect costs. The cost allocation plan and indirect cost proposal shall be updated annually and retained by the
MPO or local government, unless requested to be resubmitted by the Federal cognizant or oversight agency, for review
at the time of the audit required in accordance with 49 CFR Part 90. If the MPO or local government's indirect cost rate
varies significantly from the rate approved for the previous year, or if the MPO or local government changes its accounting
system and affects the previously approved indirect cost allocation plan and proposal or rate and its basis of application,
the indirect cost allocation plan and proposal shall be resubmitted for negotiation and approval. In either case,
a rate shall be negotiated and approved for billing purposes until a new plan and proposal are approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Indirect costs of other STA subrecipients, including other State agencies, are allowable if supported by a cost
allocation plan and indirect cost proposal prepared, submitted, and approved by the cognizant or oversight agency
in accordance with the OMB requirements applicable to the subrecipient.

Approval and authorization procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The STA and its subrecipients shall obtain work program approval and authorization to proceed prior to beginning
work on activities in the work program. Such approvals and authorizations should be based on final work program documents.
The STA and its subrecipients also shall obtain prior approval for budget and programmatic changes as specified in
49 CFR 18.30 and for those items of allowable costs which require prior approval in accordance with the applicable
cost principles specified in 49 CFR 18.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Except for advance construction, authorization to proceed with the work program(s) in whole or in part shall be
deemed a contractual obligation of the Federal Government pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 106 and shall require that appropriate
funds be available for the full Federal share of the cost of work authorized. Those STAs that do not have sufficient
FHWA planning and research funds or obligation authority available to obligate the full Federal share of the entire
work program(s) may utilize the advance construction provisions of 23 U.S.C. 115(a) in accordance with the requirements
of 23 CFR Part 630, subpart G. The STAs that do not meet the advance construction provisions, or do not wish to utilize
them, may request authorization to proceed with that portion of the work program(s) for which FHWA planning and research
funds are available. In the latter case, authorization to proceed may be given for either selected work activities
or for a portion of the program period, but such authorization shall not constitute a commitment by the FHWA to fund
the remaining portion of the work program(s) should additional funds become available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A project agreement shall be executed by the STA and FHWA Division Office for each statewide transportation planning,
metropolitan planning area transportation planning, or RD&amp;T work program, individual activity or study, or
any combination administered as a single Federal-aid project. The project agreement shall be executed after the
authorization has been given by the FHWA to proceed with the work in whole or in part. In the event that the project agreement
is executed for only part of the work program, the project agreement shall be amended when authorization is given to
proceed with additional work.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Additional information on reporting requirements for individual RD&amp;T studies is contained in subpart B
of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The frequency of reports required by paragraph (b) of this section shall be annual unless more frequent reporting
is determined to be necessary by the FHWA; but in no case will reports be required more frequently than quarterly. These
reports are due 90 days after the end of the reporting period for annual and final reports and no later than 30 days after
the end of the reporting period for other reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Events that have significant impact on the work program(s) shall be reported as soon as they become known. The type
of events or conditions that require reporting include: problems, delays, or adverse conditions that will materially
affect the ability to attain program objectives. This disclosure shall be accompanied by a statement of the action
taken, or contemplated, and any Federal assistance needed to resolve the situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) A provision of the Federal-Aid Project Agreement requires both the preparation of suitable reports to document
the results of activities performed with FHWA planning and research funds and FHWA approval prior to publishing such
reports. The STA may request a waiver of the requirement for prior approval. The FHWA's approval constitutes acceptance
of such reports as evidence of work performed but does not imply endorsement of a report's findings or recommendations.
Reports prepared for FHWA funded work shall include appropriate credit references and disclaimer statements.

Fifth Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission adopts rules governing competitive bidding to award initial licenses in the Personal Communications
Services in the 2 GHz band (broadband PCS''). This action is taken to implement Section 309(j) of the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended. The new rules will promote the development and rapid deployment of new technologies, products,
and services for the benefit of the public, including those residing in rural areas. These rules also will promote
economic opportunity and competition, and disseminate licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small
businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women. This action
will result in recovery for the public of a portion of the value of the public spectrum made available for commercial
use.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we adopt rules to conduct auctions for the award of more than 2,000 licenses to provide personal communications services
in the 2 GHz band, which we call ``broadband PCS.'' These broadband PCS auctions will constitute the largest auction
of public assets in American history and are expected to recover billions of dollars for the United States Treasury.
More importantly, the auctions will lead to the introduction of an array of new telecommunications products and services
that are expected to fuel our nation's economic growth and revolutionize the way in which Americans communicate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We also adopt in this Order provisions to fulfill Congress's mandate that we ensure that small businesses, rural
telephone companies and businesses owned by minorities and women are given the opportunity to participate in the
provision of broadband PCS. These rules will provide unprecedented opportunities for these designated entities
to become meaningfully involved in the provision of a new telecommunications service. This action seeks to ensure
that licenses for broadband PCS are disseminated to a wide variety of applicants and to remedy the serious underrepresentation
of minorities and women in the provision of telecommunications services. Further, by the actions we take today we
seek to ensure that PCS is provided to all communities in this country, including rural areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Broadband PCS will provide a variety of mobile services that will compete with existing cellular services. In addition,
broadband PCS is expected to provide new mobile communications capabilities that are not currently available. These
services will be provided by means of a new generation of communications devices that will include small, lightweight,
multi-function portable phones, portable facsimile and other imaging devices, new types of multi-channel cordless
phones, and advanced paging devices with two-way data capabilities.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The introduction of broadband PCS should benefit consumers by raising the overall level of competition in many already
competitive segments of the telecommunications industry and by providing competition in other segments for the
first time. The broadband PCS industry should also generate thousands of jobs in this country and improve the international
competitiveness of the American economy.

We already have adopted rules for competitive bidding on licenses to be awarded to provide personal communications
services in the 900 MHz band (narrowband PCS), which will be used primarily to provide advanced paging services, and
for licenses to provide Interactive Video and Data Service (IVDS), which will be used to provide services such as home
shopping and pay-per-view programming.

4. Auctions for broadband PCS licenses will be conducted pursuant to Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, 47
U.S.C. &sect;309(j), which was enacted in August 1993. Section 309(j) granted the Commission express authority
to employ competitive bidding procedures to award licenses to use the electromagnetic spectrum.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Section 309(j)(1) permits auctions only where mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses are accepted
for filing by the Commission and where the principal use of the spectrum is reasonably likely to involve the receipt
by the licensee of compensation from subscribers in return for enabling those subscribers to receive or transmit
communications signals. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in his proceeding, we concluded that PCS as a class of service satisfies the Section 309(j)(1) criteria. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), at &para;&para;54&hyph;58. Accordingly, if mutually exclusive applications for a broadband PCS license are
accepted for filing, we will award that license through competitive bidding.

We adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making to implement Section 309(j) on September 23, 1993. Notice of Proposed Rule
Making in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, 8 FCC Rcd 7635, 58 FR 53489, Oct. 15, 1993 (hereinafter ``NPRM'' or ``Notice'').
The Commission received 222 comments, 169 reply comments and numerous

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that we could design auction procedures to govern the award of broadband PCS licenses that would promote the objectives
listed in Section 309(j)(3). More specifically, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we determined that the use of competitive bidding to award broadband PCS licenses, as compared with other licensing
methods, would speed the development and deployment of new services to the public and would encourage efficient use
of the spectrum, as required by Section 309(j)(3) (A) and (D). In this regard, we noted that auctions would generally
award licenses quickly to those parties who value them most highly and who are therefore most likely to introduce service
rapidly to the public. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. at &para;57. We also concluded that competitive bidding would recover for the public a portion of the value of the
spectrum, as envisioned in Section 309(j)(3)(C). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We considered a variety of methods to implement Congress's remaining objectives, set forth in Section 309(j)(3)(B),
of ``promoting economic opportunity'' and ``avoiding excessive concentration of licenses'' by disseminating
licenses ``among a wide variety of applicants.'' In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we adopted rules which provide the Commission with a menu of options to choose from to promote these objectives with
respect to particular spectrum services to be auctioned, such as broadband PCS, in service-specific rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In our 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we established bandwidth assignments and area designations for broadband PCS. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314, FCC 93&hyph;451, 8 FCC Rcd 7700, 58 FR 59174, Nov. 8, 1993. In that Order, we allocated
120 MHz of spectrum for licensed broadband PCS. We divided the licensed broadband PCS spectrum into three 30 MHz blocks
(blocks A, B and C) and three 10 MHz blocks (blocks D, E and F). We also designated two different service areas: 493 Basic
Trading Areas (``BTAs'') and 51 Major Trading Areas (``MTAs'').
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The licenses in frequency blocks A and B will be awarded on an MTA basis, and the licenses on frequency blocks C, D, E and
F will be awarded on a BTA basis. A total of 2,074 broadband PCS licenses will therefore be issued.

See Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;&para;102&hyph;132, 147&hyph;158. By these rules, we intend to promote competition in the wireless telecommunications
market by as many different qualified providers as the spectrum can reasonably accommodate and to promote the rapid
deployment of the infrastructure required to provide broadband PCS.

II. Executive Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. In this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we set forth the specific auction procedures for broadband PCS licenses. We have decided to conduct three auctions:
the first for the 99 available PCS licenses in MTA blocks A and B, the second for the 986 PCS licenses in BTA blocks C and
F, and the third for the remaining 986 PCS licenses in BTA blocks D and E. That is, the first auction will award licenses
for the 30 MHz blocks for large geographic areas. The second auction will award licenses for smaller geographic areas
for the two blocks that, as explained below, we have reserved for bidding by relatively small companies. In these ``entrepreneurs'
blocks,'' we have designed procedures to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies and businesses
owned by women and minorities, which we collectively refer to as designated entities, have ``the opportunity to participate
in the provision'' of PCS, as Congress directed in Section 309(j)(4)(D). In the third auction we will award licenses
for the remaining 10 MHz blocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. We intend to conduct each auction through simultaneous multiple round bidding with simultaneous stopping rules.
Under that approach, no license awarded until the bidding closes on all licenses in the auction. We have determined
that simultaneous multiple round bidding is appropriate where the value of the licenses is high compared to the cost
of conducting the auction and the values of licenses are interdependent. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;106&hyph;111. We believe the former condition is met here because other government agencies project that
the boardband PMS licenses will be auctioned for as much as $10.6 billion. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;177. The latter condition is also satisfied because the record demonstrates, for example, that a license
for the Philadelphia MTA or the Richmond MTA will likely be valued more highly if it is held in conjunction with the license
for the Washington-Baltimore MTA. We are adopting a variety of rules governing bid increments and bidding activity
to move the auctions toward completion in a reasonable period of time. We are also retaining the ability to use other
approaches, including sequential auctions for the licenses, and to make other adjustments to the auction process
as necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. As mentioned above, we establish by this Order a number of rules to implement Congress's mandate in Section 309(j)(4)(D)
that we ensure that designated entities are ``given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based
services'' such as broadband PCS. To accomplish this objective, Congress directed us to ``consider the use of tax
certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures.'' 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(4)(D). We construe this congressional
directive as a mandate that we take the steps that are necessary to ensure that designated entities have a realistic
opportunity to obtain broadband PCS licenses. We apply that mandate in light of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 497 U.S. 547, 564&hyph;565 (1990), which held that ``benign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress *&blank;*&blank;*
are constitutionally permissible to the extent that they serve important governmental objectives within the power
of Congress and are substantially related to achievement of those objectives.'' The rules we adopt also further Congress's
objectives, set forth in Section 309(j)(3)(B), of ``promoting economic opportunity and competition and ensuring
that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration
of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small business, rural telephone
companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.'' Each of the steps adopted here is directly
related to carrying out Congress's stated objective of promoting economic opportunity by disseminating broadband
PCS licenses to a wide variety of applicants, including designated entities.

10. The record clearly demonstrates that the primary impediment to participation by designated entities is lack
of access to capital. This impediment arises for small businesses from the higher costs they face in raising capital
and for businesses owned by minorities and women from lending discrimination as well. In this regard, it should be
noted that although auctions have many beneficial aspects, they threaten to erect another barrier to participation
by small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women by raising the cost of entry into spectrum-based
services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Congress has recognized that ``small business concerns, which represent higher degrees of risk in financial
markets than do large businesses, are experiencing increased difficulties in obtaining credit.''
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Congress further found that women and minorities face particularly severe problems in raising capital.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 A study of mortgage lending conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in 1992 illustrates how problems arise.
That study showed that in cases in which lenders exercised discretion in deciding whether to make a loan to a borrower
who presented some problems (which includes most mortgage applicants), that discretion tended to be exercised in
favor of whites. As a result, a minority applicant for a mortgage who was identical in all pertinent respects to a white
applicant nevertheless was 60 percent more likely to be denied a mortgage loan.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 At the same time, discrimination was difficult to show in any particular case, although it emerged clearly when data
concerning hundreds of mortgage applications were reviewed.

12. The first measure we adopt to fulfill Congress's mandate that we ensure that designated entities have the opportunity
to participate in providing broadband PCS is to reserve the 30 MHz licenses on block C and the 10 MHz licenses on block
F, both of which are to be licensed in each of the 493 BTAs, for bidding by entities with annual gross revenues of less
than $125 million and total assets of less than $500 million. These limits will exclude many large telecommunications
companies from bidding on these two blocks. We will not allow one entity to obtain more than 10 percent (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 98) of the licenses on these two blocks. By excluding large companies from bidding in these two blocks and by limiting
the total number of licenses that one entity can obtain in these blocks we create numerous opportunities for small
entities to become PCS providers and thereby ensure that broadband PMS licenses will be disseminated ``among a wide
variety of applicants,'' as required by Section 309(j)(3)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Reserving blocks C and F for bidding by relatively small companies will not, by itself, be sufficient to ensure
that small businesses and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women have the opportunity to obtain
broadband PCS licenses. Under the definition we apply or purposes of this Order, ``small businesses'' are those with
gross revenues not exceeding $40 million, and those businesses will be at a disadvantage in competing against companies
with gross revenues of as much as $125 million. In addition, businesses owned by members of minority groups and women
face discrimination that poses additional obstacles for these firms. Accordingly, we take five related steps within
the entrepreneurs' blocks to assist designated entities in attracting the capital necessary to obtain a broadband
PCS license.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. First, we will structure our attribution rules to allow those extremely large companies that may not bid on blocks
C and F to invest in entities that bid on those blocks. More specifically, we will allow the relatively small companies
eligible to bid in these blocks to obtain investment representing up to 75 percent of their passive equity from larger
companies so long as each investor holds no more than a 25 percent passive equity interest. In addition, eligible businesses
owned by minorities and women may choose to have a single investor, no matter how large, hold a passive equity interest
up to 49.9 percent. These rules, and others that we establish in this Order, are designed to enhance access to capital
by businesses owned by minorities and women.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Second, to encourage large companies to invest in designated entities and to assist designated entities without
large investors to overcome the additional hurdle presented by auctions, we will make bidding credits available
to designated entities. More specifically, small businesses will receive a 10 percent bidding credit (or a 10 percent
discount on their winning bids). Businesses owned by minorities and women will receive a 15 percent bidding credit
to compensate for the substantial problems they face in attracting capital. The credits will be cumulative, so that
a business owned by minorities or women that also qualifies as a small business will receive a 25 percent bidding credit.
Under these rules, it still will be more expensive for designated entities to participate in the provision of spectrum-based
services than it was before Congress granted us authority to hold auctions, because they will have to purchase licenses.
But by adopting bidding credits, which are explicitly authorized by Section 309(j)(4)(D), the Commission seeks
to promote economic opportunity and to counterbalance the tendency of auctions to concentrate license ownership
in the hands of several very large companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Third, we will allow most successful bidders within the entrepreneurs' blocks to pay for their licenses in installments
for generally the same reasons_encouraging large companies to invest in designated entities, promoting economic
opportunity by assisting designated entities in overcoming the additional hurdle presented by auctions, and ensuring
that licenses are disseminated widely. In general, successful bidders will be permitted to defer payments of principal
on their debt to the government for some period. Small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women will
be permitted to defer payments of principal for a longer period than other successful bidders in these blocks. Finally,
businesses owned by minorities and women will be charged a lower interest rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Fourth, we will extend our tax certificate policies to promote participation by minorities and women in the provision
of broadband PCS. The holder of a tax certificate is permitted to defer payment of the capital gains tax that would otherwise
be recognized upon the sale of an investment. Our extension of the tax certificate policy to broadband PCS will promote
involvement by minorities and women in spectrum-based services in three ways. First, initial investors in such businesses
will be eligible for tax certificates upon the sale of their investments. We expect that the availability of such favorable
tax treatment will enable minority- and women-owned businesses to attract investors more easily. Second, holders
of broadband PCS licenses will be able to obtain tax certificates upon the sale of the business to a company controlled
by minorities and women. Third, a cellular operator that sells its interest in an overlapping cellular system to a
minority- or woman-owned business to come into compliance with our PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule will be eligible
for a tax certificate. Both the second and third policy will further Congress' objective of ensuring that spectrum
licenses are disseminated widely and, in particular, to designated entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. Finally, we will reduce the upfront payment for all bidders in the entrepreneurs' block. Bidders in the other blocks
will pay $0.02 per MHz per pop while winners in the entrepreneurs' blocks will receive a 25 percent discount and pay
only $0.015 per MHz per pop as a pre-auction payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. Congress was also concerned that rural areas not go unserved by PCS, and therefore directed us to ensure participation
in auctions for spectrum-based services by rural telephone companies who have a history of service to rural areas
and an established infrastructure on which to build a PCS business effectively. Thus, we establish partitioning
rules in this Order that will allow them to use their existing wireline network to efficiently and expeditiously provide
PCS in rural areas. In addition, most rural telephone companies will qualify to bid on the entrepreneurs' blocks,
and hence will be eligible for installment payments. Those rural telephone companies that qualify as small or minority-
or women-owned businesses will also be able to take advantage of the applicable bidding credits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. The rules that we adopt today are designed to ensure that only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
designated entities qualify for the special provisions established to ensure their participation in broadband
PCS. The rules are designed to enable designated entities to attract passive equity from non-designated entities,
provided that designated entities maintain control and a substantial entity stake in the ventures at all times. The
Commission will not tolerate ``fronts'' that are controlled by supposedly passive investors, and we will be vigilant
in preventing abuse of the designated entity provisions. Our rules are also designed to prevent designated entities
from assigning licenses obtained through the use of these special measures or who otherwise lose their designated
entity status before the end of a required five-year holding period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
22. Section 309(j)(1) of the Communications Act, as amended, 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(1), permits auctions only where
mutually exclusive applications for initial licenses or construction permits are accepted for filing by the Commission
and where the principal use of the spectrum will involve or is reasonably likely to involve the receipt by the licensee
of compensation from subscribers in return for enabling those subscribers to receive or transmit communications
signals. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we concluded that PCS as a class of service would satisfy the section 309(j)(1) criteria for auctionability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;&para;54&hyph;58. Specifically, based on the record in this proceeding and in GEN Docket No. 90&hyph;314,
we concluded that the principal use of broadband PCS spectrum satisfied these auction criteria.

award that license through competitive bidding.

In the Second Report and Order, we addressed the only commenter who argued that the Commission should not find that
the principal use of PCS is likely to be for the provision of service to subscribers for compensation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Second Report and Order at &para;&para; 55&hyph;56. The Commission rejected the argument of Millin Publications,
a publisher of specialized information services that intends to utilize PCS frequencies on a non-subscription basis,
that the Commission should refrain from making the principal use finding because PCS does not yet exist. We concluded
that the overwhelming weight of the comments in this proceeding, as well as our experience with the PCS experiments
that we have licensed, reflect that licensed PCS spectrum is likely to be used principally for the provision of service
to subscribers for compensation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
23. As noted above, we concluded in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the criteria in Section 309(j)(3) will be satisfied by competitive bidding for broadband PCS licenses, and thus
that broadband PCS should be subject to our competitive bidding procedures. We determined that the use of competitive
bidding to award broadband PCS licenses, as compared with other licensing methods, will speed the development and
deployment of new services to the public with minimal administrative or judicial delay, and will encourage efficient
use of the spectrum as required by Section 309(j)(3) (A) and (D). We also concluded that competitive bidding would
recover for the public a portion of the value of the spectrum, as envisioned in Section 309(j)(3)(C). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Finally, in accordance with Section 309(j)(3)(B), we adopted a set of open competitive bidding procedures and a menu
of special provisions designed to increase opportunities for designated entities who might otherwise face entry
barriers. Our views on this matter remain unchanged since adoption of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We therefore affirm in this Order the use of competitive bidding procedures to award broadband PCS licenses.

24. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 established the criteria to be used in selecting which auction design method to use for each particular auctionable
service. Generally, we concluded that awarding licenses to those parties who value them most highly will foster Congress'
policy objectives. In this regard, we noted that since a bidder's ability to introduce valuable new services and to
deploy them quickly, intensively, and efficiently increases the value of a license to that bidder, an auction design
that awards licenses to those bidders with the highest willingness to pay tends to promote the development and rapid
deployment of new services and the efficient and intensive use of the spectrum. In articulating our auction design
principles we further stated that: (1) Licenses with strong value interdependencies should be auctioned simultaneously;
(2) multiple round auctions, by providing bidders with information regarding other bidders' valuations of licenses,
generally will yield more efficient allocations of licenses and higher revenues, especially where there is substantial
uncertainty as to value; and (3) because they are relatively expensive to implement and time-consuming, simultaneous
and/or multiple round auctions become less cost-effective as the value of licenses decreases. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;69.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. Based on the foregoing, we concluded that where the licenses to be auctioned are interdependent and their value
is expected to be high, simultaneous multiple round auctions would best achieve the Commission's goals for competitive
bidding. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;&para; 109&hyph;111. We indicated that compared with other bidding mechanisms, simultaneous multiple
round bidding will generate the most information about license values during the course of the auction and provide
bidders with the most flexibility to pursue back-up strategies. Thus, we concluded that simultaneous multiple round
bidding is most likely to award interdependent licenses to the bidders who value them the most. We also indicated that
this method will facilitate efficient aggregation of licenses across spectrum bands, thereby resulting in vigorous
competition among several strong service providers who will be able rapidly to introduce a wide variety of services
highly valued by end users. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para; 106. In addition, we concluded that because of the superior information and flexibility it provides, this
method is likely to yield greater revenues than other auction designs. Thus, we found that the use of simultaneous
multiple round auctions would generally be preferred. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. However, because simultaneous multiple round bidding is likely to be more administratively complex and costly
both for bidders and for the FCC than sequential or single round bidding, we indicated that we would use this auction
design only where license values are interdependent and the expected value of the licenses to be auctioned is high
relative to the costs of conducting a simultaneous multiple round auction. See Second Report and Order

27. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we considered several auction methods including simultaneous multiple round bidding, sequential bidding, and
combinatorial bidding. We discuss each of these below. We have chosen to adopt simultaneous multiple round auctions
as our auction methodology for broadband PCS licenses. We believe that for broadband licenses this method will best
meet Congress' goals in authorizing competitive bidding in section 309(j) of the Communications Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
28. There is considerable support in the record for the use of simultaneous multiple round auctions, in which two or
more licenses are put up for bid at the same time, and there are multiple bidding rounds in which bidders have the opportunity
to top the high bids from the previous round. Several comments and studies in the record by academic auction experts
advocate simultaneous multiple round bidding for broadband PCS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 also supports simultaneous multiple round bidding for broadband PCS auctions. We concluded that multiple round
bidding is generally superior to single round bidding, and that when licenses are interdependent, simultaneous
bidding is generally superior to sequential bidding. As we noted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, multiple-round auctions have the advantage over single-round auctions insofar as they provide more information
to bidders about the value that other bidders place on licenses, increasing the likelihood that the licenses are acquired
by those who value them most highly and increasing the revenue likely to be gained from the auction. Multiple-round
auctions are also more likely to be perceived as open and fair. The disadvantage of multiple round auctions is that
they have higher administrative costs than single round auctions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, simultaneous auctions are more likely than sequential auctions to award interdependent licenses efficiently
because they provide more information about the value of interdependent licenses and allow the use of that information
because all licenses remain available throughout the bidding process. Simultaneous auctions are also likely to
raise more revenue than sequential auctions for two reasons. First, they increase the value of the licenses by facilitating
efficient aggregation. Second, because they provide more information about the value of interdependent licenses
they reduce the propensity of sophisticated bidders to bid cautiously in order to avoid the ``winner's curse''_the
tendency for the winner to be the bidder who most overestimates the value of the item up for bid. Simultaneous auctions
also eliminate the need to choose the order in which licenses will be auctioned. The advantage offered by simultaneous
auctions depends on how much interdependence exists among licenses.

31. We agree with commenters who support simultaneous multiple round bidding for awarding broadband PCS licenses.
Estimates of total PCS revenues by the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office indicate
that the value of broadband PCS licenses will likely be sufficiently high to warrant the use of simultaneous auctions.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 We further believe that the values of most broadband PCS licenses will be significantly interdependent because of
the desirability of aggregation across spectrum blocks and geographic regions and because there is a high degree
of substitutability among licenses with the same amount of spectrum and covering the same geographic area. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at &para;&para;90&hyph;91. Compared with other bidding mechanisms, simultaneous multiple round bidding generates
the most information about license values during the course of the auction and provides bidders with the most flexibility
to pursue back-up strategies, and is therefore most likely to award licenses to the bidders who value them the most.
Simultaneous multiple round auctions will also facilitate efficient aggregation across spectrum bands, where
permitted, thereby enhancing competition among wireless products and services.

32. We recognize, however, that simultaneous multiple round bidding may involve a greater degree of complexity than
other competitive bidding methods, and that it may present greater operational difficulties both for the FCC and
for bidders, especially where many bidders are expected to participate. Therefore, we will use a sequence of simultaneous
auctions. Licenses that are highly interdependent will be grouped together and auctioned simultaneously.

2. Sequential Auctions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
33. In a pure sequential auction, whether oral or electronic, licenses are put up for bid one at a time, so that bidding
ends on one item before it begins on the next item. Sequential multiple round oral or electronic auctions generate
valuable information about earlier auctioned licenses, which can assist bidders in valuing later auctioned licenses.
If license values are interdependent, however, sequential oral or electronic auctions are less likely than simultaneous
auctions to award interdependent licenses to the parties who value them most highly and to result in the efficient
aggregation of licenses, because bidders for licenses that are auctioned early must bid with less information about
the value of licenses to be auctioned later, and they will have less opportunity to pursue backup bidding strategies.
For these reasons, we conclude that sequential multiple round auctions are less preferred in the award of broadband
PCS licenses than simultaneous multiple round auctions. Nevertheless, if, as a result of our auction experience,
we determine that the operational costs or complexities associated with simultaneous multiple round auctions outweigh
their benefits, we may decide instead to employ pure sequential oral or electronic (multiple round) auctions or a
sequence of single combined oral auctions in which bidding is combined for all licenses in a given band with the same
bandwidth and the same geographic service area. If such a change becomes necessary, the auction method will be announced
by Public Notice before each auction.

34. If we should decide in the future to use sequential oral or sequential electronic bidding for relatively homogeneous
licenses, we will employ a single combined auction design. Under this approach, the Commission will combine bidding
for all licenses in the same band with the same amount of spectrum and same geographic service area.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Licenses will be awarded market by market to the highest bidders until all the available licenses are exhausted, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, two relatively homogeneous licenses would be awarded to the two highest bidders. Because broadband PCS licenses
may not be perfectly homogeneous (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, bidders may prefer one frequency over another within the same geographic region for purposes of efficient aggregation),
winning bidders will be given the opportunity to choose among licenses for which bidding is combined in descending
order of their bid amounts (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

3. Combinatorial Bidding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
35. In general terms, combinatorial bidding allows bidders to bid for multiple licenses as all-or-nothing packages.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Combinatorial bidding can be implemented with either simultaneous or sequential auction designs. Although we recognized
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that there may be significant benefits associated with combinatorial bidding, especially in terms of efficient
aggregation of licenses, we concluded that simultaneous multiple round auctions offer many of the same advantages
without the same degree of administrative and operational complexity and without biasing auction outcomes in favor
of combination bids. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;&para; 101&hyph;105. On balance, we believe that the advantages of combinatorial bidding appear unlikely
to outweigh the disadvantages. While broadband PCS licenses are likely to be worth more to some bidders as a part of
a package, we believe that simultaneous multiple round bidding will provide these bidders with ample opportunity
to express the value of interdependent licenses. Moreover, we conclude that there will not be any extreme discontinuity
in value if some licenses in a package are not obtained. We believe that the opportunity to acquire licenses in post-auction
transactions and the ability to withdraw bids (upon payment of the bid withdrawal penalty) will limit the risks associated
with failing to acquire all of the licenses in a desired package. Nevertheless, if, based on our experience with the
initial simultaneous multiple round auctions and auction experiments, we determine that such auctions do not result
in efficient aggregation of licenses, and if there are significant advances in the development of combinatorial
auctions, we may, by public notice prior to a specific auction, choose to use combinatorial bidding techniques in
conjunction with simultaneous multiple round auctions.

In combinatorial bidding, if a bid for a group of licenses exceeds the sum of the highest bids for the individual licenses
that comprise the package, then the package bid would win. In the Second Report and Order we also indicated that if we
were to utilize combinatorial bidding we might institute a premium so that the combinatorial bid would win only if
it exceeded the sum of the bids for individual licenses by a set amount.

1. Grouping of Licenses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
36. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission concluded that highly interdependent licenses should be grouped together and put up for bid at the
same time in a multiple round auction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;&para; 106&hyph;107. This will facilitate awarding licenses to the bidders who value them most highly because
it will provide bidders information about the prices of complementary and substitutable licenses while such licenses
are still up for bid. The magnitude of the benefit of auctioning a group of licenses together in a simultaneous multiple
round auction increases with the degree of interdependence among the licenses. On the other hand, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 also noted that the cost and complexity, both for the FCC and for bidders, of auctioning a very large number of interdependent
licenses simultaneously may outweigh the informational and bidding flexibility advantages. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para; 107. Accordingly, although we believe that all broadband PCS licenses are interdependent, we will not auction
them all simultaneously. Instead, we will divide the licenses into three groups by combining those licenses that
are most closely related so that there will be limited interdependence across groups. Then we will sequentially conduct
a separate simultaneous multiple round auction for each group. We formed the three groups in two conceptual steps.
First, we separated the ``entrepreneurs''' blocks (C and F) from all other blocks.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Then, we separated the large unrestricted blocks (A and B, with 30 MHz of spectrum and MTA geographic scope) from the
small ones (D and E, with 10 MHz of spectrum and BTA geographic scope).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained in more detail below, we establish economic eligibility criteria for bidders in blocks C and F.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
37. In the first auction, the 99 available MTA licenses in blocks A and B will be put up for bid. In the second auction,
the 986 BTA licenses in blocks C and F will be put up for bid. And in the last auction, the 986 BTA licenses in blocks D and
E will be put up for bid. As explained below, we believe that this grouping strikes a proper balance among the competing
concerns of awarding licenses to the parties who value them most highly, keeping the auction process simple and manageable,
minimizing administrative delay, and fostering designated entity participation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
38. Separating the entrepreneurs' blocks (C and F) from all other blocks entails little loss of efficiency because
most firms are likely to be interested in licenses in either the entrepreneurs' blocks or the non-restricted blocks,
but not both. Large firms cannot bid on entrepreneurs' licenses, although they may partner with firms that can. Small
firms can bid on all blocks, but are likely to be most interested in the entrepreneurs' blocks because on these blocks
they would not be placed in the position of bidding against large firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39. In addition to reducing the complexity of the auctions, auctioning block C licenses after the block A and B licenses
is likely to further another objective of auction design_fostering designated entity participation_by enabling
designated entities to more easily attract partners. Many potential partners may be unwilling to commit themselves
to a partnership arrangement with designated entities prior to the auction of licenses on the A and B blocks. So, designated
entities that are unable to raise independent financing for at least the required upfront and down payments may have
difficulty participating in an auction in which block C is put up for bid simultaneously with blocks A and B. If, however,
block C is auctioned after blocks A and B, we expect that non-designated entities who are unsuccessful in acquiring
MTA licenses on blocks A and B will want to become partners with or make investments in designated entities so as to gain
an interest in 30 MHz licenses on block C. In addition, the auction on blocks A and B will produce price information that
would be valuable to designated entities in their business planning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40. The efficiency loss associated with separating the large unrestricted blocks (A and B) from the small ones (D and
E) depends on the degree of substitutability and complementarity between licenses in these two groups. Auctioning
licenses on the D and E blocks separately from those on the A and B blocks may make it more difficult for bidders to pursue
a back-up strategy of combining two 10 MHz licenses in the same geographic areas as an alternative to acquiring 30 MHz
licenses in the A or B blocks. We believe, however, that this is not likely to be a widely used strategy, because the licenses
are defined on a BTA basis while the licenses on the A and B blocks are defined on a MTA basis. It is also possible that some
bidders may wish to combine a 10 MHz license with a 30 MHz license in the same geographic area. Although this approach
would be easier to pursue if blocks A, B, D and E were auctioned together, we believe that in most cases the amount bidders
would be willing to pay for a block A or B license would not be strongly affected by whether they were able to acquire a
complementary block D or E license. So auctioning blocks D and E after blocks A and B would not significantly hinder
combining 30 MHz and 10 MHz licenses. We conclude that the benefits of administrative simplicity from auctioning
license on blocks A and B separately from those on blocks D and E are likely to outweigh the possible loss of efficiency.

2. Bid Increments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
41. In using simultaneous multiple round auctions to award broadband PCS licenses, it is important to specify minimum
bid increments.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 The bid increment is the amount or percentage by which the bid must be raised above the previous round's high bid in order
to be accepted as a valid bid in the current bidding round. The application of a minimum bid increment speeds the progress
of the auction and, along with activity and stopping rules, helps to ensure that the auction comes to closure within
a reasonable period of time. Establishing an appropriate minimum bid increment is especially important in a simultaneous
auction with a simultaneous closing rule. In that case, all markets remain open until there is no bidding on any license,
and a delay in closing one market will delay the closing of all markets.

42. Because we plan to use simultaneous multiple round auctions to award broadband PCS licenses, we believe that it
is necessary to impose a minimum bid increment to ensure that the broadband PCS auctions conclude within a reasonable
period of time. Commenters addressing the issue generally supported a minimum bid increment of 5 percent. PacTel,
for example, argues that this amount will provide a reasonable compromise between the goal of completing the auction
quickly and that of revealing information about the distribution of valuations among bidders.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 As we recognized in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, it is important in establishing the amount of the minimum bid increment to express such increment as the greater of
a percentage and fixed dollar amount. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;126. This will ensure a timely completion of the auction even if bidding begins at a very low dollar amount.
Accordingly, we will impose a minimum bid increment of some percentage of the high bid from the previous round or a dollar
amount per MHz per pop, whichever is greater, in broadband PCS auctions where multiple round bidding is used.

``Pop'' refers to each member of the population of the license service area and ``MHz'' refers to the amount of spectrum,
in megahertz, that the licensee is permitted to use. For example, for a 30 MHz license with a population of 10 million,
if the minimum bid increment were the greater of 5 percent or $0.02 per MHz per pop, the minimum bid increment would be
$6 million ($0.02&times;30 MHz&times;10,000,000) when the high bid from the previous round is less than $120 million.
If the high bid from the previous round exceeds $120 million, the minimum bid would be 5 percent of the value of that bid
(since 5 percent of a bid over $120 million is greater than $6 million).

43. PacTel also suggests, in the context of simultaneous auctions, that the Commission should vary the bid increment,
reducing it as the number of active bidders declines.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, PacBell suggests that the bid increment depend on the stage of the auction, with a 5 percent increment in
stage I, 2 percent in stage II, and 1 percent in stage III.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 This would move the auction quickly at the beginning, when prices have limited informational content and there is
little benefit to either bidders or the Commission of refined price movements, while allowing bidders to express
small differences in valuations as the auction nears a close, increasing both efficiency and auction revenues. Small
bid increments also reduce the chances of ties. Where a tie does occur, the high bidder will be determined by the order
in which the bids were received by the Commission.

falls. The minimum bid increment in stage I of the auction will be 5 percent of the high bid in the previous round or $.02
per MHz per pop, whichever is greater.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 We will reduce the minimum bid increment as we move through the auction stages, with a minimum bid increment of the greater

45. In addition, the Commission will establish a suggested minimum bid on each license. Bids below the suggested minimum
bid will count as activity under the activity rule (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) only if no bids at or above the suggested minimum bid are received. Initial bids must be above the minimum bid increment
of $.02 per MHz per pop, but may be below the suggested minimum bid. Once a bid has been received on a license, the suggested
minimum bid is no longer applicable in subsequent rounds. The amount of the suggested minimum bid may vary by market
size, with a larger minimum bid in larger markets, and will be announced by public notice prior to each auction. We will
establish suggested minimum bids at no less than $.05 per MHz per pop and not more than $.20 per MHz per pop. The suggested
minimum bid provides bidders an incentive to start bidding at a substantial fraction of the final prices of licenses,
thus ensuring a rapid conclusion of the auction, while still allowing for bidding on licenses whose market values
are below the suggested minimum bids.

3. Stopping Rules for Multiple Round Auctions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
46. We also noted in the Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that with multiple round auctions a stopping rule must be established for determining when the auction is over.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 In simultaneous multiple round auctions, bidding may close separately on individual licenses, simultaneously
on all licenses, or a hybrid approach may be used. Under an individual, license-by-license approach, bidding closes
on each license after one round passes in which no new acceptable bids are submitted for that particular license. With
a simultaneous stopping rule, bidding remains open on all licenses until there is no new acceptable bid on any license.
This approach has the advantage of providing bidders full flexibility to bid for any license as more information becomes
available during the course of the auction, but it may lead to very long auctions, unless an activity rule (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is imposed. A hybrid approach combines the first two stopping rules. For example, we may use a simultaneous stopping
rule (along with an activity rule designed to expedite closure for licenses subject to the simultaneous stopping
rule) for the higher value licenses. For lower value licenses, where the loss from eliminating some back-up strategies
is less, we may use simpler license-by-license closings. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

efficiency or expected revenue.

 Second Report and Order at &para;127. Commenters agreed on the importance of the appropriate stopping rule. PacTel
proposes that bidding on an individual license close if there are no new bids on that license within a given round, or
if there are fewer than two bids greater than a ``suggested minimum bid.'' Comments of PacTel, Attachment of R. Preston
McAfee at 16&hyph;18. Pacific Bell recommends simultaneous closing of bidding on all licenses when there are no new
acceptable bids on any license. Comments of PacBell, Attachment of Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson at 19; reply comments
of PacBell, Attachment of Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson, Appendix at 5. Bell Atlantic Personal Communications,
on the other hand, asserts that in simultaneous auctions, no stopping rule can prevent strategic delays. They provide
no evidence for this, however, and do not discuss any closing rule in detail. In discussing the Milgrom-Wilson closing
rule they fail to account for the Milgrom-Wilson activity rule, which will reduce the likelihood of delay, and the
fail-safe closing mechanism proposed by Milgrom and Wilson. Reply comments of Bell Atlantic Personal Communications,

47. For broadband PCS we believe that a simultaneous stopping rule is preferable for all MTA licenses. MTA licenses
are expected to have relatively high values and are fewer in number than BTA licenses, which will reduce the complexity
of implementing a simultaneous stopping rule. Since we intend to impose an activity rule (as discussed below), we
believe that allowing simultaneous closing for all licenses will afford bidders flexibility to pursue back-up strategies
without running the risk that bidders will hold back their bidding until the final rounds. We also intend to use a simultaneous
stopping rule for BTA licenses. However, because of the large number of BTA licenses, we retain the discretion either
to use a hybrid stopping rule or to allow bidding to close individually for these licenses if as we gain experience with
auctions we determine that simultaneous stopping rules are too complex to implement for very large numbers of licenses.
The specific stopping rule for ending bidding on BTA licenses will be announced by Public Notice prior to auction.

48. In addition, we will retain the discretion to declare at any point after 40 rounds in a simultaneous multiple round
auction that the auction will end after some specified number of additional rounds.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 This gives the Commission a means to prevent bidders from continuing to bid on a few low value licenses solely to delay
the closing for all licenses in an auction with a simultaneous closing rule. This will also ensure that the Commission
can end the auction if it determines that the benefits from ending the auction, and hence issuing licenses more rapidly,
exceeds the possible efficiency loss from cutting off bidding on a few low value licenses. If we exercise this option,
we favor the use of three final rounds. Allowing more than one additional round provides some opportunity for counter-offers,
thus reducing the risk that a license will not be awarded to the party that values it most highly.

PacBell proposed that in case of inordinate delays in the auction the Commission should have the ability to conclude
the auction at any time after 40 rounds by issuing a call for final bids on the following business day for each of those
licenses for which the highest bid increased in at least 1 of the preceding 3 rounds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

49. Moreover, if this fail-safe mechanism is used, we will accept bids in the final round(s) only for licenses on which
the highest bid increased in at least one of the preceding three rounds. No new bids will be accepted for other licenses.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 There are two reasons not to take bids on licenses on which there has been no recent bidding. First, the fact that bidding
on an individual license may close will provide an additional incentive to bid actively and thus speed the conclusion
of the auction. If bids are accepted on all licenses in the final round(s) there is less cost to a bidder in holding back.
Second, closing bidding on licenses for which activity has ceased ensures high bidders for those licenses that they
will not lose a license without having an opportunity to make a counter-offer.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 This reduces the uncertainty associated with aggregating licenses that are worth more as a package than individually.
If final bids are accepted on all licenses, a high bidder on an aggregation of licenses may unexpectedly lose a critical
part of the aggregation and have no chance to regain it except in the post-auction market, where bargaining or other
transaction costs may be high.

Either the auction will close only when bidding ceases on all licenses, so the high bidder will have an opportunity
to respond to any new bids, or the Commission will call for final bids but not accept new bids on licenses on which there
have been no new bids in the previous three rounds, so no other bidder will have the opportunity to outbid the high bidder
in a final round.

4. Duration of Bidding Rounds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50. In simultaneous multiple round auctions for large numbers of interdependent high-value licenses, bidders may
need a significant amount of time to evaluate back-up strategies and consult with their principals. For this reason,
PacBell proposes one bidding round per day and PacTel proposes three business days per bidding round for broadband
PCS.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 We will provide bidders with a single business day to submit bids, and conduct one round of bidding each business day.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 However, we reserve the discretion to vary, by public notice or announcement, the duration of bidding rounds or the
interval at which bids are accepted (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 run two or more rounds per day rather than one), in order to move the auction toward closure more quickly. We are more
likely to conduct more than one round per day early in an auction than towards the end of an auction. At early stages of
an auction prices will be low and contain relatively little information, so bidders will need less time to deliberate.
It is in the final stages of an auction, when the consequences of bidding decisions are greatest, that bidders need
the most time to deliberate. We will indicate either by Public Notice prior to an auction, or by announcement during
an auction any changes to the duration of and intervals between bidding rounds.

With one round per day, the auction may take weeks to complete. This should not impose an excessive burden on bidders,
however, because bids may be submitted by telephone or by a computer connected to a telephone line, so bidders need
not have a representative in Washington throughout the auction.

5. Activity Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
51. As discussed above, in order to ensure that simultaneous auctions with simultaneous stopping rules close within
a reasonable period of time and to increase the information conveyed by bid prices during the auction, we believe that
it is necessary to impose an activity rule to prevent bidders from waiting until the end of the auction before participating.
Because simultaneous stopping rules generally keep all licenses open for bidding as long as anyone wishes to bid,
they also create an incentive for bidders to hold back until prices approach equilibrium before making a bid. As noted
above, this could lead to very long auctions. Delaying serious bidding until late in the auction also reduces the information
content of prices during the course of an auction. Without an activity rule, bidders cannot know whether a low level
of bidding on a license means that the license price is near its final level or if instead many serious bidders are holding
back and may bid up the price later in the auction.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 An activity rule is less important when licenses close one-by-one because failure to participate in any given round
may result in losing the opportunity to bid at all, if that round turns out to be the last.

52. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we adopted the Milgrom-Wilson activity rule as our preferred activity rule where a simultaneous stopping rule is
used. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at &para;&para;144&hyph;145. The Milgrom-Wilson approach encourages bidders to participate in early rounds by
limiting their maximum participation to some multiple of their minimum participation level. Bidders are required
to declare their maximum eligibility in terms of MHz-pops, and make an upfront payment equal to $0.02 per MHz-pop.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infra.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) That is, in each round bidders will be limited to bidding on licenses encompassing no more than the number of MHz-pops
covered by their upfront payment. Licenses on which a bidder is the high bidder from the previous round count against
this bidding limit. Under this approach, bidders will have the flexibility to shift their bids among any licenses
for which they have applied so long as, within each round, the total MHz-pops encompassed by those licenses does not
exceed the total number of MHz-pops on which they are eligible to bid. Bidders will be able to secure the option to participate
at whatever maximum level they deem appropriate by making a sufficient upfront payment. To preserve their maximum
eligibility, however, bidders will be required to maintain activity during each round of the auction. A bidder is
considered active on a license in the current round if the bidder has submitted an acceptable bid for that license in
the current round, or has the high bid for that license from the previous round, in which case, the bidder does not need
to bid on that license in the current round to be considered active on that license.

The number of ``MHz-pops'' is calculated by multiplying the population of the license service area by the amount of
spectrum authorized by the license. We use the terms ``per MHz-pop'' and ``per MHz per pop'' interchangeably.

53. Under the Milgrom-Wilson proposal, the minimum activity level, measured as a fraction of the bidder's eligibility
in the current round, will increase during the course of the auction.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 Milgrom and Wilson divide the auction into three stages. During the first stage of the auction, a bidder is required
to be active on licenses encompassing one-third of the MHz-pops for which it is eligible. The ``penalty'' for falling
below that activity level is a reduction in eligibility. At this stage, bidders will lose three MHz-pops in eligibility
for each MHz-pop below the minimum required activity level.
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 In the second stage, bidders are required to be active on two-thirds of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible. The
penalty for falling below that activity level is a loss of 1.5 MHz-pops in eligibility for each MHz-pop below the minimum
required activity level. In the third stage, bidders are required to be active on licenses encompassing all of the
MHz-pops for which they are eligible. The penalty for falling below that activity level is a loss of one MHz-pop in eligibility
for each MHz-pop below the minimum required activity level. Thus in the final stage, each bidder retains eligibility
(for the next round) equal to the MHz-pops for which it is an active bidder in the current round.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
infra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
), a bidder's eligibility (in terms of MHz-pops) in the current round is determined by the bidder's activity level
and eligibility in the previous round. In the first round, however, eligibility is determined by the bidder's upfront
payment and is equal to the upfront payment divided by $.02 per MHz-pop.

An alternative way to state the rule for determining eligibility in stage I of an auction is that each bidder will be
eligible to bid in the next round on three times the MHz-pops for which it is an active bidder in the current round, or
the MHz-pops for which it is eligible in the current round, whichever is less.

54. The auction will start in stage I and move from stage I to stage II when, in each of three consecutive rounds of bidding,
the high bid has increased on 10 percent or less of the spectrum (measured in terms of MHz-pops) being auctioned.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 The auction will move from stage II to stage III when the high bid has increased on 5 percent or less of the spectrum being
auctioned (measured in terms of MHz-pops), in each of three consecutive rounds of bidding in stage II.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 In order to speed up an auction, the Commission may also announce, at any time after the initial 15 rounds, that the next
stage of the auction (with a higher minimum participation level) will begin in the next bidding round.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, if as the Commission gains experience with auctions that use activity rules it determines that such auctions
tend to move too slowly, it may, by public notice prior to a specific auction, increase the activity levels at which
that auction moves between stages. Conversely, if the Commission determines that auctions tend to move too quickly,
depriving bidders of sufficient time to deliberate and pursue back-up strategies, it may decrease the activity levels
at which an auction moves between stages.

The transition rule may also be defined in terms of the ``auction activity level''_the sum of the MHz-pops of those
licenses whose highest bid increased in the current round, as a percentage of the total MHz-pops of all licenses in
that auction. (Note that this definition differs slightly from that used by Milgrom and Wilson.

See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
reply comments by PacBell, Appendix to attachment by Milgrom and Wilson at 1.) The auction moves from stage I to stage
II when the auction activity level is less than or equal to 10 percent for three consecutive rounds in stage I. The auction
moves from stage II to stage III when the auction activity level is less than or equal to 5 percent for three consecutive
rounds in stage II. For example, if two nationwide 30 MHz blocks of spectrum are put up for bid and the national population
is approximately 250 million, a total of approximately 15,000 million MHz-pops would be available in the auction.
If in stage I of the auction, the high bid increases on licenses encompassing less than 1,500 million MHz-pops for three
consecutive rounds, the auction moves to stage II. This would be the case, for example, if in three consecutive rounds
new bids were received on only a license for the New York MTA (26 million pops) and a license for the Los Angeles MTA (19
million pops), since the two licenses encompass a total of 1,350 million MHz-pops. Once in stage II, if in each of three
consecutive rounds new acceptable bids are received on licenses encompassing less than 750 million MHz-pops, the
auction would move to stage III.

55. Finally, to avoid the consequences of clerical errors and to compensate for unusual circumstances that might
delay a bidder's bid preparation or submission on a particular day, Milgrom and Wilson recommend permitting each
bidder to request and automatically receive a waiver of the activity rule once every three rounds. We believe that
some waiver procedure is a critical element of the Milgrom-Wilson activity rule, since the Commission would not wish
to reduce a bidder's eligibility due to an accidental act or circumstances not under the bidder's control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
56. We believe that the Milgrom-Wilson approach will best achieve the Commission's goals of affording bidders flexibility
to pursue backup strategies, while at the same time ensuring that simultaneous auctions are concluded within a reasonable
period of time. Accordingly, we plan to impose such an activity rule in conjunction with a simultaneous stopping rule
to award higher value broadband PCS licenses. We intend, however, to use a simpler waiver procedure than that proposed
by Milgrom and Wilson. We will permit bidders one automatic waiver from the activity rule during each stage of an auction.
A waiver will permit a bidder to maintain its eligibility at the same level as in the round for which the waiver is submitted.
<FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>
 A waiver may be submitted either in the round in which bidding falls below the minimum required level to maintain (for
the next round) the same eligibility as in that round, or prior to submitting a bid in the next round. If an activity rule
waiver is entered in a round in which no other bidding activity occurs, the auction will remain open.
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 However, an activity rule waiver entered after a round in which no other bidding activity occurs will not reopen the
auction. If, as we gain both experimental and actual auction experience, we determine that permitting one automatic
waiver per auction stage is insufficient to prevent the inadvertent reduction in eligibility of serious bidders,
we may, by public notice prior to a specific broadband auction, increase the number of automatic activity rule waivers,
or instead allow one automatic waiver during a specified number of bidding rounds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission established general competitive bidding rules and procedures which we noted may be modified on a service-specific
basis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR Part 1, subpart Q. As discussed below, we will generally follow the procedural, payment and penalty rules established
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with certain minor modifications designed to address the particular characteristics of the broadband PCS service.
These rules are structured to ensure that bidders and licensees are qualified and will be able to construct systems
quickly and other service to the public. By ensuring that bidders and license winners are serious, qualified applicants,
these rules will minimize the need to re-auction licenses and prevent delays in the provision of broadband PCS service
to the public. In addition, as we proposed in the Notice at &para; 129, we adopt general procedural and processing rules
based on Part 22 of the Commission's Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
59. Section 309(j)(5) provides that no party may participate in an auction ``unless such bidder submits such information
and assurances as the Commission may require to demonstrate that such bidder's application is acceptable for filing.''
47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(5). Moreover, ``[n]o license shall be granted to an applicant selected pursuant to this subsection
unless the Commission determines that the applicant is qualified pursuant to [Section 309(a)] and Sections 308(b)
and 310'' of the Communications Act.

id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As the legislative history of Section 309(j) makes clear, the Commission may require that bidders' applications
contain all information and documentation sufficient to demonstrate that the application is not in violation of
Commission rules, and applications not meeting those requirements may be dismissed prior to the competitive bidding.

60. In the MPRM, we proposed that all parties interested in participating in an auction for spectrum licenses would
be required to file a short-form application (modeled on the Commission's ``Transmittal Sheet for Cellular Applications''),
and asked whether applicants should also be required to submit a long-form application prior to the auction, or whether
the long-form application should be submitted subsequent to the auction. NPRM at &para; 97. The comments generally
agreed that we should require only a short-form application prior to competitive bidding, and that only winning bidders
should be required to submit a long-form license application after the auction. Because we believed that such a procedure
would fulfill the statutory requirements and objectives and adequately protect the public interest, we incorporated
these requirements into the rules adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order. See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR &sect;&sect;1.2105 and 1.2107. We will extend the application of these rules to the competitive bidding process
for broadband PCS.

61. We will be guided by the following procedures in conducting broadband PCS auctions. The Commission will release
an initial Public Notice announcing that it will accept applications for specific broadband PCS licenses. This initial
Public Notice will specify the licenses and identify the time and place of an auction in the event that mutually exclusive
applications are filed. The Public Notice also will specify the method of competitive bidding to be used, including
applicable bid submission procedures, stopping rules and activity rules, as well as the deadline by which short-form
applications must be filed, and the amounts and deadlines for submitting the upfront payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at &para; 164. We will not accept applications filed before or after the dates specified in Public Notices. Applications
submitted before release of a Public Notice announcing the availability of particular license(s), or before the
opening date of the filing window specified therein, will be returned as premature. Applications submitted after
the deadline specified by Public Notice will be dismissed, with prejudice, as untimely. Soon after release of the
initial Public Notice, an auction information package will be made available to prospective bidders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
62. Bidders will be required to submit short-form applications on FCC Form 175 (and FCC Form 175&hyph;S, if applicable),
together with any applicable filing fee
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 by the date specified in the initial Public Notice.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 The short-form applications will require applicants to provide the information required by Section 1.2105(a)(2)
of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR &sect;1.2105(a)(2). Specifically, each applicant will be required to specify
on its Form 175 applications certain identifying information, including its status as a designated entity (if applicable),
its classification (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
individual, corporation, partnership, trust or other), the markets and frequently blocks for which it is applying,
and assuming that the licenses will be auctioned, the names of persons authorized to place or withdraw a bid on its behalf.
In addition, applicants will be required to provide detailed ownership information (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 24.813(a) of the Commission's Rules) and identify all parties with whom they have entered into any consortium
arrangements, joint ventures, partnerships or other agreements or understandings which relate to the competitive
bidding process. Applicants will also be required to certify that they have not entered and will not enter into any
explicit or implicit agreements, arrangements or understandings with any parties, other than those identified,
regarding the amount of their bid, bidding strategies or the particular properties on which they will or will not bid.
In addition, applicants for licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks will be required, as part of their short-form applications,
to certify that they are eligible to bid on and win licenses in those blocks. Among other things, this means that they
are in compliance with our PCS-cellular and PCS&hyph;PCS cross-ownership limitations. As we indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, if the Commission receives only one application that is acceptable for filing for a particular license, and thus
there is no mutual exclusivity, the Commission by Public Notice will cancel the auction for this license and establish
a date for the filing of a long-form application, the acceptance of which will trigger the procedures permitting petitions
to deny. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Because Section 8 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. &sect;158, does not currently afford the Commission authority
to charge an application fee in connection with PCS applications, broadband PCS applicants will not be required to
submit a fee with their short-form application. However, the Commission has requested that Congress amend Section
8 of the Communications Act to provide a specific application fee for PCS services. If the Commission receives application
fee authority, the general rules governing submission of fees will apply.

. These rules currently provide for dismissal of an application if the application fee is not paid, is insufficient,

63. A number of commenters in this proceeding objected to our original tentative conclusion that short-form applications
should be judged by a letter-perfect standard. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NPRM at &para; 100. Parties proposed that the Commission allow a brief period for correcting errors in short-form
applications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we believe that the public interest would be better served by encouraging maximum bidder participation in auctions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

applications (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
typographical errors, incorrect license designations, etc.) prior to the auction. Applicants will not be permitted
until after the auction, however, to make any major modifications to their applications, including cognizable ownership
changes or changes in the identification of parties to bidding consortia. In addition, applications that are not
signed will be dismissed as unacceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
64. After reviewing the short-form applications, the Commission will issue a second Public Notice listing all defective
applications, and applicants whose applications contain minor defects will be given an opportunity to cure defective
applications and resubmit a correction version.
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 After reviewing the corrected applications, the Commission will release a third Public Notice announcing the names
of all applicants whose applications have been accepted for filing. These applicants will be required to submit an
upfront payment to the Commission, as discussed below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
65. The comments in this proceeding generally supported the Commission's proposal to require prospective bidders
to make substantial upfront payments prior to auction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
comments of Comcast at 18, PacBell at 28, Nextel at 16, and AWCC at 31&hyph;32. Consistent with the weight of the comments,
we concluded in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that a substantial upfront payment prior to the beginning of an auction is necessary to ensure that only serious and
qualified bidders participate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para; 171. By requiring such a payment we also help to ensure that any bid withdrawal or default penalties are paid.
These considerations apply to broadband PCS auctions. We will therefore require all broadband PCS auction participants
to tender in advance to the Commission a substantial upfront payment as a condition of bidding.

66. In the Notice, we proposed to require upfront payments based on a $0.02 per MHz per pop formula. Though some commenters
favor a fixed upfront payment set by the Commission prior to the auction,
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 most support the Commission's proposed $0.02 per MHz per pop formula, which would enable prospective bidders to tailor
their upfront payment to their bidding strategies.
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 Commenters suggest that there should be some fixed minimum on the amount of upfront payment made prior to auction (suggestions
range from $2,500 to $100,000 for different services).
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 Some commenters also favor setting a maximum upfront payment, pointing out that our proposed formula yields very
high payments in the broadband PCS context.

67. We believe that the standard upfront payment formula of $0.02 per pop per MHz for the largest combination of MHz-pops
a bidder anticipates bidding on in any single round of bidding is appropriate for broadband PCS services.
<FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>
 Using this formula will provide bidders with the flexibility to change their strategy during an auction and to bid
on a larger number of smaller licenses or a smaller number of larger licenses, so long as the total MHz-pops combination
does not exceed that amount covered by the upfront payment. For example, when we auction licenses covering the nation
simultaneously, a bidder would not be required to file an upfront payment representing national coverage unless
it intended to bid on licenses covering the entire nation in a single bidding round. The $0.02 per MHz per pop formula
also works well with the Milgrom-Wilson activity rule that we plan to employ in broadband PCS auctions, as described
in Section III above. In the initial Public Notice issued prior to each auction, we will announce population information
corresponding to each license to enable bidders to calculate their upfront payments.

infra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, designated entities will be subject to a lesser upfront payment requirement of $0.015 per MHz per pop. Further, we
retain the flexibility to consider using a simpler payment requirement if circumstances warrant.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we will not set a maximum on upfront payments.
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 We decline to do so because we wish to ensure that those bidding on large numbers of valuable broadband PCS licenses
are bidding in good faith and are financially capable of constructing those systems quickly. We recognize that upfront
payments for broadband PCS licenses may amount to millions of dollars, but we do not believe that it is unreasonable
to expect prospective bidders to tender such sums given the expected overall value of some of these licenses and the
expected financial requirements to construct the systems. Indeed, such a requirement is necessary to ensure the
seriousness of bidders for these valuable licenses.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we accepted commenters' suggestions and established a general minimum upfront payment of $2,500 to ensure that
the use of our preferred formula would result in a substantial enough payment that bidders would be deterred from making
frivolous bids.
<FOOTCITE>47</FOOTCITE>
 Such a minimum upfront payment is needed in connection with auctions where the $0.02 per MHz per pop formula would yield
a comparatively small upfront payment (such as those for narrowband PCS licenses in BTAs). Because of the wider bandwidth
of broadband PCS licenses, however, this minimum upfront payment will not be relevant in auctions for this service.

The smallest bandwidth that a broadband PCS licensee will be authorized to use is 10 MHz, so a $2,500 upfront payment
would result for a license area with a population of only 12,500 persons. The least populous BTA in the United States
(Williston, North Dakota) has a population of approximately 27,500, and the upfront payment for a 10 MHz license in
that BTA would be approximately $5,500.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Applicants whose short-form applications have been accepted for filing will be required to submit the full amount
of their upfront payment to the Commission's lock-box bank by a date certain, which will be announced in a Public Notice
and generally will be no later than 14 days before the scheduled auction.
<FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>
 After the Commission receives from its lock-box bank the names of all applicants who have submitted timely upfront
payments, the Commission will issue a Public Notice announcing the names of all applicants that have been determined
to be qualified to bid. An applicant who fails to submit a sufficient upfront payment to qualify it to bid on any license
being auctioned will not be identified on this Public Notice as a qualified bidder, and it will be prohibited from bidding
in the auction. That is, we will require that applicants for broadband PCS licenses submit a sufficient upfront payment
to reflect the MHz-pops of the smallest license being put up for bid in a particular auction.

For example, in our first broadband PCS auction (the 30 MHz MTA licenses on blocks A and B), the smallest upfront payment
that may be submitted to qualify an applicant to bid will be calculated by multiplying the population of the least populous
MTA (American Samoa: population 47,000) times 30 times two cents, or $28,200. It should be noted, however, that this
minimal upfront payment will entitle the bidder to bid only on a license to serve American Samoa.

71. Although it would be simpler to require the submission of upfront payments at the same time short-form applications
are filed, we agree with those commenters that argued that they should not be required to commit the large sums that
will likely be involved in broadband PCS upfront payment for longer than is necessary. Accordingly, applicants will
not be required to tender upfront payments with their short-form applications. Instead, as noted above, upfront
payments will be due by a date specified by Public Notice, but generally no later than 14 days before a scheduled auction.
This period should be sufficient to allow the Commission adequate time to process upfront payment data and release
a Public Notice listing all qualified bidders, but not so long as to impose undue burdens upon bidders. The rules set
forth in Section 1.2106 of the Commission's Rules concerning upfront payments will be applicable in broadband PCS
auctions. Each qualified bidder will be issued a bidder identification number and further information and instructions
regarding the auction procedures. During an auction, bidders will be required to provide their bidder identification
numbers when submitting bids.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 established a 20 percent down payment by winning bidders to discourage default between the auction and licensing
and to ensure payment of the penalty if such default occurs. We concluded that a 20 percent down payment was appropriate
to ensure that auction winners have the necessary financial capabilities to complete payment for the license and
to pay for the costs of constructing a system, while at the same time not being so onerous as to hinder growth or diminish
access. Most of the commenters addressing this issue generally support our proposal that winning bidders increase
their deposits with the Commission up to an amount equalling 20 percent of their winning bid or bids.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, comments of BellSouth at 43&hyph;44, PageNet at 35&hyph;36, and Telocator at 13. Some commenters feel that a 20 percent
down payment requirement would be too high.

 comments of Sprint at 18 (prefers a 10 percent down payment).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
73. We believe that the reasoning that led us to conclude that 20 percent is the appropriate down payment applies to
broadband PCS auctions. We therefore will require that, with the exception of bidders eligible for installment payments
in the entrepreneurs' blocks (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), winning bidders in broadband PCS auctions supplement their upfront payments with a down payment sufficient to
bring their total deposits up to 20 percent of their winning bid(s).
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>
 Winning bidders will be required to submit the required down payment by cashier's check or wire transfer to our lock-box
bank by a date to be specified by Public Notice, generally within five (5) business days following the close of bidding.
All auction winners will generally be required to make full payment of the balance of their winning bids within five
(5) business days following award of the license. Grant of the license will be conditioned on this payment.

If the upfront payment already tendered by a winning bidder, after deducting any bid withdrawal and default penalties
due, amounts to 20 percent or more of its winning bids, no additional deposit will be required. If the upfront payment
amount on deposit is greater than 20 percent of the winning bid amount after deducting any bid withdrawal and default
penalties due, the additional monies will be refunded. If a bidder has withdrawn a bid or defaulted but the amount of
the penalty cannot yet be determined, the bidder will be required to make a deposit of 20 percent of the amount bid on
such licenses. When it becomes possible to calculate and assess the penalty, any excess deposit will be refunded.
Upfront payments will be applied to such deposits and to bid withdrawal and default penalties due before being applied
toward the bidder's down payment on licenses the bidder has won and seeks to acquire.

Commission up to only 5 percent of its winning bid after the bidding closes, and will pay an additional 5 percent of its
winning bid to the Commission after a license is granted.

2. Bid Withdrawal and Default Penalties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
75. As we discussed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, it is critically important to the success of our system of competitive bidding that potential bidders understand
that there will be a substantial penalty assessed if they withdraw a high bid, are found not to be qualified to hold licenses
or default on payment of a balance due. There was substantial support in the comments for the notion that the Commission
is authorized to and should order forfeiture of upfront and down payments if the auction winner later defaults or is
disqualified. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, comments of CTIA at 29&hyph;30, AT&amp;T at 35, n.43, PageNet at 35&hyph;36, Cook Inlet at 47, and BellSouth at 42&hyph;44.
We concluded, however, that forfeiture of all amounts that a bidder may have on deposit with the Commission may, in
some circumstances, be too severe a penalty and would not necessarily be rationally related to the harm caused by withdrawal,
default or disqualification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para; 197.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
76. This logic applies to broadband PCS auctions, so for these auctions we will employ the bid withdrawal, default
and disqualification penalties adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which are reflected in Sections 1.2104(g) and 1.2109 of the Commission's Rules. Any bidder who withdraws a high bid
during an auction before the Commission declares bidding closed will be required to reimburse the Commission in the
amount of the difference between its high bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by
the Commission, if this subsequent winning bid is lower than the withdrawn bid.
<FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>
 No withdrawal penalty will be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds the withdrawn bid. After bidding closes,
a defaulting auction winner (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a winner who fails to remit the required down payment within the prescribed time, fails to pay for a license, or is otherwise
disqualified) will be assessed an additional penalty of three percent of the subsequent winning bid or three percent
of the amount of the defaulting bid, whichever is less. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR &sect;&sect;1.2104(g) and 1.2109. The additional three percent penalty is designed to encourage bidders
who wish to withdraw their bids to do so before bidding ceases. We will hold deposits made by defaulting or disqualified
auction winners until full payment of the penalty.
<FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>
 We believe that these penalties will adequately discourage default and ensure that bidders have adequate financing
and that they meet all eligibility and qualification requirements. As we explained in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we further believe that this approach is well within our authority under both Section 309(j)(4)(B) and Section 4(i)
of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. &sect;154(i), as it is clearly necessary to carry out the rapid deployment of
new technologies through the use of auctions.

If a license is re-offered by auction, the ``winning bid'' refers to the high bid in the auction in which the license
is re-offered. If a license is re-offered in the same auction, the winning bid refers to the high bid amount, made subsequent
to the withdrawal, in that auction. If the subsequent high bidder also withdraws its bid, that bidder will be required
to pay a penalty equal to the difference between its withdrawn bid and the amount of the subsequent winning bid the next
time the license is offered by the Commission. If a license which is the subject of withdrawal or default is not re-auctioned,
but is instead offered to the highest losing bidders in the initial auction, the ``winning bid'' refers to the bid of
the highest bidder who accepts the offer. Losing bidders would not be required to accept the offer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, they may decline without penalty. We wish to encourage losing bidders in simultaneous multiple round auctions to
bid on other licenses, and therefore we will not hold them to their losing bids on a license for which a bidder has withdrawn
a bid or on which a bidder has defaulted.

77. In addition, if a default or disqualification involves gross misconduct, misrepresentation or bad faith by an
applicant, the Commission may declare the applicant and its principals ineligible to bid in future auctions, and
may take any other action that it deems necessary, including institution of proceedings to revoke any existing licenses
held by the applicant.

3. Re-Offering Licenses When Auction Winners Default

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
78. In the event that an auction winner defaults or is otherwise disqualified, the Commission must determine whether
to hold a new auction or simply offer the license to the second-highest bidder. Parties commenting on this issue generally
favored re-auctioning the license, pointing out that changing market and even technological developments since
the initial auction may change the amounts that bidders are willing to pay for a license, especially if the intervening
period is relatively long. They urge that any re-auction be open to new bidders, arguing that such a procedure would
reduce the incentive of losing bidders to file unmeritorious petitions to deny against the auction winner. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
comments of BellSouth at 37, Utilities Telecommunications Council at 21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79. As we stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we believe that, as a general rule, when an auction winner defaults or is otherwise disqualified after having made
the required down payment, the best course of action is to re-auction the license. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;204. Although we recognize that this may cause a brief delay in the initiation of service to the public, during
the time between the original auction and the disqualification circumstances may have changed so significantly
as to alter the value of the license to auction participants as well as to parties who did not participate. In this situation,
awarding licenses to the parties that value them most highly can best be assured through a re-auction. However, if
the default occurs within five (5) business days after the bidding has closed, the Commission retains the discretion
to offer the license to the second highest bidder at its final bid level, or if that bidder declines the offer, to offer
the license to other bidders (in descending order of their bid amounts) at the final bid levels.

If only a small number of relatively low-value licenses are to be re-auctioned and only a short time has passed since
the initial auction, the Commission may choose to offer the license to the highest losing bidders because the cost
of running another auction may exceed the benefits.

80. If a new auction becomes necessary because of default or disqualification more than five (5) business days after
bidding has ended, the Commission will afford new parties an opportunity to file applications. One of our primary
goals in conducting auctions is to assure that all serious interested bidders are in the pool of qualified bidders
at any re-auction. We believe that allowing new applications will promote achievement of this goal, which outweighs
the short delay that we recognize may result from allowing new applications in a re-auction. Indeed, if we were not
to allow new applicants in a re-auction, interested parties might be forced into an after-market transaction to obtain
the license, which would itself delay service to the public and may prevent the public from recovering a reasonable
portion of the value of the spectrum resource.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
81. If the winning bidder makes the down payment in a timely manner, a long-form application filed on FCC Form 401 (as
modified), or such other form as may be adopted for Commercial Mobile Radio Service use in GEN Docket No. 93&hyph;252,
will be required to be filed by a date specified by Public Notice, generally within ten (10) business days after the
close of bidding.
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 After the Commission receives the winning bidder's down payment and the long-form application, we will review the
long-form application to determine if it is acceptable for filing. In addition to the information required in the
long-form application of all winning bidders, each winning bidder on licenses in frequency blocks C and F will be required
to submit evidence of its eligibility to bid on licenses in these blocks, as well as evidence to support its claim to
any special provisions made available to designated entities. This information may be included in an exhibit to FCC
Form 401, and must include the gross revenues and total assets of the applicant and all attributable investors in the
applicant, and a certification that the personal net worth of each individual investor does not exceed the eligibility
limitation. This information will enable the Commission, and other interested parties, to ensure the validity of
the applicant's certification of eligibility to bid in blocks C and F (submitted as part of its FCC Form 175) and its
eligibility for any bidding credits, installment payment options, or other special provision. Upon acceptance
for filing of the long-form application, the Commission will issue a Public Notice announcing this fact, triggering
the filing window for petitions to deny. If the Commission denies all petitions to deny, and is otherwise satisfied
that the applicant is qualified, the license(s) will be granted to the auction winner.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
82. In the Notice, we proposed to adopt general processing and procedural rules for broadband PCS based on Part 22 of
the Commission's Rules. One commenter, AIDE, argues that the Commission's reference to proposed PCS rules is vague
and legally insufficient for a Notice of Proposed Rule Making. Comments of AIDE at 16&hyph;17. AIDE also asserts that
the adoption of PCS processing and procedural rules is beyond the scope of the Notice in this rule making proceeding.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree. The Notice sought comment on specific rule sections contained in Part 22 of our Rules and asked commenters
to indicate what modifications should be made to those rules to adapt them for PCS services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice at &para;128. In addition, the Notice specifically requested comment on the general procedural, processing
and petition to deny procedures that should be used for auctionable services. The Notice's proposal to adopt processing
rules based on Part 22 of the Commission's Rules, with any appropriate modifications for PCS services, clearly indicated
to commenters the terms of the proposed rules, as is required by 5 U.S.C. &sect;553 and 47 CFR &sect;1.413(c). Accordingly,
we believe that the Notice's description of the proposed rules was sufficiently specific to alert interested parties
to the substance of our proposal and to provide an adequate opportunity for comment on those proposals. Moreover,
we conclude that these issues are well within the scope of the Notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
83. As we proposed, we adopt for broadband PCS a modified version of the application processing rules contained in
Part 22 of the Commission's Rules. These rules, which will comprise Subpart I of Part 24 of our Rules, will govern application
filing and content requirements, waiver procedures for return of defective applications, regulations regarding
modification of applications, and general application processing rules. We also adopt petition to deny procedures
based on Section 22.30 of the Commission's Rules. In addition, as we proposed in the Notice, we adopt rules similar
to Sections 22.927, 22.928 and 22.929 of our existing rules (47 CFR &sect;&sect;22.927, 22.928, 22.929) to prevent
the filing of speculative applications and pleadings (or threats of the same) designed to extract money from sincere
broadband PCS applicants. In this regard, we limit the consideration that an applicant or petitioner is permitted
to receive for agreeing to withdraw an application or a petition to deny to the legitimate and prudent expenses of the
withdrawing applicant or petitioner.

will incorporate these principles into our broadband PCS procedural rules.

86. If we decide to employ a sequential auction design (using either oral or electronic bid submission), the same general
rules and procedures described above will be used with certain modifications to fit the oral or electronic auction
format. In the case of oral auctions, bidders would be required to follow the procedures described above, including
the submission of the standard upfront payment of $0.02 per MHz-pop prior to the auction. Applicants would submit
a sufficient upfront payment to cover the total number of MHz-pops they desire to win. Once a bidder has won the maximum
number of MHz-pops covered by its upfront payment, that bidder will be precluded from further bidding in the auction.
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 Immediately after bidding closes on a license, the winning bidder (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the high bidder on a license on which bidding has closed) will be asked to sign a bid confirmation form. No other license
will be put up for bid until a bid confirmation form is signed by a high bidder on the previous license.
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 Because we recognize that in an oral auction the chances of a bidder accidentally placing a high bid are greater than
in other auction methods, and because the harm will be limited if the license is immediately re-offered, we will not
impose a penalty on a high bidder who withdraws a high bid by refusing to sign the bid confirmation form. Thus, in an sequential
oral auction in which a high bidder declines to sign the bid confirmation form, the license will be immediately put
up for bid again. If, however, a high bidder signs a bid confirmation form but subsequently fails to submit the 20 percent
down payment or otherwise defaults, the standard default penalties (described 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

87. If we decide to use sequential electronic bidding, bidders would again follow the general procedures described
above including the submission of the standard upfront payment amount of $0.02 per MHz per pop prior to the auction.
Applicants would submit a sufficient upfront payment to cover the total number of MHz-pops they desire to win. An applicant
will not be eligible to bid on a license for which it has not applied or which contains more MHz-pops than the total MHz-pops
covered by the bidder's upfront payment less any MHz-pops already won by that bidder. Once a bidder has won licenses
representing the maximum number of MHz-pops reflected in its upfront payment, that bidder will be precluded from
further bidding in the auction. Each bidder's eligibility will be computed and tracked by the auction software and
bids placed by ineligible bidders will not be accepted. After the auctioneer declares bidding on a license closed
and the high bidder has been notified, that bidder will be asked to confirm its high bid. If the high bidder in a sequential
electronic auction declines to confirm its high bid, the license will be immediately re-auctioned and no penalty
will be imposed. No other licenses will be put up for bid until a bid confirmation form is signed by a high bidder on the
previous license.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
88. In Section 309(j), Congress directed the Commission to ``require such transfer disclosures and anti-trafficking
restrictions and payment schedules as may be necessary to prevent unjust enrichment as a result of the methods employed
to issue licenses and permits.'' 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(4)(E). In the Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Commission adopted safeguards designed to ensure that the requirements of Section 309(j)(4)(E) are satisfied.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

See Second Report and Order

89. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(at &para;214), we stated our belief that it is important to monitor transfers of licenses awarded by competitive
bidding in order to accumulate the data necessary to evaluate our auction designs and to judge whether ``licenses
[have been] issued for bids that fall short of the true market value of the license.'' H.R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;111 at
257. Therefore, we imposed a transfer disclosure requirement on licenses obtained through the competitive bidding
process, whether by a designated entity or not. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
47 CFR &sect;1.2111(a). We believe that the transfer disclosure requirements contained in Section 1.2111(a) of
the Commission's Rules should apply to all broadband PCS licenses obtained through the competitive bidding process.
Generally, licensees transferring their licenses within three years after the initial license grant will be required
to file, together with their transfer applications, the associated contracts for sale, option agreements, management
agreements, and all other documents disclosing the total consideration received in return for the transfer of its
license. As we indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we will give particular scrutiny to auction winners who have not yet begun commercial service and who seek approval
for a transfer of control or assignment of their licenses within three years after the initial license grant, in order
to determine if any unforeseen problems relating to unjust enrichment have arisen outside the designated entity
context.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
90. The Budget Act requires the Commission to ``include performance requirements, such as appropriate deadlines
and penalties for performance failures, to ensure prompt delivery of service to rural areas, to prevent stockpiling
or warehousing of spectrum by licensees or permittees, and to promote investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies
and services.''
<FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we decided that it was unnecessary and undesirable to impose additional performance requirements, beyond those
already provided in the service rules, for all auctionable services. The broadband PCS service rules already contain
specific performance requirements, such as the requirement to construct within a specified period of time. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR &sect;24.203. Failure to satisfy these construction requirements will result in forfeiture of the license.
Accordingly, we do not see the need to adopt any additional performance requirements in this Report and Order.

C. Rules Prohibiting Collusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
91. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we adopted a special rule prohibiting collusive conduct in the context of competitive bidding. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR &sect;1.2105(c). We referred to the Notice, wherein we indicated our belief that such a rule would serve the
objectives of the Budget Act by preventing parties, especially the largest firms, from agreeing in advance to bidding
strategies that divide the market according to their strategic interests and disadvantage other bidders. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para;221. We believe that this rule is nowhere more necessary than with respect to broadband PCS auctions, where
we expect bidder interest to be high and the incentives to collude to be great. Thus, Section 1.2105(c) will apply to
broadband PCS auctions. This rule provides that from the time the short-form applications are filed until the winning
bidder has made its required down payment, all bidders will be prohibited from cooperating, collaborating, discussing
or disclosing in any manner the substance of their bids or bidding strategies with other bidders, unless such bidders
are members of a bidding consortium or other joint bidding arrangement identified on the bidder's short-form application.
In addition, as discussed in Section IV, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
supra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, bidders will be required by Section 1.2105(a)(2) of the Commission's Rules to identify on their Form 175 applications
all parties with whom they have entered into any consortium arrangements, joint ventures, partnerships or other
agreements or understandings which relate to the competitive bidding process. Bidders will also be required to certify
that they have not entered and will not enter into any explicit or implicit agreements, arrangements or understandings
with any parties, other than those identified, regarding the amount of their bid, bidding strategies or the particular
properties on which they will or will not bid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
92. Winning bidders in broadband PCS auctions will also be subject to Section 1.2107 of the Commission's Rules, which
among other things requires each winning bidder to attach as an exhibit to the Form 401 long-form application a detailed
explanation of the terms and conditions and parties involved in any bidding consortium, joint venture, partnership,
or other agreement or arrangement they had entered into relating to the competitive bidding process prior to the close
of bidding. All such arrangements must have been entered into prior to the filing of short-form applications. In addition,
where specific instances of collusion in the competitive bidding process are alleged during the petition to deny
process, the Commission may conduct an investigation or refer such complaints to the United States Department of
Justice for investigation. Bidders who are found to have violated the antitrust laws or the Commission's rules in
connection with participation in the auction process may be subject to forfeiture of their down payment or their full
bid amount and revocation of their license(s), and they may be prohibited from participating in future auctions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overview and Objectives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
93. Congress mandated that the Commission ``ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses
owned by members of minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based
services.'' 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(4)(D). To achieve this goal, the statute requires the Commission to ``consider
the use of tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other procedures.'' Thus, while providing that we charge for
licenses, Congress has ordered that the Commission design its auction procedures to ensure that designated entities
have opportunities to obtain licenses and provide service. For that purpose, the law does not mandate the use of any
particular procedure, but it specifically approves the use of ``tax certificates, bidding preferences, and other
procedures.'' The use of any such procedure is, in our view, mandated where necessary to achieve Congress's objective
of ensuring that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in broadband PCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
94. In addition to this mandate, the statute sets forth various congressional objectives. For example, it provides
that in establishing eligibility criteria and bidding methodologies the Commission shall ``promot[e] economic
opportunity and competition and ensur[e] that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American
people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants,
including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. &sect;309(j)(4)(C) (requiring the Commission when prescribing area designations and bandwidth assignments,
to promote ``economic opportunity for a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone
companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women).
<FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>
 Further, Section 309(j)(4)(A) provides that to promote the statute's objectives the Commission shall ``consider
alternative payment schedules and methods of calculation, including lump sums or guaranteed installment payments,
with or without royalty payments, or other schedules or methods *&blank;*&blank;* and combinations of such schedules
and methods.''

64
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the Second Report and Order, the statute also requires the Commission to promote the purposes specified
in Section 1 of the Communications Act, which include, among other things, ``to make available, so far as possible,
to all the people of the United States a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication
service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.'' 47 U.S.C. &sect;151; Second Report and Order at n. 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
95. To satisfy these statutory mandates and objectives, we established in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eligibility criteria and general rules that would govern the special measures for small businesses, rural telephone
companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women. We also identified several measures, including
installment payments, spectrum set-asides, bidding credits and tax certificates, that we could choose from in establishing
rules for auctionable spectrum-based services. We stated that we would decide whether and how to use these special
provisions, or others, when we developed specific competitive bidding rules for particular services. In addition,
we set forth rules designed to prevent unjust enrichment by designated entities who transfer ownership in licenses
obtained through the use of these special measures or who otherwise lose their designated entity status.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
96. We intend in the new broadband personal communications service to meet fully the statutory mandate of Section
309(j)(4)(D), as well as the objectives of promoting economic opportunity and competition, of avoiding excessive
concentration of licenses, and of ensuring access to new and innovative technologies by disseminating licenses
among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned
by members of minority groups and women. As explained more fully in this Order, in some respects it is necessary to do
more to ensure that businesses owned by members of minority groups and women have a meaningful opportunity to participate
in the provision of personal communications services than is necessary to ensure participation by other designated
entities. In particular, we have concluded that steps such as adoption of bidding credits, tax certificates, alternate
payment plans and relaxed attribution rules, must be taken to encourage investment in minority and women-owned businesses.
These special provisions are tailored to address the major problem facing minorities and women desiring to offer
PCS_lack of access to capital. Moreover, because broadband PCS licenses in many cases are expected to be auctioned
for large sums of money in the competitive bidding process, and because buildout costs are likely to be high, it is necessary
to do more to ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in broadband PCS than is necessary
in other, less costly spectrum-based services. In our view, these steps and the others we adopt are required to fulfill
Congress' mandate that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in the provision of PCS. The measures
we adopt today will also increase the likelihood that designated entities who win licenses in the auctions become
strong competitors in the provision of broadband PCS service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
97. In instructing the Commission to ensure the opportunity for designated entities to participate in auctions and
spectrum-based services, Congress was well aware of the difficulties these groups encounter in accessing capital.
Indeed, less than two years ago, Congress made specific findings in the Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity
Enhancement Act of 1992, that ``small business concerns, which represent higher degrees of risk in financial markets
than do large businesses, are experiencing increased difficulties in obtaining credit.''
<FOOTCITE>65</FOOTCITE>
 Because of these problems, Congress resolved to consider carefully legislation and regulations ``to ensure that
small business concerns are not negatively impacted'' and to give priority to passage of ``legislation and regulations
that enhance the viability of small business concerns.''

98. Congress also recognized that these funding problems are even more severe for minority and women-owned businesses,
who face discrimination in the private lending market. For example, Congress explicitly found that businesses owned
by minorities and women have particular difficulties in obtaining capital and that problems encountered by minorities
in this regard are ``extraordinary.''
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 A number of studies also amply support the existence of widespread discrimination against minorities in lending
practices. In October 1992, the year prior to passage of the auction law, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released
an important and highly-publicized study demonstrating that a black or Hispanic applicant in the Boston area is roughly
60 percent more likely to be denied a mortgage loan than a similarly situated white applicant.
<FOOTCITE>68</FOOTCITE>
 The researchers measured every variable mentioned as important in numerous conversations with lenders, underwriters,
and examiners and found that minority applicants are more likely to be denied mortgages even where they have the same
obligation ratios, credit history, loan to value and property characteristics as white applicants. The lending
discrimination that occurs, the study found, does not involve the application of specific rules, but instead occurs
where discretionary decisions are made. Based on the Boston study, it is reasonable to expect that race would affect
business loans that are based on more subjective criteria to an even greater extent than the mortgage loan process,
which uses more standard rules.

99. Importantly, the Boston study also found that, because most loan applicants have some negative attributes, most
loan denials will appear legitimate by some objective standard. Accordingly, the study stated, the lending discrimination
that occurs is very difficult to document at the institution level, so legal remedies may be largely ineffective.
Indeed, Congress had already attempted to address discriminatory lending practices through laws that bar discrimination
in lending, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, enacted in 1974 and amended many times since then. Congress,
therefore, could reasonably assume, based on the Boston study, and its legislative experience regarding discriminatory
lending practices, that minority applicants for licenses issued in spectrum auctions would face substantial (albeit
subtle) barriers to obtaining financing. Any legal remedies, even if effective, would, moreover, come too late to
ensure that minorities are able to participate in spectrum auctions and obtain licenses.

100. Similar evidence presented in testimony before the House Minority Enterprise Subcommittee on May 20, 1994 indicates
that African American business borrowers have difficulty raising capital mainly because they have less equity to
invest, they receive fewer loan dollars per dollar of equity investment, and they are less likely to have alternate
loan sources, such as affluent family or friends. Assuming two hypothetical college educated, similarly-situated
male entrepreneurs, one black, one white, the testimony indicated that the white candidate would have access to $1.85
in bank loans for each dollar of owner equity invested, while the black candidate would have access to only $1.16. According
to the testimony, the problems associated with lower incomes and intergenerational wealth, as well as the discriminatory
treatment minorities receive from financial institutions, make it much more likely that minorities will be shut
out of capital intensive industries, such as telecommunications. This testimony also noted that African American
representation in communications is so low that it was not possible to generate meaningful summary statistics on
underrepresentation.

101. The inability to access capital is also a major impediment to the successful participation of women in broadband
PCS auctions. In enacting the Women's Business Ownership Act in 1988, Congress made findings that women, as a group,
are subject to discrimination that adversely affects their ability to raise or secure capital.
<FOOTCITE>70</FOOTCITE>
 As AWRT documents, these discriminatory barriers still exist today. Indeed, AWRT reports that while venture capital
is an important source of funding for telecommunications companies, women-owned companies received only approximately
one percent of the $3 billion invested by institutional venture capitalists in 1993. Citing a 1992 National Women's
Business Council report, AWRT further argues that even successful women-owned companies did not overcome these
financing obstacles after they had reached a level of funding and profitability adequate for most other businesses.

102. A study prepared in 1993 by the National Foundation for Women Business Owners (NFWBO) further illustrates the
barriers faced by women-owned businesses. For example, it finds that women-owned firms are 22 percent more likely
to report problems dealing with their banks than are businesses at large. In addition, the NFWBO study finds that the
largest single type of short-term financing used by women business owners is credit cards and that over half of women-owned
firms use credit cards for such purposes, as compared to 18 percent of all small to medium-sized businesses, which
generally use bank loans and vendor credit for short-term credit needs. With regard to long-term financing, the study
states that a greater proportion of women-owned firms are turning, or are forced to turn, to private sources, and to
a wider variety of sources, to fulfill their needs. Based on these findings, the NFWBO study concludes that removal
of financial barriers would encourage stronger growth among women-owned businesses, resulting in much greater
growth throughout the economy.

103. If we are to meet the congressional goals of promoting economic opportunity and competition by disseminating
licenses among a wide variety of providers, we must find ways to counteract these barriers to entry. Over the years,
both Congress and the Commission have tried various methods to enhance access to the broadcast and cable industries
by minorities and women. For example, in the late 1960s, the FCC began to promote nondiscriminatory employment policies
by broadcast licensees. These equal employment opportunity efforts have taken the form of Commission rules and policies
that require licensees not to discriminate, to report hiring and promotion statistics, and to implement affirmative
action programs.
<FOOTCITE>73</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission also has adopted similar equal employment rules for licensees in the common carrier, public mobile,
and international fixed public radio communication services,
<FOOTCITE>74</FOOTCITE>
 as well for cable operators.
<FOOTCITE>75</FOOTCITE>
 The cable EEO rules were recently revised as part of the implementation of the Cable Act of 1992, and they now apply to
cable entities, satellite master antenna television operators serving 50 or more subscribers and any multichannel
video programming distributor.

104. A decade after it first addressed discriminatory hiring practices, the Commission began to look into the serious
underrepresentation of minorities among owners of broadcast stations. Recognizing that it could play an important
role in alleviating this problem through the licensing process, the Commission adopted its tax certificate and distress
sale policies in 1978 to encourage minority ownership of broadcast facilities.
<FOOTCITE>77</FOOTCITE>
 It noted that full minority participation in the ownership and management of broadcast facilities would result in
a more diverse selection of programming and would inevitably enhance the diversity of control of a valuable resource,

105. In implementing these ownership policies, the Commission identified lack of access to capital as one of the principal
barriers to minority entry. Thus, in 1981, the Commission created the Advisory Committee on Alternative Financing
for Minority Opportunities in Telecommunications (the ``Rivera Committee'') to investigate financing methods
and to give recommendations to the FCC on ways to encourage minority ownership of telecommunications facilities.
<FOOTCITE>79</FOOTCITE>
 The Rivera Committee confirmed that the shortage of capital is a principal problem facing minorities seeking ownership
opportunities and further found that this shortage was due to minority inexperience in obtaining financial institution
misconceptions about potential minority borrowers, and marketplace structural problems, such as high interest
rates and low broadcast industry earnings growth. Among other things, the Rivera Committee suggested educational
and outreach programs and expanding the tax certificate program to nonbroadcast properties such as common carrier
and land mobile. In response to this recommendation, the FCC submitted draft legislation to Congress proposing to
broaden the scope of the Commission's authority to issue tax certificates in connection with the sale or exchange
of any type of telecommunications facilities.
<FOOTCITE>80</FOOTCITE>
 On March 24, 1983, The Minority Telecommunications Ownership Tax Act of 1983, H.R. 2331, which incorporated the Commission's
proposals, was introduced in the House of Representatives.

106. Congress also took steps to address the problem of minority underrepresentation in communications. In 1982,
it mandated the grant of a ``significant preference'' to minority applicants participating in lotteries for spectrum-based
services. 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(i)(3)(A). And, in 1988 and each fiscal year thereafter, Congress attached a provision
to the FCC appropriations legislation, which precluded the Commission from spending any appropriated funds to examine
or change its minority broadcast preference policies.

107. These efforts have met with limited success. The record shows that women and minorities have not gained substantial
ownership representation in either the broadcast or non-broadcast telecommunications industries. For example,
a 1993 report conducted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's (NTIA) Minority Telecommunications
Development Program shows that, as of August 1993, only 2.7 percent of commercial broadcast stations were owned by
minorities. Another study commissioned by the Commerce Department's Minority Business Development Agency in 1991
found that only one half of one percent of the telecommunications firms in the country were minority owned. The study
also identified only 15 minority cable operators and 11 minority firms engaged in the delivery of cellular, specialized
mobile radio, radio paging or messaging services in the United States.
<FOOTCITE>83</FOOTCITE>
 And, according to the last available U.S. Census, only 24 percent of the communications firms in the country were owned
by women, and these women-owned firms generated only approximately 8.7 percent of the revenues earned by communications
companies.
<FOOTCITE>84</FOOTCITE>
 When companies without paid employees are removed from the equation, firms with women owners represent only 14.5
percent of the communications companies in the country.
<FOOTCITE>85</FOOTCITE>
 One result of these low numbers is that there are very few minority or women-owned businesses that bring experience
or infrastructure to PCS. They thus face an additional barrier relative to many existing service providers.

109. Congress directed the Commission to ensure that, together with other designated entities, rural telephone
companies have the opportunity to participate in the provision of PCS. Rural areas, because of their more dispersed
populations, tend to be less profitable to serve than more densely populated urban areas. Therefore, service to these
areas may not be a priority for many PCS licensees. Rural telephone companies, however, are well positioned because
of their existing infrastructure to serve these areas profitably. We, therefore, have adopted special provisions
to encourage their participation, increasing the likelihood of rapid introduction of service to rural areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
110. In the new auction law, Congress directed the Commission to remedy this serious imbalance in the participation
by certain groups, especially minorities and women. The record indicates that, in the absence of meaningful efforts
to assist designated entities, there would be good reason to think that participation by these groups, particularly
businesses owned by women and minorities, would continue to be severely limited. Indeed, the auction law itself envisions
a process that requires payment of funds to acquire an initial license, unlike existing licensing methods such as
comparative hearings or lotteries. It is therefore possible that participation by those with limited access to capital
could be further diminished by operation of the statute, absent affirmative provisions to create competitive opportunity
for designated entities. The measures we adopt in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
thus will carry out Congress's directive to provide meaningful opportunities for small entities, rural telephone
companies, and businesses owned by women and minorities to provide broadband PCS services. The rules also are expressly
designed to address the funding problems that face these groups and that are their principal barriers to entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
111. We also intend that designated entities who win licenses have the opportunity to become strong competitors in
this service. While the new broadband PCS service presents tremendous opportunities for designated entities to
participate in the provision of the next generation of innovative wireless mobile telecommunications services,
it is expected to be a highly competitive service, and the estimated costs of acquiring a license and constructing
facilities are substantial. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which was adopted June 9, 1994, we took specific steps to assist designated entities to become viable competitors
in the provision of broadband PCS. For example, we modified the PCS spectrum allocation plan by shifting all channels
blocks to a contiguous lower segment of the ``emerging technologies band'' in part to bolster the ability of designated
entities to obtain more competitively viable licenses. In addition, we relaxed some of the ownership and attribution
rules with respect to cellular operators' participation in PCS to foster investment in designated entity ventures,
<FOOTCITE>87</FOOTCITE>
 and we also relaxed the PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule for designated entities with cellular holdings to allow
them to further expand their opportunities in broadband PCS.
<FOOTCITE>88</FOOTCITE>
 Further, we took steps that will result in lower capital costs for designated entities that obtain PCS licenses, including
adoption of a band plan that will reduce the costs of clearing the PCS spectrum of incumbent microwave users as well
as relaxing the construction requirements.

businesses, small businesses, and businesses owned by women and minorities to raise capital by attracting passive
equity investors. At the same time, we have designed these rules to ensure that the special provisions adopted for
such businesses accrue to the intended beneficiaries.

113. As discussed more fully below, many commenters in this proceeding believe that the inability of designated entities
to obtain adequate funding has a profoundly adverse effect on the potential for these businesses to bid successfully
in auctions against very large, established businesses. Therefore, we take a number of steps in this Order to help
address this imbalance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We establish two ``entrepreneurs' blocks'' (frequency blocks C and F) in which large companies (those with
$125 million or more in annual gross revenues or $500 million or more in total assets) will be prohibited from bidding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Bidding credits will be granted both to small businesses and to businesses owned by women and minorities in
the entrepreneurs' blocks to provide them with a better opportunity to compete successfully in broadband PCS auctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Certain winning bidders in frequency blocks C and F will be permitted to pay the license price in installments,
and the interest rate and moratorium on principal payments will be adjusted to assist small businesses and women and
minority-owned businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We adopt a tax certificate program for minority and women-owned businesses, which will provide additional
assistance in their efforts to attract equity investors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Rural telephone companies will be allowed to obtain broadband PCS licenses that are geographically partitioned
from larger PCS service areas to provide them more flexibility to serve rural subscribers.

In a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making in this docket, we will seek comment on whether a partitioning option for
small businesses or businesses owned by women or minorities, as suggested by some of the commenters, may be appropriate.
In that Further Notice, we also will seek comment or whether the Commission should impose a restriction on the assignment
or transfer of control of partitioned licenses by rural telephone companies or other designated entities for some

The gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth of certain investors are not considered so long as the applicant
has a `'control group'' consisting of one or more individuals or entities that control the applicant, hold at least
25 percent of the equity and, for corporations, at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.

117. We also have imposed numerous strict requirements to deter shams and fronts and to prevent abuse of the incentives
for designated entities. The Commission intends to enforce vigorously each of these requirements. All licensees
in the entrepreneurs' blocks are prohibited from voluntarily assigning or transferring their licenses for three
years after grant of the application and for the next two years may assign or transfer licenses only to other entities
that satisfy the financial criteria to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Furthermore, a business that seeks to acquire
a license from an entity paying in installments during the license period will be required, as a condition of the grant,
to pay according to the installment payment terms for which it qualifies, unless they are more favorable in which case
the existing terms apply. If the purchaser is not qualified for any installment payment plan, we will require payment
of the unpaid balance in full before the sale will be approved. We also adopt rules to ensure that the value of the bidding
credit is returned to the government in the event of a transfer of control or assignment of the license to an entity not
qualifying for bidding credits or not qualifying for as high a bidding credit as the seller. In addition, we impose
a one-year holding period on licenses received through the benefit of a tax certificate. We will also random audits
to ensure that designated entities

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 control. These steps and our eligibility and affiliation rules will help to ensure that the measures we adopt are utilized

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eligible entities and to deter winning bidders seeking only to make a quick profit on the sale of PCS licenses. Ultimately,
we believe that we will best fulfill our statutory mandate by creating powerful incentives for

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

of service, and be requiring a strict holding period to ensure that the public receives the benefit of this diverse
ownership.

118. As discussed above, because the auction process itself requires additional expenditures of capital to acquire
licenses, this new licensing procedure in many respects holds the potential to erect an additional barrier to entry
that had not existed even under the Act's previous licensing methods, comparative hearings and lotteries. As reflected
in the House Committee Report, Congress was well aware of that possibility and wanted to ensure that competitive bidding
should not exclude smaller entities from obtaining licenses.
<FOOTCITE>91</FOOTCITE>
 The inability of small businesses and businesses owned by women and minorities to obtain adequate private financing
creates a serious imbalance between these companies and large businesses in their prospects for competing successfully
in broadband PCS auctions.

119. In addition, commenters contend that, at the outset, a small PCS business and a large local exchange carrier would
value a license very differently. DCR Communications, for example, argues that a local telephone company would have
much lower costs of construction and operation through equipment volume discounts, existing billing, accounting,
order entry and processing, and customer service systems. Furthermore, DCR contends, the telephone company might
decide to use its PCS system simply as an adjunct to a cellular system it owns in a nearby market and market wireless handsets
that operate in both frequencies. DCR concludes that the telephone company could justify paying the higher value
for the license because it has more ready access to capital.

120. This concern is echoed by a number of commenters. NTIA agrees that capital formation is a major barrier to full
participation by small and minority-owned firms, asserting that capital-constrained firms are likely to assign
lower values to PCS licenses than other bidders and are therefore less likely to obtain licenses in an open bidding
market.
<FOOTCITE>93</FOOTCITE>
 Another party, Impulse Telecommunications Corporation, states that ``giants'' can justify huge bids because they
have billions of dollars of capital as well as an existing administrative, billing, operating and marketing infrastructure.
In addition, Impulse asserts that PCS licenses are likely to hold strategic value for large long distance and local
telephone companies, for such purposes as critical wireless access.
<FOOTCITE>94</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, Tri-State Radio Company states that the allocation of substantial amounts of spectrum to services such
as broadband PCS has generated extensive industry expectation and speculation. With the financial stakes so high,
Tri-State argues that designated entities will have little ability to bid successfully against ``communications
behemoths with almost unlimited financial resources.''

121. We agree that small entities stand little chance of acquiring licenses in these broadband auctions if required
to bid against existing large companies, particularly large telephone, cellular and cable television companies.
If one or more of these big firms targets a market for strategic reasons, there is almost no likelihood that it could
be outbid by a small business. In the Notice, we proposed that one means to address such problems would be to set aside
specific spectrum blocks in broadband PCS that would be reserved for bidding purposes to the designated entities.
<FOOTCITE>96</FOOTCITE>
 In this Order, we have decided to adopt a modification of this proposal, which should greatly enhance the ability of
all designated entities to enter auctions and bid successfully for broadband PCS licenses. Specifically, we establish
two entrepreneurs' blocks, C and F, in which eligibility to bid is limited to entities that, together with their affiliates
and certain investors, have gross revenues of less than $125 million in each of the last two years and total assets of
less than $500 million. In addition, we will prohibit an applicant from bidding in these blocks if any one individual
investor in the applicant has $100 million or greater in personal net worth. Together with a reduced upfront payment
requirement, we believe this proposal will encourage smaller entities to enter the auctions for broadband PCS licenses
and will ensure that ``entrepreneurial'' businesses are granted nearly half of all the broadband PCS licenses being
auctioned.

122. NTIA strongly supports this measure, arguing that it ``would be the most direct mechanism for preserving opportunities
for small companies in an auction environment.'' According to NTIA, reserving two entrepreneurs' blocks helps significantly
in satisfying the congressional directive that competitive bidding not result in an increase in concentration in
the telecommunications industries.
<FOOTCITE>97</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, Columbia PCS contends that establishment of entrepreneurs' blocks ``provides a good balance between
Congress's clear mandate to provide opportunities for designated entities and avoid undue concentration of PCS
licenses on the one hand with the goal of capturing the value of allocated spectrum for the American public on the other.''

123. The $125 million gross revenue/$500 million asset caps have the effect of excluding the large companies that
would easily be able to outbid designated entities and frustrate Congress's goal of disseminating licenses among
a diversity of licensees. At the same time, this restriction does not exclude many firms that, while not large in comparison
with other telecommunications companies, nevertheless are likely to have the financial ability to provide sustained
competition for the PCS licensees on the MTA blocks. For example, the $125 million gross revenue figure corresponds
roughly to the Commission's definition of a Tier 2, or medium-sized, local exchange carrier,
<FOOTCITE>99</FOOTCITE>
 and would include virtually all of the independently owned rural telephone companies. Limiting the personal net
worth of any individual investor or affiliate of the applicant to $100 million will prevent a very wealthy individual
from leveraging his or her personal assets to allow the applicant to circumvent the size limitations of the entrepreneurs'
blocks.

Local exchange carriers are categorized as Tier 1 and Tier 2 companies by applying the criterion that Sections 32.11(a)
and 32.11(e) of the Commission's Rules use to distinguish Class A and Class B companies, respectively. Class A companies
are those companies having annual revenues from regulated telecommunications operations of $100 million or more;
Class B companies are those companies having annual revenues from regulated telecommunications operations of less
than $100 million. The initial classification of a company is determined by its lowest annual operating revenues
for the five immediately preceding years. A company's classification is changed when its annual operating revenue
exceeds or is under the $100 million mark in each of five consecutive years. The Commission imposes more relaxed regulatory
requirements on Tier 2 LECs than on Tier 1 LECs.

124. As noted previously, many commenters asked us to reserve spectrum blocks for bidding only by designated entities.
The entrepreneurs' blocks plan adopted herein is similar in concept to the set-aside proposals set forth by the commenters.
Therefore, in determining which of the blocks in each market should constitute the entrepreneurs' blocks, we paid
close attention to the concerns of those who had advocated set-asides in the first instance. Although the broadband
PCS band plan has changed since the Commission first proposed set-asides in the Notice and parties first submitted
their proposals in this docket, the general concerns of these parties about the amount of spectrum and geographic
territory necessary to compete effectively remain pertinent. Moreover, we adopted the revised broadband PCS band
plan in advance of this Order, which afforded interested parties the opportunity to make additional presentations
on designated entity incentives in light of the new band plan.

The Small Business PCS Association asserted, moreover, that implementation of the set-aside proposal would offer
``a major opportunity'' for small businesses, that a 20 MHz block is ``probably ideal'' for development by small entrepreneurs,
and that even a 10 MHz block could sustain a viable PCS System.

The Small Business PCS Association stated that a small business operating in a single BTA service region could effectively
compete with large companies operating in larger service areas. This is so, it contended, mainly because PCS providers
with large service areas would not realize such great economies of scale as many have supposed and because small firms
could counter such advantages by forming buying cooperatives. Comments of Small Business PCS Association at 2&hyph;3.

126. A considerable number of commenters, however, contended that the Commission's proposal to set aside a 20 MHz
block and a 10 MHz block would be inadequate. Telephone Electronics and AWCC asserted, for instance, that a provider
operating with only a 10 MHz or 20 MHz license could not offer a full range of PCS services with quality equivalent to
the like offerings of a provider operating with a 20 MHz license. Unique and AWCC thus argued that PCS licensees in the
set-aside spectrum would consequently be unable to obtain commercial funding on terms as favorable to those available
to operators with 30 MHz licenses. Independent Cellular Network maintained that the competitive disadvantages
of the proposed set-aside channels, due to their lesser bandwidth, could not be obviated through aggregation, because
of the greater transaction costs that would be incurred above those associated with acquisition of a single 30 MHz
license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
127. We believe that designating frequency blocks C and F as entrepreneurs' blocks meets the concerns of most of the
designated entity commenters. Frequency block C provides 30 MHz of spectrum and, thus, satisfies the concerns of
those parties who believe they must have this amount of bandwidth to compete effectively. The MHz block F license,
on the other hand, fulfills the needs of other designated entities who argued in favor of small blocks. Moreover, since
the C and F blocks are adjacent, they can be aggregated efficiently by one or more licensees. This plan also makes available
to eligible bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks 986 licenses, or slightly under 50 percent of all broadband PCS licenses.
Finally, it does not foreclose opportunities for other parties. Bidders ineligible for the entrepreneurs' blocks
will have the opportunity to bid on 99 30 MHz MTA licenses throughout the country, as well as 986 10 MHz BTA licenses nationwide.

Five-Year Holding and Limited Transfer Period

. In establishing the entrepreneurs' blocks, we recognize the congressionally mandated objective will not be served
if parties take advantage of bidding in these blocks and immediately assign or transfer control of the authorizations
to other entities. Such a practice could unjustly enrich the auction winners and would undermine the congressional
goal of giving designated entities the opportunity to provide spectrum-based services. Therefore, we will prohibit
licensees in the entrepreneurs' blocks from voluntarily assigning or transferring control of their licenses for
a period of three years from the date of the license grant.
<FOOTCITE>101</FOOTCITE>
 And, for the next two years of the license term, we will permit the licensee to assign or transfer control of its authorization
only to an entity that satisfies the entrepreneurs' blocks entry criteria.
<FOOTCITE>102</FOOTCITE>
 During this five-year period, licensees will continue to be bound by the financial eligibility requirements, as
set forth below.

129. Our goals are to create significant opportunities for entrepreneurs, small businesses, and businesses owned
by minorities and women to compete in auctions for licenses and attract sufficient capital to build-out those licenses
and provide service. We recognize the critical need to attract capital, which requires flexibility. We are very concerned,
however, that such flexibility not undermine our more fundamental objective, which is to ensure that designated
entities retain

 control of their companies at all times. We believe that the five-year holding and limited transfer period, which

longer holding period (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

130. In the Notice, we indicated that we might use spectrum set-asides for designated entities in the broadband PCS
service but did not expressly propose to use bidding credits. For two other services, IVDS and narrowband PCS, however,
we did conclude recently that the use of bidding credits in auctions would be an effective tool to ensure that women
and minority-owned businesses have opportunities to participate in the provision of those services.
<FOOTCITE>105</FOOTCITE>
 On further reflection, and based on the many comments in the record favoring this approach, we believe that bidding
credits are necessary to ensure that women and minority-owned businesses and small businesses participate in broadband
PCS. Accordingly, we adopt a bidding credit plan for winning bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks that gives small
businesses a 10 percent credit, women and minority-owned businesses a 15 percent credit, and small businesses owned
by women and minorities an aggregate credit of 25 percent.

131. At the outset, we note that we are confining the bidding credit option to the entrepreneurs' blocks because, given
the extremely capital intensive nature of broadband PCS, we do not think bidding credits in an uninsulated block would
have a meaningful effect.
<FOOTCITE>106</FOOTCITE>
 Indeed, in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 presentations to the Commission, many commenters have indicated that, without spectrum set-asides for broadband
PCS, bidding credits would not be sufficient to assist designated entities in outbidding very large entities who
are likely to bid for licenses in this service. DCR Communications states, for example, that all of the existing large
telecommunications carriers can justify must larger payments for licenses than could an individual entrepreneur,
regardless of a bidder's credit. Therefore, it believes no entrepreneur will win a bid for any PCS market that is desirable
to any of the large companies.
<FOOTCITE>107</FOOTCITE>
 Many other commenters echo this concern.
<FOOTCITE>108</FOOTCITE>
 Some state that, if bidding credits alone are used, extraordinarily large credits, even on the order of 50 percent
or more, would be ineffective.
<FOOTCITE>109</FOOTCITE>
 As described above, in order to afford designated entities a realistic opportunity to obtain licenses in the broadband
PCS service, we have taken measures to exclude very large businesses from bidding for licenses in the C and F blocks.
These measures will enhance the value of the bidding credits for small businesses and businesses owned by minorities
and women. In this context, we believe that bidding credits will have a significant effect on the ability of small businesses
and businesses owned by women and minorities to participate successfully in auctions for licenses in these blocks.

132. As explained above, the capital access problems faced by small firms and women and minority-owned firms make
special provisions like bidding credits appropriate for these designated entities in broadband PCS.
<FOOTCITE>110</FOOTCITE>
 In effect, the bidding credit will function as a discount on the bid price a firm will actually have to pay to obtain a
license and, thus, will address directly the financing obstacles encountered by these entities. Moreover, as noted
previously, women and minorities face discrimination in lending and other barriers to entry not encountered by other
firms, including other designated entities. Therefore, as one of the measures designed to counter these increased
capital formation difficulties, we will provide them with a slightly higher bidding credit than that granted to small
businesses. Thus, women and minorities will receive a 15 percent payment discount that is applied against the amounts
they bid on licenses. Absent such measures targeted specifically to women and minorities, it would be virtually impossible
to assure that these groups achieve any meaningful measure of opportunity for actual participation in the provision
of broadband PCS. Similarly, it is reasonable to assume that small firms owned by women and minorities suffer the problems
endemic to both groups and that a cumulative bidding credit of 25 percent is therefore appropriate. We believe that
these measures will help women and minorities to attract the capital necessary for obtaining a license and constructing
and operating a broadband PCS system, consistent with the intent of Congress.

Although we did not grant bidding credits to small businesses in the narrowband PCS or IVDS services, we believe that,
given the exponentially greater expense likely to be incurred in acquiring broadband PCS licenses and construct
the systems, bidding credits are a proper means to ensure that these firms have the opportunity to participate in this
service. We note that for narrowband PCS and IVDS, the cost of license acquisition and implementation of service is
anticipated to be considerably more modest.

133. The definition of a minority or women-owned firm and of a small business are set forth below.
<FOOTCITE>111</FOOTCITE>
 To receive a 10 percent bidding credit, a small business must satisfy a gross revenue test. As explained more fully
below in the small business definition section, a consortium consisting entirely of small businesses also is eligible
for a 10 percent bidding credit even if the combined gross revenues of the consortium exceed the small business gross
revenues threshold. In addition, a small business that is owned by women and minorities must satisfy the definition
of a business owned by minorities and women as well as the small business definition to receive a 25 percent bidding
credit. Finally, a consortium of small firms owned by women and/or minorities is eligible for a 25 percent bidding
credit, provided that each member of the consortium meets the definition of a small business and a minority and/or
women-owned firm.

Unjust Enrichment Applicable to Bidding Credits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To ensure that bidding credits benefit the parties to whom they are directed, we adopt strict repayment penalties.
If, within the original term, a licensee applies to assign or transfer control of a license to an entity that is not eligible
for as a high a level of bidding credit, then the difference between the bidding credit obtained by the assigning party
and the bidding credit for which the acquiring party would qualify must be paid to the U.S. Treasury as a condition of
approval of the transfer. For example, an assignment of a license from a small minority-owned firm to a women-owned
firm with revenues greater than $40 million would require repayment of 10 percent of the original bid price (25 percent
less 15 percent) to the Treasury. A sale to an entity that would not qualify for bidding credits will entail full payment
of the bidding credit as a condition of transfer. Small businesses also will be bound by the financial eligibility
rules during the entire license term as set forth below. Thus, if after licensing an investor purchases an ``attributable''
interest in the business and, as a result, the gross revenues of the firm exceed the $40 million small business cap,
this repayment provision will apply.
<FOOTCITE>112</FOOTCITE>
 These repayment provisions apply throughout the original term of the license to help promote the long-term holding
of licenses by those parties receiving bidding credits.

135. A significant barrier for most businesses small enough to qualify to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks will be
access to adequate private financing to ensure their ability to compete against larger firms in the PCS marketplace.

 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we concluded that installment payments are an effective means to address the inability of small businesses to obtain
financing and will enable these entities to compete more effectively for the auctioned spectrum. We also determined
that small businesses eligible for installment payments would only be required to pay half of the down payment (10
percent of the winning bid, as opposed to 20 percent) five days after the auction closes, with the remaining 10 percent
payment deferred until five days after grant of the license. Finally, we indicated that installment payments should
be made available to small businesses at an interest rate equal to the rate for U.S. Treasury obligations.

136. In light of the expected substantial capital required to acquire and construct broadband PCS licenses, we conclude
that installment payments are an appropriate measure for most businesses that obtain broadband PCS licenses in the
entrepreneurs' blocks. By allowing payment in installments, the government is in effect extending credit to licensees,
thus reducing the amount of private financing needed prior to and after the auction. Such low cost government financing
will promote long-term participation by these businesses, which, because of their smaller size, lack access to sufficient
capital to compete effectively with larger PCS licensees. Under the rules we adopt today, installment payments are
available to small entities that do not technically qualify as small businesses for purposes of other measures we
have adopted, such as bidding credits. We believe, however, that, given the enormous costs of broadband PCS and the
likelihood of very large participants in the other blocks, this option is fully consistent with the congressional
intent in enacting Section 309(j)(4)(A) to avoid a competitive bidding program that has the effect of favoring incumbent
providers of other communications services, with established revenue streams, over smaller entities.

137. Under the plan we adopt here, all licensees that satisfy the gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth
criteria to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks will be allowed to pay in installments for licenses granted in those blocks
in the 50 largest BTAs. In the smaller BTAs, however, only businesses owned by women and minorities and those licensees
with less than $75 million in gross revenues will be able to use installment payments.
<FOOTCITE>115</FOOTCITE>
 This distinction is based on the expected lower costs to acquire licenses and construct systems in the smaller BTAs.
Thus, with the exception of companies owned by women or minorities, which face additional problems accessing capital,
we do not think that a firm with gross revenues exceeding $75 million will require government financing to be competitive
in the small BTAs.

We will apply the same $500 million total assets and $100 million personal net worth standards for purposes of determining

138. The installment payment option will enable qualified businesses to pay their winning bid over time. These businesses
must make the applicable upfront payment in full before the auction, but are required to make a post-auction down payment
equaling only ten percent of their winning bids, half of which will be due five business days after the auction closes.
Payment of the other half of the down payment will be deferred until five business days after the license is granted.
In general, the remaining 90 percent of the auction price will be paid in installments with interest charges to be fixed
at the time of licensing at a rate equal to the rate for ten-year U.S. Treasury obligations plus 2.5 percent. Under this
general rule, only payments of interest will be due for the first year with principal and interest payments amortized
over the remaining nine years of the license. Timely payment of all installments will be a condition of the license
grant and failure to make sure timely payment will be grounds for revocation of the license.

Enhanced Installment Payments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As explained previously, small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women face capital access difficulties
not encountered by other firms and, thus, require special measures to ensure their opportunity to participate in
broadband PCS. Accordingly, we will provide an ``enhanced'' installment payment plan for these entities. Pursuant
to this enhanced installment payment plan, small businesses (as defined below) who win licenses in the entrepreneurs'
blocks will be required to pay interest only for the first two years of the license term at the same interest rate as set
forth in the general rule. Businesses owned by women and/or minorities will be able to make interest-only payments
for three years. Interest will accrue at the Treasury note rate without the additional 2.5 percent.
<FOOTCITE>118</FOOTCITE>
 And, finally, businesses that are both small and owned by women and/or minorities will be required to pay only interest
for five years. Interest will accrue at the Treasury note rate.

To be eligible for these ``enhanced'' installment payments, a firm must satisfy either of the two alternative definitions
of a woman or minority-owned business, as set forth in &para;&para; 181&hyph;192, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

140. These enhanced installment payments are narrowly tailored to the needs of the various designated entities,
as reflected in the record in this proceeding. We believe that varying the moratorium on principal in the early years
of the loan and varying the interest rate based on these needs will allow small businesses and companies owned by women
and/or minorities to bid higher in auctions, thereby increasing their changes for obtaining licenses. In addition,
it will allow them to concentrate their resources on infrastructure build-out and, therefore, it will increase the
likelihood that they become viable PCS competitors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unjust Enrichment Applicable to Installment Payments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. To ensure that large businesses do not become the unintended beneficiaries of measures meant for smaller firms,
we will use the unjust enrichment provisions adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 applicable to installment payments. Specifically, if a licensee that was awarded installment payments seeks to
assign or transfer control of its license to an entity not meeting the applicable eligibility standards set out above
during the term of the license, we will require payment of the remaining principal and any interest accrued through
the date of assignment as a condition of the license assignment or transfer. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &para; 263; 47 CFR 1.2111(c). Moreover, if an entity seeks to assign or transfer control of a license to an entity
that does not qualify for as favorable an installment payment plan, the installment payment plan, if any, for which
the acquiring entity qualifies will become effective immediately upon transfer. Thus, a higher interest rate and
earlier payment of principal may begin to be applied. For example, a transfer of a license in the fourth year after license
grant from a small minority-owned firm to a small non-minority owned firm would require that the firm begin principal
payments and the balance would begin accruing interest at a rate 2.5 percent above the rate that had been in effect.
<FOOTCITE>119</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, if an investor subsequently purchases an ``attributable'' interest in the businesses and, as a result,
the gross revenues or total assets of the business exceed the applicable financial caps, this unjust enrichment provision
will also apply.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
We recognize that because of the five-year holding and limited transfer requirements in the entrepreneurs' blocks,
these unjust enrichment provisions have limited applicability during the first five years of the license term. Nevertheless,
there are some situations in which licensees are permitted to assign or transfer their licenses during this period
and the provisions would then apply if the buyer would not have been qualified for installment payments or as favorable
an installment payment plan. Furthermore, the unjust enrichment provisions are applicable for the full ten-year
license term.

G. Tax Certificates

142. Congress instructed the Commission to consider the use of tax certificates to help ensure designated entity
participation in spectrum-based services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we observed that tax certificates could be useful as a means of attracting investors to designated entity enterprises
and to encourage licensees to assign or transfer control of licenses to designated entities in post-auction transactions.
We stated further that we would examine the feasibility of using this measure in subsequent service-specific auction
rules.

143. We believe that tax certificates, which allow the recipients to defer capital gains taxes made on sales, are an
appropriate tool to assist women and minority-owned businesses to attract start-up capital from non-controlling
investors in broadband PCS. As explained above, due to discrimination in private lending markets and other factors,
these designated entities face added obstacles in accessing capital. Therefore, in order to ensure that such businesses
have a meaningful opportunity to participate in auctions, it is necessary to adopt measures to encourage investment
in minority and woman-owned companies. Moreover, because of the severe underrepresentation of women and minorities
in telecommunications, we believe that it is appropriate to give PCS licensees the incentive, through the grant of
tax certificates, to assign or transfer their authorizations to such entities in post-auction sales. This measure
will provide added assurance that minority and women-owned entities have the opportunity to participate in broadband
PCS services, as mandated by Congress. Accordingly, we will issue tax certificates to non-controlling initial investors
in minority and women-owned broadband PCS applicants (in any frequency block), upon the sale of their non-controlling
interests. We will also issue tax certificates to broadband PCS licensees (in any frequency block) who assign or transfer
control of their licenses to minority and women-owned entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
144. We have used tax certificates over the years to encourage broadcast licensees and cable television operators
to transfer their stations and systems to minority buyers.
<FOOTCITE>121</FOOTCITE>
 We also have granted tax certificates to shareholders in minority-controlled broadcast or cable entities who sell
their shares, when such interests were acquired to assist in the financing of the acquisition of the facility.
<FOOTCITE>122</FOOTCITE>
 These broadcast and cable tax certificates are issued pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. &sect;1071.
While Congress' goal in authorizing tax certificates under Section 309(j)(4)(D) of the Act is somewhat different,
and focuses on ensuring the opportunity for designated entities to participate in auctions and spectrum-based services,
we think that tax certificates will be equally valuable in the broadband PCS context. Issuance of tax certificates
to investors in minority and women-owned businesses and licensees that sell to minorities and women will augment
the other measures we adopt today to encourage minorities and women to participate in broadband PCS and will increase
the ability of these entities to access financing for that purpose.

145. In implementing this program, we will borrow from our existing tax certificate program and grant tax certificates,
upon request, that will enable the licensees and investors meeting the criteria outlined here to defer the gain realized
upon a sale by: (1) Treating it as an involuntary conversion under 26 U.S.C. &sect;1033, with the recognition of gain
avoided by the acquisition of qualified replacement property; or (2) electing to reduce the basis of certain depreciable
property; or both. Tax certificates will be available to initial investors in minority and woman-owned businesses
who provide ``start-up'' financing, which allows these businesses to acquire licenses at auction or in the post-auction
market, and those investors who purchase interests within the first year after license issuance, which allows for
the stabilization of the designated entities' capital base. The definition of a minority or women-owned entity is
set forth below
<FOOTCITE>123</FOOTCITE>
 and, with regard to our investor tax certificate policy, the entity in which the investment is made must satisfy that
definition at the time of the original investment as well as after the investor's shares are sold. For post-auction
market sales, tax certificates will be issued only to licensees who sell to entities that meet that definition. Tax
certificates will be granted only upon completion of the sale, although parties may request a declaratory ruling
from the Commission regarding the tax certificate consequences of prospective transactions.

One-Year Holding Period
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As with our other tax certificate policies, we are concerned about avoiding ``sham'' arrangements to obtain tax
certificates and, pursuant to Section 309(j)(4)(E), thus adopt measures to prevent abuses. As in our existing tax
certificate program,
<FOOTCITE>124</FOOTCITE>
 we will impose a one-year holding requirement on the transfer of control or assignment of broadband PCS licenses by
women and minority-owned businesses who obtained such licenses through the benefit of tax certificates. We believe
that the rapid resale of such licenses at a profit would subvert our goal of ensuring the opportunity to participate
by minority or woman-owned businesses. If the buyer itself is a women or minority-owned business, however, our objectives
still will be satisfied. Thus, as an exception to the holding requirement, we will permit the assignment or transfer
of control of licenses during this period to other qualified minority and women-owned businesses. We note, however,
that the assignee or transferee who receives this license before the end of the original one-year holding period will
also be subject to a one-year holding requirement, from the date of consummation of the assignment or transfer.

, we indicated that we would address in this proceeding proposals for issuing tax certificates to cellular operators
who divest their cellular holdings in order to come into compliance with our rules governing cellular operators'
participation in broadband PCS. Several commenters argued that tax certificates should be issued to all such companies
who divest their holdings.
<FOOTCITE>125</FOOTCITE>
 To accomplish the directive in Section 309(j)(4)(D) that minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate
in the provision of spectrum-based services, we have decided to issue tax certificates to such cellular companies
so long as their cellular interests are divested to businesses owned by minorities and/or women, as defined in this
order. In this manner, we can further implement Congress's goal to facilitate the participation of minorities and
women in spectrum-based services. We will also impose a one-year holding period requirement on the assignment or
transfer of control of cellular licenses obtained by women and minority-owned businesses through the benefit of
this tax certificate policy.

at &para;125. This action increases the number of rural telephone companies that will be eligible to hold PCS licenses.
In taking this action, we recognized that their existing infrastructure makes rural telephone companies well suited
to introduce PCS services rapidly into their service areas and adjacent areas. Thus, this action will help speed service
to rural areas, which tend to be less profitable to serve for companies without existing infrastructure than more
densely populated urban areas.

150. We suggested in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that allowing broadband PCS licenses to be geographically partitioned may be a means to permit rural telephone companies
to hold licenses to provide service in their telephone service areas.
<FOOTCITE>126</FOOTCITE>
 Many rural telephone companies proposed some form of partitioning in their comments, arguing that if they were required
to bid on entire BTA or MTA licenses to obtain licenses covering their wireline service areas, they would be effectively
barred from entering the broadband PCS industry. They contend that under a partitioning plan, they would be able to
serve areas in which they already provide service, while the remainder of the PCS service area could be served by other
providers. Such a plan, they argue, would encourage rural telephone companies to take advantage of existing infrastructure
in providing PCS services, thereby speeding service to rural areas.
<FOOTCITE>127</FOOTCITE>
 We believe that these proposals have merit, and therefore we now adopt a license partitioning system to provide these
designated entities the enhanced opportunity to participate in the provision of broadband PCS and to deploy broadband
PCS in their rural services areas rapidly.

151. Our partitioning system will allow rural telephone companies to obtain broadband PCS licenses that are geographically
partitioned from larger PCS service areas. These companies will be permitted to acquire partitioned broadband PCS
licenses in either of two ways in any frequency blocks: (1) They may form bidding consortia consisting entirely of
rural telephone companies to participate in auctions, and then partition the licenses won among consortia participants,
and (2) they may acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses from other licensees through private negotiation and
agreement either before or after the auction. Each rural telephone company member of a consortium will, following
the auction, be required to file a long-form application for its respective, mutually agreed-upon geographic area.
If rural telephone company consortia are formed to bid on licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks, the eligibility
rules for those blocks will apply (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the cumulative gross revenues and assets of the consortium members may not exceed the financial caps for eligibility
in these blocks).
<FOOTCITE>128</FOOTCITE>
 We will require that partitioned areas conform to established geopolitical boundaries (such as county lines) and
that each area include all portions of the wireline service area of the rural telephone company applicant that lies
within the PCS service area. In addition, if a rural telephone company receives a partitioned license post-auction
from another PCS licensee, the partitioned area must be reasonably related to the rural telephone company's wireline
service area that lies within the PCS service area.
<FOOTCITE>129</FOOTCITE>
 We recognize that rural telephone companies will require some flexibility in fashioning the areas in which they will
receive partitioned licenses, so we do not adopt a strict rule concerning the reasonableness of the partitioned area.
Generally, we will presume as reasonable a partitioned area that contains no more than twice the population of that
portion of a rural telephone company's wireline service area that lies within the PCS service area. Each licensee
in each partitioned area will be responsible for meeting the build-out requirements in its area.

&para;&para;179&hyph;180. Therefore, if each member of a consortium of rural telephone companies also satisfies
the definition of a small business, we will allow the consortium to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks even if it exceeds
the gross revenues and total assets caps.

152. Allowing partitioning of rural areas served by rural telephone companies provides a viable opportunity for
many of these designated entities who desire to offer PCS to their customers as a complement to their local telephone
services. For example, rural telephone companies who cannot afford or do not desire to bid for or construct PCS systems
for an entire BTA can thus acquire licenses in areas they wish to serve or form bidding consortia and partition the entire
BTA among themselves. We believe that rural partitioning is an efficient method of getting a license in the hands of
an entity that will provide rapid service to rural areas.

153. We have decided not to adopt any other auction-related measures specifically for rural telephone companies
in this Order. We believe that the partitioning plan we are adopting will provide rural telephone companies with substantial
capabilities to acquire licenses to provide broadband PCS in their rural telephone service areas, consistent with
our statutory mandate. In addition, our eligibility criteria for bidding in the entrepreneurs' blocks, discussed
below, will permit virtually all telephone companies whose service areas are predominantly rural to bid on licenses
in frequency blocks C and F without competition from the large telephone companies and other deep-pocketed bidders.
Thus, virtually all rural telephone companies will be able to bid for broadband PCS licenses and defer payment in accordance
with the installment payment plans we are adopting for the entrepreneurs' blocks. We also note that if a rural telephone
company meets the definition of a small business or a business owned by minorities and/or women, it would enjoy a bidding
credit and ``enhanced'' installment payments applicable to those groups when bidding on licenses in these blocks.
We do not think that any other measures are necessary in order to satisfy the statute's directive that we ensure that
rural telephone companies have the opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services, and
to satisfy our goals to ensure that PCS is provided to all areas of the country including rural areas.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
154. Upfront payment requirements are designed to ensure that bidders are qualified and serious and to provide the
Commission with a source of funds in the event that it becomes necessary to assess default or bid withdrawal penalties.
<FOOTCITE>130</FOOTCITE>
 The upfront payment ensures that bids during the course of the auction are

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and convey information about the value of the underlying licenses. Our standard upfront payment for broadband PCS
is $0.02 per MHz per pop, which is equivalent to roughly six percent of the license value, based on an estimate in a Congressional
Budget Office report of the total value of the auctionable spectrum.
<FOOTCITE>131</FOOTCITE>
 A number of commenters assert that the Commission could enhance the opportunity of designated entities to participate
in competitive bidding by reducing the required upfront payment for those applicants.
<FOOTCITE>132</FOOTCITE>
 We agree that the $0.02 per MHz per pop upfront payment requirement might impose a barrier for smaller entities wishing
to participate in the auctions. Moreover, we note that most bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks will be entitled
to pay for their licenses in installments, which requires a down payment of only five percent of the winning bid. We
are concerned that requiring an upfront payment that may be larger than the down payment that the winning bidder is
required to tender could discourage auction participation.

155. For these reasons, we will reduce the upfront payment requirement to $0.015 per MHz per pop for bidders in the entrepreneurs'
blocks. This 25 percent discount should facilitate auction participation by capital-constrained companies and
permit them to conserve resources for infrastructure development after winning a license. Moreover, since the upfront
payment is still substantial, ranging from slightly below $20,000 for a 30 MHz license in the smallest BTAs to more
than $10 million for the New York BTA, insincere bidding will be discouraged and the Commission will have access to
funds if it must collect default or bid withdrawal penalty payments.

156. As noted previously, eligibility to bid in the two entrepreneurs' blocks, C and F, is limited to companies that,
together with their affiliates and investors, had gross revenues of less than $125 million in each of the last two years
and have total assets of less than $500 million at the time their short form applications are filed. In addition, we
will prohibit an applicant from bidding in these blocks if any one individual investor or principal in the applicant
has $100 million or greater in personal net worth at the short form application filing date.

157. In determining whether an applicant satisfies these financial thresholds, we will count the gross revenues
and total assets of the applicant as well as those of its investors with ``attributable'' interests. The subsection
that follows discusses what interests are attributable for these purposes. In addition, it sets forth exceptions
to these attribution rules for minority and women-owned applicants and for publicly-traded companies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Qualified ``Entrepreneurs''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a general rule, the gross revenues and total assets of all investors in, and affiliates of, an applicant are counted
on a cumulative, fully-diluted basis for purposes of determining whether the $125 million/$500 million thresholds
have been exceeded, and on an individual basis regarding the $100 personal net worth standard.
<FOOTCITE>133</FOOTCITE>
 There are two exceptions to this rule, however. First, applicants that meet the definition of a small business may,
as discussed below, form consortia of small businesses that, on an aggregate basis, exceed the gross revenue/total
asset caps. Second, the gross revenues, total assets, personal net worth, and affiliations of any investor in the
applicant are not considered so long as the investor holds less than 25 percent of the applicant's passive equity.
For corporations, we shall use the term passive equity investors to mean investors who hold only non-voting stock
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 amounts of voting stock that include no more than five percent of the voting interests. Where different classes of
stock are held, however, the total amount of equity must still be less than 25 percent to meet this requirement. For
partnerships, the term means limited partnership interests that do not have the power to exercise control of the entity.
<FOOTCITE>134</FOOTCITE>
 The passive investor exception will be available, however, only so long as the applicant remains under the control
of one or more entities or individuals (defined as the ``control group'') and the control group holds at least 25 percent
of the applicant's equity and, in the case of corporate applicants, at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
<FOOTCITE>135</FOOTCITE>
 In the case of partnership applicants, the control group must hold all the general partnership interests. Winning
bidders are required to identify on their long-form applications the identity of the members of this control group
and the means of ensuring control (such as a voting trust agreement). The gross revenues, total assets and personal
net worth (if applicable) of each member of the control group and each member's affiliates will be counted toward the
$125 million gross revenues/$500 million total assets thresholds or the individual $100 million personal net worth
standard, regardless of the size of the member's total interest in the applicant.

Applicants must be prepared to demonstrate that the limited partners do not have influence over the affairs of the

159. The attribution levels we have selected here are intended to balance the competing considerations that apply
in this particular context and may differ from those we have used in other circumstances. As a general matter, the 25
percent limitation on equity investment interests will serve as a safeguard that the very large entities who are excluded
from bidding in these blocks do not, through their investments in qualified firms, circumvent the gross revenue/total
asset caps. At the same time, it will afford qualified bidders a reasonable measure of flexibility in obtaining needed
financing from other entities, while ensuring that such entities do not acquire controlling interests in the eligible
bidders.
<FOOTCITE>136</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, the five percent threshold for attributing revenues of investors with voting stock in corporate applicants
is designed to keep ineligible parties from exerting undue control over eligible firms.
<FOOTCITE>137</FOOTCITE>
 For all of these reasons, we also will attribute the gross revenues and total assets of entities, or the personal net
worth of individuals, that otherwise constitute ``affiliates'' of the applicant.

Qualified Woman and Minority-Owned ``Entrepreneurs''.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As discussed above, the record demonstrates that women and minorities have especially acute problems in obtaining
financing, due in part to discriminatory lending practices by private financial institutions. To address these
special problems and to afford women and minority-owned businesses more flexibility in attracting financing, it
is necessary to provide these entities with an alternative, somewhat more relaxed option regarding the attribution
of revenues of passive investors. Under this alternative standard, we will not attribute to the applicant the gross
revenues, assets, or net worth of any single investor in a minority or woman-owned applicant unless it holds more than
49.9 percent of the passive equity (which is defined to include as much as five percent of a corporation's voting stock).
To guard against abuses, however, the control group of applicants choosing this option would have to own at least 50.1
percent of the applicant's equity, as well as retain control and hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
<FOOTCITE>139</FOOTCITE>
 As discussed above with regard to general eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, winning bidders must identify
on their long-form applications a control group (this time consisting entirely of minorities and/or women or entities
100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women) and the gross revenues and net worth of each member of
the control group and each member's affiliates will be counted toward the $125 million gross revenue/$500 million
total asset thresholds or the individual $100 million personal net worth limitation, regardless of the size of the
member's total interest in the applicant.

161. Relaxing the attribution standard somewhat in determining eligibility of women and minority-owned companies
to bid for licenses on frequency blocks C and F directly addresses what most commenters have stated to be the biggest
obstacle to entry for these designated entities: obtaining adequate financing. By this measure, women and minorities
who are eligible to bid in these blocks (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, who otherwise meet the $125 million gross revenues/$500 million total asset standard) will be required to maintain
control of their companies and, at the same time, will have flexibility to attract significant infusions of capital
from a single investor. The requirement that the minority and women principals hold 50.1 percent of the company's
equity mitigates substantially the danger that a well-capitalized investor with a substantial ownership stake
will be able to assume 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control of the applicant. Because this step gives large companies, who are otherwise ineligible to bid in the entrepreneurs'
blocks, a significant incentive to ``partner'' with minority and women-owned firms, it will enhance the likelihood
that these designated entities will be both successful in the auctions and become viable, long-term competitors
in the PCS industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
162. Of course, women and minority-owned firms, like any other applicant for a C or F block license, may sell a larger
portion of their companies' equity, provided that they also abide by the general eligibility requirements to bid
in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Specifically, the gross revenues, total assets and net worth of all investors holding
25 percent or more of the company's passive equity (as defined to include 5 percent or more of the voting stock) will
be attributed toward the $125 million/$500 million caps or the $100 million personal net worth standard. In this event,
the control group will be required to hold at least 25 percent of the company's equity and 50.1 percent of its voting
stock.

We also believe that these attribution rules may impose a particular hardship on publicly traded companies, which

for purposes of determining eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, we adopt an exception from these rules
for publicly traded companies.
<FOOTCITE>140</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, we will not attribute the gross revenues or total assets of a shareholder in a publicly traded company
that owns up to 25 percent of the corporation's equity, even if that equity is represented by up to 15 percent of the voting
stock. To take advantage of this exception, however, the eligible control group of the applicant still must control
the corporation, hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock, and at least 25 percent of the company's equity.

We note that this exception for publicly held companies is only applicable for purposes of assessing eligibility
to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks and for the general installment payment option. In the event that a publicly traded
company can demonstrate that the 15 percent threshold would impose a serious hardship, the Commission would entertain
a request to raise the threshold in individual cases. Companies seeking such relief must also demonstrate that raising
the threshold would not contravene the Commission's control objectives, as described in this Order. We do not believe,
however, that publicly traded corporations with individual shareholders owning up to 15 percent active equity require
additional special provisions such as bidding credits, ``enhanced'' installment payments, or tax certificates
to overcome capital access problems. Thus, we will not apply this exception with regard to the small business definition
or the definition of a woman or minority-owned business.

 control of the firms that are eligible for special treatment under the rules for broadband PCS. For this purpose, we
shall borrow from certain SBA rules that are used to determine when a firm should be deemed an affiliate of a small business.
<FOOTCITE>142</FOOTCITE>
 These SBA rules, which are codified in 13 CFR 121.401, provide several specific examples of instances in which an entity
might have control of a firm even though the entity has less than 50 percent of the voting stock of a concern, and thus
provide a useful model for our rules. Through reference to circumstances such as those described in the SBA rules,
our rules will expressly alert designated entities that control of the applicant through ownership of 50.1 percent
of the firm's voting interests may be insufficient to ensure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control of the applicant if, for example, the voting stock of the eligible control group is widely dispersed. In those
and other circumstances, ownership of 50.1 percent of the voting stock may be insufficient to assure control of the
applicant. Of course, apart from these structural issues relative to control, eligible entities must not, during
the license term, abandon control of their licenses through any other mechanism. As we stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

To ensure that the control group has a substantial financial stake in the venture, we shall adopt certain additional
requirements, also borrowed from SBA rules. As noted previously, we shall require that at least 50.1 percent of each
class of voting stock and at least 25 percent (or 50.1 percent for the alternative option for minority and women-owned
businesses) of the aggregate of all outstanding shares of stock to be unconditionally owned by the control group members.
In addition, 50.1 percent of the annual distribution of dividends paid on the voting stock of a corporate applicant
concern must be paid to these members. Also, in the event stock is sold, the control group members must be entitled to
receive 100 percent of the value of each share of stock in his or her possession. Similarly, in the event of dissolution
or liquidation of the corporation, the control group members must be entitled to receive at least 25 percent (or 50.1
percent, as the case may be) of the retained earnings of the concern and 100 percent of the value of each share of the stock
in his or her possession, subject, of course, to any applicable laws requiring that debt be paid before distribution
of equity.

Application of the Five-Year Holding Rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, we explain how these attribution rules apply with regard to the five-year holding and limited transfer period
for C and F block licensees. During this five-year period, a C or F block licensee must not sell more than 25 percent of
its passive equity to a single investor if the resulting attribution of that investor's gross revenues or total assets
would bring the company over the $125 million gross revenues/$500 million total assets thresholds, or if that investor's
personal net worth exceeds the $100 million personal net worth cap. Similarly, while individual members of the control
group may change (if it would not result in a transfer of control of the company), the control group must maintain control
and at least 25 percent of the equity and 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
<FOOTCITE>144</FOOTCITE>
 A company will be permitted to grow beyond these gross revenues/total assets caps, however, through equity investment
by non-attributable (i.e. passive) investors, debt financing, revenue from operations, business development
or expanded service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in their eligibility, and we intend to conduct random audits both before the auctions and during the 10-year initial
license period to ensure that our rules are complied with in letter and spirit. If we find that large firms or individuals
exceeding our personal net worth caps are able to assume control of licensees in the entrepreneurs' blocks or otherwise
circumvent our rules, we will not hesitate to force divestiture of such improper interests or, in appropriate cases,
issue forfeitures or revoke licenses. In this regard, we reiterate that it is our intent, and the intent of Congress,
that women, minorities and small businesses be given an opportunity to participate in broadband PCS services, not
merely as fronts for other entities, but as active entrepreneurs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
169. The special provisions which we adopt for designated entities are based, in part, on our mandate to fulfill the
congressional goal that we disseminate licenses among a wide variety of applicants. 47 U.S.C. &sect;309(j)(3)(B).
Therefore, in adopting the financial assistance measures set forth in this Report and Order, we are concerned about
the possibility, even if remote, that a few bidders will win a very large number of the licenses in the entrepreneurs'
blocks. As a consequence, the benefits that Congress intended for designated entities would be enjoyed, in disproportionate
measure, by only a few individuals or entities. Congress, in our view, did not intend that result. We shall therefore
take steps to ensure that the financial assistance provided through our rules is dispersed to a reasonable number
of applicants who win licenses in these blocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
170. To achieve a fair distribution of the benefits intended by Congress, we shall impose a reasonable limit on the
total number of licenses within the entrepreneurs' blocks that a single entity may win at auction. In setting this
limit, we shall take care not to impose a restriction that would prevent applicants from obtaining a sufficient number
of licenses to create large and efficient regional services. Specifically, we shall impose a limitation that no single
entity may win more than 10 percent of the licenses available in the entrepreneurs' blocks, or 98 licenses. These licenses
may all be in frequency block C or all in frequency block F, or in some combination of the two blocks. Such a limit will
ensure that at least ten winning bidders enjoy the benefits of the entrepreneurs' blocks. At the same time, it will
allow bidders to effectuate aggregation strategies that include large numbers of licenses and extensive geographic
coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
171. Further, this limitation will apply only to the total number of licenses that may be won at auctions in these blocks;
it is not an ownership cap that applies to licenses that might be obtained after the auctions. For purposes of implementing
this restriction, we shall consider licenses to be won by the same entity if an applicant (or other entity) that controls,
or has the power to control licenses won at the auction, controls or has the power to control another license won at the
auction.

definition upward to accommodate capital intensive telecommunications businesses.

The SBA has recently changed its net worth/net income standard as it applies to its Small Business Investment Company
(SBIC) Program. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
59 Fed. Reg. 16953, 16956 (April 8, 1994). The new standard for determining eligibility for small business concerns
applying for financial and/or management assistance under the SBIC program was increased to $18 million net worth
and $6 million after-tax net income. 15 CFR &sect;121.802(a)(3)(i). The change in this size standard was attributable
to an adjustment for inflation and changes in the SBIC program ``designed to strengthen and expand the capabilities
of SBICs to finance small businesses so that they can increase their contribution to economic growth and job creation.''
59 Fed. Reg. at 16955. However, Section 121.601, which was the SBA size standard cited in the Notice and the Second Report
and Order, has not been modified by the SBA. For purposes of our generic competitive bidding rules, in consultation
with the SBA, we will reexamine our $6 million net worth/$2 million annual profits definition in light of the SBA's
recent action.

173. Many commenters, including the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA, argue that the SBA net worth/net revenue
definition is too restrictive and will exclude businesses of sufficient size to survive, much less succeed, in the
competitive broadband PCS marketplace. The SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy and the Suite 12 Group advocate adoption
of a gross revenue test, arguing that a net worth test could be misleading as some very large companies have low net worth.
The SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy recommends that the revenue standard be raised to include firms that (together
with affiliates) have less than $40 million in gross revenue. Similarly, Suite 12 suggests a $75 million in annual
sales threshold.
<FOOTCITE>147</FOOTCITE>
 As another option, the SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy suggests that the Commission consider a higher revenue ceiling

comments of SBA Associate Administrator for Procurement Assistance at 2, CFW Communications at 2, and Iowa Network

of this alternative SBA definition would open up a huge loophole in the designated entity eligibility criteria. Specifically,
they contend that telecommunications is a capital, rather than labor, intensive industry, and that an entity with
1,500 employees is likely to be extremely well capitalized and have no need for the special treatment mandated by Congress
in the Budget Act.

174. We expect broadband PCS to be a highly capital intensive business requiring bidders to expend tens of millions
of dollars to acquire a license and construct a system even in the smaller broadband PCS markets. Thus, we believe that
our current small business definition is overly restrictive because it would exclude most businesses possessing
the financial resources to compete successfully in the provision of broadband PCS services. Accordingly, we modify
our small business definition for broadband PCS auctions to ensure the participation of small businesses with the
financial resources to compete effectively in an auction and in the provision of broadband PCS services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
175. There is substantial support in the record for a $40 million gross revenue standard. For example, the SBA recommends
that for broadband PCS, a small business be defined as one whose average annual gross revenues for its past three years
do not exceed $40 million.
<FOOTCITE>149</FOOTCITE>
 It states that this definition isolates those companies that have significantly greater difficulty in obtaining
capital than large enterprises. At the same time, the SBA contends that a company with $40 million in revenue is sufficiently
large that it could survive in a competitive wireless communications market.
<FOOTCITE>150</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy asserts that a $40 million threshold will allow participation by firms
``of sufficient size to meet demands in almost all small markets and some medium-size markets without significant
outside financial assistance.''
<FOOTCITE>151</FOOTCITE>
 For purposes of broadband PCS, we shall therefore define a small business as any firm, together with its attributable
investors and affiliates, with average gross revenues for the three preceding years not in excess of $40 million.
<FOOTCITE>152</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, an applicant will not qualify as a small business if any one attributable investor in, or affiliate of,
the entity has $40 million or more in personal net worth.

Unlike our eligibility criteria to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, we do not adopt a total assets standard here.

176. For purposes of determining whether an entity qualifies as a small business, we will follow the control group
and attribution rules set forth with regard to eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks. In particular, winning
bidders are required to identify on their long-form applications a control group that holds at least 50.1 percent

member's affiliates will be counted toward the $40 million gross revenue threshold, regardless of the size of the
member's total interest in the applicant. The $40 million personal net worth limitation will also apply to each member
of the control group. We will not consider the gross revenues or personal net worth of any other investor unless the
investor holds 25 percent or more of the outstanding passive equity in the applicant, which, as defined above, includes
as much as five percent of the voting stock in a corporate applicant.

177. We also adopt the more relaxed attribution standard set forth in the entrepreneurs' blocks section with regard
to investors in minority and female-owned applicants. Specifically, we will not consider the gross revenues or personal
net worth of a single passive investor in a minority or female-owned small business unless the investor holds in excess
of a 49.9 percent passive interest (which includes as much as five percent of a corporate applicant's voting stock),
provided the women or minority control group maintains at least 50.1 percent of the equity and, in the case of a corporate
applicant, at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock.
<FOOTCITE>154</FOOTCITE>
 We believe that such revenue attribution will ensure that only

small businesses are able to take advantage of the special provisions we have adopted, but will allow those businesses
to attract sufficient equity capital to be truly viable contenders in the PCS industry.

178. These financial eligibility rules will continue to apply throughout the license term. Thus, firms that received
bidding credits and ``enhanced'' installment payments based on their small business status will be subject to the
repayment penalties outlined above, if an investor subsequently purchases an ``attributable'' interest (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
25 percent or more of the firm's equity) and, as a result, the gross revenues of the firm exceed the $40 million gross
revenues cap, or the personal net worth of the investor exceeds the $40 million personal net worth threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
179. Finally, we will allow a consortium of small businesses to qualify for any of the measures adopted in this order
applicable to individual small businesses. As used here, the term ``consortium'' means a conglomerate organization
formed as a joint venture among mutually-independent business firms, each of which individually satisfies the definition
of a small business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
180. Several commenters argue that a consortium should not qualify for special treatment unless the consortium itself
meets the established definitional criteria.
<FOOTCITE>155</FOOTCITE>
 They contend that the FCC should not allow consortia to be used as a means of circumventing the usual prerequisites
for these special provisions. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we concluded that consortia might be permitted to receive benefits based on participation in the consortium by one
or more designated entities, but believed such a consortium should not be entitled to qualify for measures designed
specifically for designated entities. As a general matter, we shall continue to adhere to that principle. We think,
however, that in the broadband PCS service, allowing small businesses to pool their resources in this manner is necessary
to help them overcome capital formation problems and thereby ensure their opportunity to participate in auctions
and to become strong broadband PCS competitors. Because of the exceptionally large capital requirements in this
service, we agree with the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy that, so long as individual members of the consortium satisfy
the definition of a small business, the congressional objective of ensuring opportunities for small business will
be fully met. Individual small entities that join to form consortia, as distinguished from a single entity with gross
revenues in excess of $40 million, still are likely to encounter capital access problems and, thus, should qualify
for members aimed at small businesses. We do not believe however, that this congressional goal will be satisfied if
special measures are allowed for consortia that are ``predominantly'' or ``significantly'' owned and/or controlled
by small businesses, as recommended by several commenters.
<FOOTCITE>156</FOOTCITE>

and women-owned firms and thereby to ensure that these groups have the opportunity to participate and become strong
competitors in the broadband PCS service.
<FOOTCITE>157</FOOTCITE>
 We thus have adopted a tax certificate program for women and minorities to allow more sources of potential funding,
have relaxed the attribution standard used to determine eligibility to bid for licenses on frequency blocks C and
F, and have adopted special measures for installment payments and bidding credits.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There, we found generally that to establish ownership by minorities and women, a strict eligibility standard should
be adopted that required minorities or women to have at least a 50.1 percent equity stake and a 50.1 percent controlling
interest in the designated entity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at &para;277; 47 CFR &sect;1.2110(b)(2). For the broadband PCS auctions, we retain the requirement that minorities
and/or women control the applicant and hold at least 50.1 percent of a corporate applicant's voting stock. However,
to establish their eligibility for certain benefits, summarized below, we shall impose an additional requirement
that, even where minorities and women hold at least 50.1 percent of the applicant's equity, other investors in the
applicant may own only passive interests, which, for corporate applicants, is defined to include as much as five percent
of the voting stock. In addition, provided that certain restrictions are met, we shall also allow women and minority-owed
firms the option to reduce to 25 percent the 50.1 percent minimum equity amount that must be held.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
183. We emphasized in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that we did not intend to restrict the use of various equity financing mechanisms and incentives to attract financing,
provided that the minority and women principals continued to own 50.1 percent of the equity, calculated on a fully-diluted
basis, and that their equity interest entitled them to a substantial stake in the profits and liquidation value of
the venture relative to the non-controlling principals. We noted, however, that different standards that meet the
same objectives may be appropriate in other contexts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at &para;278. In view of the evidence of discriminatory lending experiences faced by minority and women entrepreneurs
and the exceptional great financial resources believed to be required by broadband PCS applicants, we conclude that
it is appropriate to allow more flexibility with regard to the 50.1 percent equity requirements for this service in
order to open doors to more sources of equity financing for women and minority-owned firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
184. We shall therefore allow women and minority-owned firms the following options. First, they may satisfy the general
definition set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which requires the minority and/or female principles to control the applicant, own at least 50.1 percent of its equity
and, in the case of corporate applicants, hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock. Under this option, other investors
may own as much as a 49.9 percent passive equity interest. As noted above regarding eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs'
blocks, passive equity in the corporate context means only non-voting stock may be held, or stock that includes no
more than five percent of the voting interests.
<FOOTCITE>158</FOOTCITE>
 For partnerships, the term means limited partnership interests that do not have the power to exercise control of the
equity. In addition, as required in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
all investor interests will be calculated on a fully-diluted basis, meaning that agreements such as stock options,
warrants and convertible debentures generally will be considered to have a present effect and will be treated as if
the rights thereunder have been fully exercised.
<FOOTCITE>159</FOOTCITE>
 We recognize that the requirement that other investors own only passive interests is a departure from the definition
of a minority or women-owned business adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
but because of the very significant financial contribution that may be made by such other investors in designated
entities, we believe that the passive equity requirement is appropriate as an additional safeguard to ensure that
minorities and/or women retain control of the applicant.

For example, under this option, a corporate applicant with two classes of issued and outstanding stock, 100 shares
of voting stock and 100 shares of non-voting stock, could sell to a single non-eligible entity 49.9 percent of the applicant's
equity, consisting of 5 shares of the corporate's voting stock and 94 shares of its non-voting stock. Under this scenario,
eligible minorities or women, in order to retain at least 50.1 percent of the value of all outstanding shares of the
corporation's stock, must own all of the corporation's remaining shares of stock; that is, 95 shares of voting stock
and six shares of non-voting stock.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As also noted in the Second Report and Order, we will consider departing from the requirement that the equity of investors
in minority and women-owned businesses must be calculated on a fully-diluted basis only upon a demonstration, in
individual cases, that options or conversion rights held by non-controlling principals will not deprive the minority
and women principals of a substantial financial stake in the venture or impair their rights to control the designated
equity.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
185. As a second option, women and minority-owned firms may sell up to 75 percent of the company's equity, provided
that no single investor may hold 25 percent or more of the firm's passive equity, which is defined in the same manner
as above. For example, a corporation with 100 shares of voting stock and 100 shares of non-voting stock, with the 200
shares representing the total outstanding shares of the company, could qualify as a minority or women-owned business
under the following circumstances. The minority or women principals would have to own at least 51 shares of voting
stock, which satisfies the requirement that they have voting control and, in this case, also meets the requirements
that they hold at least 25 percent of the equity. Two other investors could each own 44 shares of non-voting stock and
five shares of voting stock, which represents 24.5 percent of the company's equity for each of the shareholders. A
third investor could own the remaining 12 shares of non-voting stock and five shares of the voting stock, or 8.5 percent
of the equity. The remaining 34 shares of voting stock may be sold to other investors provided that no single investor
owns more than five shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
186. Whichever option is chosen, we will require establishment of a ``control group'' in much the same way we did for
purposes of eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Specifically, winning bidders, transferees or assignees
must identify on their long-form applications a control group (consisting entirely of minorities and/or women or
entities 100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and women) that has 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control of the applicant and holds either at least 50.1 or 25 percent of the applicant's equity, depending upon which
option is elected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
187. We believe that a modification of our 50.1 percent equity requirement will best achieve Congress' objective
of providing effective and long-term economic opportunities for women and minority-owned firms in broadband PCS.
At the same time, we shall maintain strict enforcement of the requirement that actual control reside with the qualified
designated entities. Thus, to establish their eligibility for tax certificates, enhanced installment payments,
bidding credits and relaxed cellular attribution rules, women and minority-owned applicants electing to use the
25 percent equity option may not in any instance allow an individual investor who is not in the control group to own more
than a 25 percent passive equity interest. This restriction will apply even in circumstances in which allowing an
investor to exceed these limitations would not result in the applicant's exceeding the gross revenues and other financial
standards that apply to other bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks and other situations involving financial caps.
These structural safeguards, as well as the general requirement that other investors hold only passive interests
in women and minority-owned applicants, will help to ensure that control truly remains with the women and minority
designated entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
188. For example, a women or minority-owned firm electing to use the 25 percent option may have a non-eligible investor
with more than a 25 percent passive stake and still qualify to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks or for benefits that
apply to small businesses, as long as the attributable revenues of the investor do not cause the applicant to exceed
the gross revenues/total assets caps. In these contexts, no additional restrictions are necessary, because women
and minority-owned applicants, like other applicants, are eligible to bid in these blocks and to qualify as small
businesses so long as they comply with the same restrictions on financial eligibility that apply to other applicants.
Since the attribution rule itself operates to ensure compliance with size limitations, it is not necessary to impose
additional restrictions on the size of interests held by investors with attributable interests. This firm will not
qualify, however, for special measures applicable only to women and minority-owned businesses, such as ``enhanced''
installment payments or the 15 or 25 percent bidding credits, because it has a single non-eligible investor with more
than a 25 percent passive interest. In circumstances in which women and minorities are required to retain only 25 percent
of the firm's equity, this additional structural restriction is appropriate because the objective in this context
is to ensure not merely financial eligibility, but that women and minorities retain control of the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
189. We set forth previously rules defining more explicitly the term ``control'' for purposes of determining whether
a ``control group'' maintains

de jure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control of an applicant.
<FOOTCITE>160</FOOTCITE>
 Those rules apply equally to the minority and women principals of minority and women-owned applicants. Consistent
with our general policies with regard to women-owned applicants for purposes of our multiple ownership and cross-ownership
rules in this broadcast context, we shall not adopt, at this time, any special rules or presumptions to determine whether
women-owned applicants exercise independent control of their firms.

190. Our requirement that control rest with minorities and/or women and the clarifications above ensure that parties
do not attempt to evade the statutory requirement to provide economic opportunities and ensure participation by
businesses owned by these groups. We reaffirm our commitment to investigate all allegations of fronts, shams or other
methods used by those who try to obtain a benefit to which they are not lawfully entitled. In this vein, we again admonish
parties that we will conduct random pre- and post-auction audits to ensure that applicants receiving these benefits
are

191. We also note here that we are departing from the provision in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that bars publicly traded companies from qualifying as minority and woman-owned businesses for purposes of participating
in auctions. Most of the steps taken to assist these designated entities in this Order (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
bidding credits and installment payments) are confined to winning bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks, where there
is a financial limit on the size of participants. Because of the expected large capital entry costs of broadband PCS,
we believe that even publicly traded companies owned by women and minorities that qualify to bid in blocks C and F require
additional measures, such as bidding credits and installment payments, to be able to participate successfully.
We emphasize, however, that the exception to the attribution rules for publicly traded companies to be eligible to
bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks does not apply here.
<FOOTCITE>161</FOOTCITE>
 To qualify for measures targeted exclusively to women and minority-owned businesses, a company must satisfy the
definition set forth in this section.

With regard to qualifying to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, we stated that we would not attribute the revenues or
assets of an investor that owns up to 15 percent of a publicly traded applicant's voting stock. For privately held companies,
the voting stock threshold is five percent. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
192. As noted above, applicants owned by women and minorities must meet the limitations on gross revenues, total assets
and personal net worth to qualify for entry into the entrepreneurs' blocks. The size limitations do not apply, however,
to all measures designed to assist applicants owned by minorities and/or women. The tax certificate policy applies
to all broadband PCS licenses and is not limited to licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Therefore, businesses
owned by minorities and women need not meet the gross revenue and other financial restrictions to qualify for tax certificates.
Similarly, the relaxed cellular attribution threshold for minority and women-owned firms adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is not limited to the entrepreneurs' blocks. Thus, minority and women-owned firms that do not meet the gross revenues,
total assets and net worth restrictions may nevertheless qualify for the 40 percent cellular attribution rule. But
minority and women-owned firms must satisfy the Commission's structural ownership requirements to receive the
benefits of tax certificates and the relaxed cellular attribution rule; that is, they are subject to the limitation
that interests held by investors who are not women and minorities must be passive.

 most of those responding to our tentative conclusion in the Notice concerning the definition of a rural telephone
company contended that the proposed definition, which was based on the standard contained in Section 63.58 of the
Commission's Rules, was too restrictive. A variety of more inclusive definitions were recommended.
<FOOTCITE>163</FOOTCITE>
 Some commenters advocated a definition in which a company would qualify if it satisfied either of two alternative
criteria based on population of communities served or number of access lines.
<FOOTCITE>164</FOOTCITE>
 Others advocated adoption of a definition focusing simply on the number of access lines provided.
<FOOTCITE>165</FOOTCITE>
 One commenter advocated a definition focusing exclusively on revenues rather than access lines, with the standard
for rural telephone company status at annual revenues under $100 million.
<FOOTCITE>166</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, some advocated a somewhat more restrictive definition.

195. Many commenters suggested limiting rural telephone eligibility to carriers serving communities with no more
than 10,000 inhabitants, asserting that such a standard better comports with common notions about which telephone
companies are ``rural.''
<FOOTCITE>168</FOOTCITE>
 A number of other commenters supported a definition of rural telephone company that would include a limitation on
the size of the company. OPASTCO, for example, asserted that such a limitation would comport with the statutory mandate
to ensure opportunity for rural telephone companies because ``the problem such companies face in the competitive
bidding arena'' is as much a function of their size as of the rural character of their service areas.''
<FOOTCITE>169</FOOTCITE>
 NTCA similarly contended that small companies have shown the interest and commitment needed to fulfill the explicit
statutory goal of ``rapid deployment of new *&blank;*&blank;* services for *&blank;*&blank;* those residing in
rural areas,'' citing as support a report on the deployment of digital switching by small LECs.
<FOOTCITE>170</FOOTCITE>
 Other parties suggested that we look to the unenacted antecedent of the Budget Act, S. 1134, in which a rural company
was defined as an entity that either (a) ``provides telephone exchange service by wire in a rural area'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a non-urbanized area containing no incorporated place with more than 10,000 inhabitants), (b) ``provides telephone
exchange service by wire to less than 10,000 subscribers,'' or (c) ``is a telephone utility whose income accrues to
a State or political subdivision thereof.''

Second Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we adopted a definition of ``rural telephone company'' that includes independently owned and operated local exchange
carriers that (1) do not serve communities with more than 10,000 inhabitants in the licensed area, and (2) do not have
more than 50,000 access lines, including all affiliates. 47 CFR &sect;1.2110(b)(3). We stated our belief that a limitation
on the size of eligible rural telephone companies is appropriate because Congress did not intend for us to give special
treatment to large LECs that happen to serve small rural communities.

 argue that the definition adopted for rural telephone companies may be too restrictive given the capital intensive
nature of broadband PCS.
<FOOTCITE>171</FOOTCITE>
 We also note that NTCA argued in its comments in this proceeding that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to use
the same criteria to define rural telephone companies in rules pertaining to different services, technologies,
and industries.

 Likewise, in an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 letter, OPASTCO states that by defining rural telephone company for purposes of broadband PCS as a local exchange
carrier with less than $100 million in revenue, the Commission will properly capture in the defined class locally-owned
telephone companies who are truly interested in providing services to rural areas.
<FOOTCITE>173</FOOTCITE>
 OPASTCO notes that the ``same universe of companies'' that would fall under such a revenue threshold would be captured
by a definition that includes all telephone companies having 100,000 or fewer access lines.

198. Our challenge in establishing a definition of a rural telephone company for broadband PCS is to achieve the congressional
goal of promoting the rapid deployment of this new service in rural areas by targeting only those telephone companies
whose service territories are predominantly rural in nature, and who are thus likely to be able to use on their existing
wireline telephone networks to build broadband PCS infrastructures to serve rural America. For purposes of our rules
governing broadband PCS licenses, we believe that this goal can best be achieved if we define rural telephone companies
as those local exchange carriers having 100,000 or fewer access lines, including all affiliates. We agree with OPASTCO
that such a definition will include virtually all of the telephone companies who genuinely are interested in providing
services to rural areas. This definition will encourage participation by legitimate rural telephone companies
without providing special treatment to large LECs. Therefore, we will better achieve the congressional goal of providing
service rapidly to rural areas without giving benefits to large companies that do not require such assistance. Rural
telephone companies that satisfy this definition thus will be eligible for rural partitioning, as discussed above.

199. Anchorage Telephone Company argues in a petition for reconsideration of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that our definition of a rural telephone company should include telephone companies that are owned by governmental
authorities. Anchorage contends that Congress meant to mandate special consideration not only for telephone carriers
serving rural areas but also for all municipally-owned telcos, even those with wholly or predominantly urban service
areas.
<FOOTCITE>176</FOOTCITE>
 This argument is based on its interpretation of the Senate bill that was antecedent to the enacted Budget Act. Anchorage
argues that the Senate bill containing the prototype of a mandate for special consideration for rural telephone companies
directed the FCC to grant ``rural program licenses'' to ``qualified'' common carriers and explicitly said that the
category of ``qualified'' carriers included all state-owned and municipally-owned telephone companies. Anchorage
further states that the report of the conference committee that drafted the Budget Act declares that the Senate's
``findings'' are incorporated by reference.
<FOOTCITE>177</FOOTCITE>
 Anchorage also asserts that without the aid of special assistance it and most other state-owned and municipal telcos
won't be able to purchase spectrum licenses at auction because it is politically infeasible for them to generate and
retain enough surplus revenue to fund such investments, due to popular aversion to increases in taxes or telephone
rates.

200. We find no merit in Anchorage's arguments. There is no specific evidence that Congress intended the term ``rural
telephone companies'' to include all state or municipally-owned telephone companies. To the contrary, the fact
that an antecedent bill contained an explicit mandate for preferential treatment of government-owned telephone
companies that was deleted from the enacted bill could just as easily be interpreted as an indication that Congress
rejected such a rule. Further, we disagree that state and municipal governments lack the means to participate successfully
in auctions. Such governments have substantial capabilities to raise funds through private financing, bond offerings
and taxation. Therefore, our definition of a rural telephone company will not encompass telephone companies that
are owned by government authorities.

201. Many of the eligibility criteria set forth above are based on the size of the entity applying for a broadband PCS
license and/or seeking special treatment under our designated entity policies. Each of these size standards ($125
million gross revenues/$500 million total assets/$100 million personal net worth, $40 million gross revenues/$40
million personal net worth, and 100,000 access lines) requires applicants to include, among other parties, ``affiliates''
when calculating their attributable gross revenues, total assets, net worth or access lines. This affiliation requirement
is intended to prevent entities that, for all practical purposes, do not meet these size standards from receiving
benefits targeted to smaller entities.
<FOOTCITE>179</FOOTCITE>
 We adopt specific affiliation rules for purposes of applying these eligibility criteria based in part on the Small
Business Administration's affiliation rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we referenced the SBA's affiliation rules for purposes of defining generally whether an entity qualifies as a small
business and gave examples of how the affiliation rules would be applied. We continue to believe that the SBA's affiliation
rules provide a solid foundation on which to build our own affiliation rules for purposes of the small business definition
for broadband PCS and for the other size standards adopted in this order.
<FOOTCITE>181</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, for purposes of these eligibility restrictions, we will again borrow from the SBA's rules for outside
affiliations. In addition, to ensure that applicants have clear guidance concerning these matters, we shall include
in our rules more detailed information concerning the circumstances in which an entity will be deemed an affiliate
of the applicant.

203. Like the eligibility rules we have adopted here governing size limitations for broadband PCS, the SBA's rules
provide that size determinations shall include the applicant and all of its ``affiliates.''
<FOOTCITE>182</FOOTCITE>
 At the outset, before considering in more detail all the types of affiliations that might exist when guided by the SBA
rules, we review briefly our own rules described above, concerning attributable interests. Those rules provide
that, so long as a control group is established, the gross revenues, assets or net worth of an investor in a PCS applicant
or licensee will be attributed to the applicant or licensee only if the investor holds more than 25 percent of the applicant's
passive equity or is part of a control group that controls the applicant. Therefore, only where an investor has such
attributable interests in the broadband PCS applicant or licensee do we need to examine whether the investor has a
relationship with other persons or outside entities that rises to the level of an affiliation with the PCS applicant,
and if so, whether the affiliate's revenues or net worth, when aggregated with the applicant's, exceed our size eligibility
thresholds.

General Principles of Affiliation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When such an attributable interest exists, an affiliation under the SBA rules would arise, first, from ``control''
of an entity or the ``power to control it.'' Thus, under the SBA rules, entities are affiliates of each other when either
directly or indirectly (i) one concern controls or has the power to control the other, or (ii) a third party or parties
controls or has the power to control both. 13 CFR &sect;121.401(a)(2)(i), (ii). In determining control, the SBA's
rules provide generally that every business concern is considered to have one or more parties who directly or indirectly
control or have the power to control it. The rules, in addition, provide specific examples of where control resides
under various scenarios, such as through stock ownership or occupancy of director, officer or management positions.
The rules also articulate general principles of control, and note, for example, that control may be affirmative or
negative and that it is immaterial whether control is exercised so long as the power to control exists. 13 CFR &sect;121.401(c)(1).
Second, an affiliation, under SBA rules, may also arise out of an ``identity of interest'' between or among parties.
13 CFR &sect;121.401(a)(2)(iii), (d). We shall adopt these same general provisions in our affiliation rules for
broadband PCS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
205. In adopting these affiliation rules, we emphasize that these rules will not be applied in a manner that defeats
the objectives of our attribution rules. Our attribution rules expressly permit applicants to disregard the gross
revenues, total assets and net worth of passive investors, provided that an eligible control group has 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control of the applicant. Our attribution rules are designed to preserve control of the applicant by eligible entities,
yet allow investment in the applicant by entities that do not meet the size restrictions in our rules. Therefore, so
long as the requirements of our attribution rules are met, the affiliation rules will not be used to defeat the underlying
policy objectives of allowing such passive investors. More specifically, if a control group has 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control of the applicant, we shall not construe the affiliation rules in a manner that causes the interests of passive
investors to be attributed to the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
206. Applying these SBA affiliation rules, and affiliation would arise, for example, where an entity with an attributable
interest in a broadband PCS applicant is under the control of another entity. An affiliation would also arise where
an entity with an attributable interest in a broadband PCS applicant controls, or has the power to control, another
entity. For example, if a 10 percent voting shareholder of a PCS applicant is also a shareholder in a large Corporation
X, when should Corporation X be deemed an affiliate of the PCS applicant as a result of the shareholder's ownership
interest in both entities? Under the SBA rules and the rules we adopt here, Corporation X would be deemed an affiliate
of the applicant if the shareholder controlled or had the power to control Corporation X, in which case, Corporation
X's gross revenues must be included in determining the applicant's gross revenues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
207. For purposes of determining control, ownership interests will be calculated on a fully-diluted basis. Thus,
for example, stock options, convertible debentures, and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle)
will generally be considered to have a present effect on the power to control or own an interest in either an outside
entity or the PCS applicant or licensee.
<FOOTCITE>183</FOOTCITE>
 We will treat such options, debentures, and agreements generally as though the rights held thereunder had been exercised.
<FOOTCITE>184</FOOTCITE>
 However, an affiliate cannot use such options and debentures to appear to terminate its control over or relationship
with another concern before it actually does so.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Example 1. If company ``A'' holds an option to purchase a controlling interest in company ``B,'' the situation is treated
as though company ``A'' had exercised its rights and had become owner of a controlling interest in company ``B.'' The
[annual revenues] of both concerns must be taken into account in determining size.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Example 2. If company ``A'' has entered into an agreement to merge with company ``B'' in the future, the situation is
treated as though the merger has taken place. [A and B are affiliates of each other].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
. SBA's rules provide this example:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If large company ``A'' holds 70% (70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company ``B'' and gives a third
party an option to purchase 66 of the 70 shares owned by company ``A,'' company ``B'' will be deemed to be an affiliate
of company ``A'' until the third party actually exercises its option to purchase such shares. In order to prevent large
company ``A'' from circumventing the intent of the regulation which [gives] present effect to stock options, the
option is not considered to have present effect in this case.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Voting and Other Trusts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a similar vein, we also borrow from the SBA's rules and our own rules in other services to find affiliation under certain
voting trusts in order to prevent a circumvention of eligibility rules. The SBA's rules provide that a voting trust,
or similar agreement, cannot be used to separate voting power from beneficial ownership of voting stock for the purpose
of shifting control of or the power to control an outside concern, if the primary purpose of the trust is to meet size
eligibility rules.
<FOOTCITE>186</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, under the Commission's broadcast multiple ownership rules, stock interests held in trust may be attributed
to any person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, has the sole power to sell such stock, has the right to revoke
the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will.
<FOOTCITE>187</FOOTCITE>
 Also, under the broadcast rules, if a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to the
grantor or the beneficiary of a trust, the stock interests held in trust will be considered assets of the grantor or
beneficiary, as appropriate.
<FOOTCITE>188</FOOTCITE>
 Because we believe the broadcast rules provide more definitive guidance in this particular area, we shall use them
as a model for the affiliation rules adopted here. Thus, for example, if an investor with an attributable interest
in a PCS applicant holds a beneficial interest in stock of another firm that amounts to a controlling interest in that
other firm, depending on the identity of the trustee, the other firm may be considered an affiliate and its assets and
gross revenues may be attributed to the PCS applicant.

Officers, Directors and Key Employees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the SBA's affiliation rules, affiliations also generally arise where persons serve as the officers, directors
or key employees of another concern and they represent a majority or controlling element of that other concern's board
of directors and/or management of the outside entity.
<FOOTCITE>189</FOOTCITE>
 We shall adopt an identical rule. Thus, if a person with an attributable interest in a broadband PCS applicant, through
his or her other key employment positions or positions on the board of another firm, controls that other firm, then
the other firm will be considered an affiliate of the applicant. Such affiliations may or may not result in the applicant's
exceeding our size limitations. As this rule reflects, for purposes of attributing the financial position of an outside
entity in this context, officers and directors of an outside concern are not foreclosed entirely from holding attributable
or non-attributable interests in a PCS applicant. Whether or not such persons control the outside entity, we also
do not want to prohibit these persons, who may be experienced in the telecommunications, finance, or communications
and equipment industries, from assisting start-up companies in PCS by serving as officers or directors of the applicant.
Thus, under our general attribution rule, if such persons serving as officers or directors of the applicant do not
control the applicant or otherwise have an attributable interest in the applicant, their outside affiliations (even
if controlling) will not be considered at all for purposes of determining the applicant's eligibility under our rules.

SBA's size standard affiliation rules also provide that affiliations can arise in a variety of other scenarios, such
as where one concern is dependent upon another for contracts and business, where firms share joint facilities, or
have joint venture of franchise license agreements. To the extent we believe these rules may have general applicability
in the context of our policies for broadband PCS, we shall codify them in our affiliate rules. We caution parties that
issues relating to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
control of the applicant (or parties with attributable interests in the applicant) could also arise under arrangements
not expressly codified in the rules.

Affiliation Through Identity of Interest: Family and Spousal Relationships. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As expressed in the SBA's rules, an affiliation may arise not only through control, but out of an ``identity of interest''
between or among parties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13 CFR &sect;121.401(a)(2)(iii). For example, affiliation can arise between or among members of the same family
or persons with common investments in more than one concern. In determining who controls or has the power to control
an entity, persons with an identity of interests may be treated as though they were one person. 13 CFR &sect;121.401(d).
For example, if two shareholders in Corporation X are both attributable shareholders in the PCS applicant, to the
extent that together they have the power to control Corporation X, Corporation X may be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211. Similarly, as under the SBA rules, we must consider spousal and other family relationships in determining whether
an affiliation exists. Under the SBA rules for determining small business status, for example, members of the same
family may be treated as though they were one person because they have an ``identity of interest.'' 13 CFR &sect;121.401(d).
Likewise, in order to determine whether individuals are economically disadvantaged, the SBA rules governing eligibility
for participation in the government's ``section 8(a)'' program for socially and economically disadvantaged small
businesses have special provisions for attributing spousal interests. The latter rules provide generally that
half of the jointly-owned interests of an applicant and his or her spouse must be attributed to the applicant for purposes
of determining the applicant's net worth. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13 CFR &sect;124.106(a)(2)(i)(A)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
212. In the context of the auction eligibility rules at issue here, we begin by clarifying that our reason for considering
spousal and kinship relationships is not to determine whether the spouse or other kin of a woman-owned applicant actually
is controlling the applicant, thereby violating our eligibility rules for woman-owned businesses. As discussed
above, our rules do not embody any presumptions concerning spousal control in that context.
<FOOTCITE>191</FOOTCITE>
 Rather, our objective here is to ensure both that entities permitted to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks are actually
in need of special financial assistance and that otherwise ineligible entities do not circumvent the rules prohibiting
entry by funding family members that purport to be eligible applicants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
213. In formulating these rules, we need to consider also that, as a practical matter, it will not be possible for us
prior to the auctions to resolve all questions that pertain to the individual circumstances of particular applicants.
Furthermore, if we determine subsequent to an auction that a winning bidder in fact was ineligible to bid because of
spousal or kinship relationships, not only will authorization of service be delayed but, as discussed above, disqualified
applicants may be subject to substantial penalties. In these circumstances, we think that the public interest requires
that we endeavor, insofar as possible, to establish brightline tests for determining when the financial interests
of spouses and other kin should be attributed to the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
214. We have decided that, for purposes of determining whether the financial limitations in our eligibility rules
have been met, we will in every instance attribute the financial interests of an applicant's spouse to the applicant.
This will resolve any concern that an applicant might transfer his or her assets to a spouse in order to satisfy the personal
net worth or control restrictions that apply to eligible entities. For example, an applicant could not transfer stock
or other assets to his or her spouse and thereby dispose of interests that, if held by the applicant, would render the
applicant ineligible. Just as importantly, this approach will resolve any concern that an applicant might participate
in bidding in the entrepreneurs' blocks by using the personal assets of an ineligible spouse, which would defeat entirely
the objective of excluding very large entities from bidding in these blocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
215. In adopting this rule, we fully recognize that instances could arise in which, if all factors were considered,
attributing a spouse's financial interests to the applicant could lead to harsh results. As a general matter, however,
we think it provides a workable bright-line standard that resolves fully our policy concerns and avoids undesirable
ambiguity concerning the nature of our requirements. As in the SBA rules, however, one exception is clearly warranted;
this affiliation standard would not apply if the applicant and his or her spouse are subject to a legal separation recognized
by a court of competent jurisdiction. In calculating their personal net worth, investors in the applicant who are
legally separated must, of course, still include their share of interests in community property held with a spouse.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
216. As indicated above, circumstances could also arise in which other kinship relationships are used as a means to
evade our eligibility requirements. Because we believe kinship relationships in many cases do not present the same
potential for abuse that exists with spousal relationships, particularly in terms of the ``identity of interests''
that are likely to exist between the persons involved, we shall adopt a more relaxed standard for determining when
kinship interests must be attributed to applicants. In this area, we shall follow the same standard that is applied
by the SBA when interpreting its ``identity of interest'' rule described above. Specifically, an identity of interests
between family members and applicants will be presumed to exist, but the presumption can be rebutted by showing that
the family members are estranged, or that their family ties are remote, or that the family members are not closely related
in business matters. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 933 F.2d 261 (5th Cir. 1990). For purposes of determining who is a family member under this rule, we shall use a definition
that is identical to the definition of ``immediate family member'' in the SBA's rules, 13 CFR &sect;124.100.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
217. In appropriate cases, an applicant should be able to rebut the presumption regarding kinship affiliations with
relative ease, simply by demonstrating that the applicant has no close relationship in business matters with the
relevant family members. Of course, should such business relationships arise with a winning applicant after the
auction, we might need to consider whether the applicant intended to circumvent the requirements of our eligibility
rules. Our holding period rule, which, as discussed above, requires that winning bidders in the entrepreneurs' blocks
maintain an ownership structure meeting our eligibility requirements for five years, will serve as an additional
safeguard against possible abuses arising from kinship relationships.

218. In fashioning rules for competitive bidding for broadband PCS licenses, we seek to promote the public policy
goals set forth for us by Congress. We believe that the rules adopted in this Fifth Report and Order satisfy this objective.
These rules should facilitate the rapid implementation of new broadband communications services through advanced
technologies and efficient spectrum use, thus advancing the public interest by providing consumers with competitive
and innovative wireless voice and data services and also fostering economic growth. The rules will allow for the public
to recover a portion of the value of the public spectrum, and will promote access to broadband PCS services by consumers,
producers and new entrants by ensuring that small businesses, rural telephone companies and businesses owned by
minorities and women will have genuine opportunities to participate in the auctions and in the provision of service.
We expect that the advent of PCS will benefit consumers by raising the overall level of competition in many already
competitive segments of the telecommunications industry and providing competition in others for the first time,
promote job creation in the communications and information sector of the domestic economy, and enhance productivity
and efficiency in industry as a whole.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Need for and purpose of the action. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule making proceeding was initiated to implement Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, as amended. The
rules adopted herein will carry out Congress's intent to establish a system of competitive bidding for broadband
PCS licenses. The rules adopted herein also will carry out Congress's intent to ensure that small businesses, rural
telephone companies, and businesses owned by women and minorities are afforded an opportunity to participate in
the provision of spectrum-based services.

Broadband PCS subject to competitive bidding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mutually exclusive initial applications to provide broadband PCS service are subject to competitive bidding procedures.
The general competitive bidding procedures found in 47 CFR Part 1, Subpart Q will apply unless otherwise provided
in this part.

&sect;24.702 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Competitive bidding design for Broadband PCS licensing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Commission will employ the following competitive bidding designs when choosing from among mutually exclusive
initial applications to provide broadband PCS service: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Simultaneous multiple round auctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Sequential auctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Commission may design and test alternative procedures. The Commission will announce by Public Notice before
each auction the competitive bidding design to be employed in a particular auction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations
of licenses, in addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that to be declared the high bid,
a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a specified amount or percentage. Combinatorial
bidding may be used with any type of auction design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine bidding for two or more substitutable licenses
and award licenses to the highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This technique may be used in
conjunction with any type of auction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;24.703

Competitive bidding mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sequencing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will establish and may vary the sequence in which broadband PCS licenses will be auctioned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Grouping. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the event the Commission uses either a simultaneous multiple round competitive bidding design or combinatorial
bidding, the Commission will determine which licenses will be auctioned simultaneously or in combination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reservation Price. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission may establish a reservation price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license subject
to auction will not be awarded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum Bid Increments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will, by announcement before or during an auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or percentage
terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Stopping Rules. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will establish stopping rules before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate an auction
within a reasonable time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Activity Rules. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will establish activity rules which require a minimum amount of bidding activity. In the event that
the Commission establishes an activity rule in connection with a simultaneous multiple round auction, each bidder
will be entitled to request and will be automatically granted one waiver of such rule during each auction stage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Suggested Minimum Bid. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission may establish suggested minimum bids on each license. Bids below the suggested minimum bid would count
as activity under the activity rule only if no bids at or above the suggested minimum bid are received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) When the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round auction pursuant to &sect;24.702(a)(1), the Commission
will impose penalties on bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an auction, who default on payments due
after an auction closes, or who are disqualified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A bidder who withdraws a high bid during the course of an auction will be subject to a penalty equal to the difference
between the amount bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission. No withdrawal
penalty would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount will be deducted
from any upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing bidder was deposited with the Commission.

Default or disqualification after close of auction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a high bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close of such an auction, the defaulting bidder will be subject
to the penalty in paragraph (a)(1) of this section plus an additional penalty equal to three (3) percent of the subsequent
winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the defaulting bidder's bid amount, the 3 percent penalty will
be calculated based on the defaulting bidder's bid amount. These amounts will be deducted from any upfront payments
or down payments that the defaulting or disqualified bidder has deposited with the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When the Commission conducts sequential oral auctions pursuant to &sect;24.702(a)(2), the Commission may modify
the penalties set forth in subsection (a) above to be paid in the event of bid withdrawal, default or disqualification;
provided, however, that such penalties shall not exceed the penalties specified above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If a bid is withdrawn before the Commission has declared the bidding to be closed for the license bid on, no bid withdrawal
penalty will be assessed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission has declared the bidding to be closed for the license bid on, the penalty
specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section will apply.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An applicant; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Nature of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
control 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in determining affiliation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Every business concern is considered to have one or more parties who directly or indirectly control or have the
power to control it. Control may be affirmative or negative and it is immaterial whether it is exercised so long as the
power to control exists.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An applicant owning 50 percent of the voting stock of another concern would have negative power to control such concern
since such party can block any action of the other stockholders. Also, the bylaws of a corporation may permit a stockholder
with less than 50 percent of the voting stock to block any actions taken by the other stockholders in the other entity.
Affiliation exists when the applicant has the power to control a concern while at the same time another person, or persons,
are in control of the concern at the will of the party or parties with the power to control.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Control can arise through stock ownership; occupancy of director, officer or key employee positions; contractual
or other business relations; or combinations of these and other factors. A key employee is an employee who, because
of his/her position in the concern, has a critical influence in or substantive control over the operations or management
of the concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Control can arise through management positions where a concern's voting stock is so widely distributed that
no effective control can be established.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In a corporation where the officers and directors own various size blocks of stock totaling 40 percent of the corporation's
voting stock, but no officer or director has a block sufficient to give him or her control or the power to control and
the remaining 60 percent is widely distributed with no individual stockholder having a stock interest greater than
10 percent, management has the power to control. If persons with such management control of the other entity are persons
with attributable interests in the applicant, the other entity will be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Identity of interest between and among persons. Affiliation can arise between or among two or more persons with
an identity of interest, such as members of the same family or persons with common investments. In determining if the
applicant controls or has the power to control a concern, persons with an identity of interest will be treated as though
they were one person.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Two shareholders in Corporation Y each have attributable interests in the same PCS applilcation. While neither shareholder
has enough shares to individually control Corporation Y, together they have the power to control Corporation Y. The
two shareholders with these common investments (or identity in Interest) are treated as though they are one person
and Corporation Y would be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Spousal Affiliation. Both spouses are deemed to own or control or have the power to control interests owned or controlled
by either of them, unless they are subject to a legal separation recognized by a court of competent jurisdiction in
the United States. In calculating their net worth, investors who are legally separated must include their share of
interests in property held jointly with a spouse.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Kinship Affiliation. Immediate family members will be presumed to own or control or have the power to control
interests owned or controlled by other immediate family members. In this context ``immediate family member'' means
father, mother, husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, sister, father- or mother-in-law, son- or daughter-in-law,
brother- or sister-in-law, step-father or -mother, step-brother or -sister, step-son or -daughter, half brother
or sister. This presumption may be rebutted by showing that
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The family members are estranged,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The family ties are remote, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The family members are not closely involved with each other in business matters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A owns a controlling interest in Corporation X. A's sister-in-law, B, has an attributable interest in a PCS application.
Because A and B have a presumptive kinship affiliation, A's interest in Corporation X is attributable to B, and thus
to the applicant, unless B rebuts the presumption with the necessary showing.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Affiliation through stock ownership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control a concern if he or she owns or controls or has the power
to control 50 percent or more of its voting stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control a concern even though he or she owns, controls or
has the power to control less than 50 percent of the concern's voting stock, if the block of stock he or she owns, controls
or has the power to control is large as compared with any other outstanding block of stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If two or more persons each owns, controls or has the power to control less than 50 percent of the voting stock of
a concern, such minority holdings are equal or approximately equal in size, and the aggregate of these minority holdings
is large as compared with any other stock holding, the presumption arises that each one of these persons individually
controls or has the power to control the concern; however, such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control
or power to control, in fact, does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible debentures, and agreements to merge. Stock options, convertible
debentures, and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) are generally considered to have a present
effect on the power to control the concern. Therefore, in making a size determination, such options, debentures,
and agreements are generally treated as though the rights held thereunder had been exercised. However, an affiliate
cannot use such options and debentures to appear to terminate its control over another concern before it actually
does so.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If company B holds an option to purchase a controlling interest in company A, who holds an attributable interest in
a PCS application, the situation is treated as though company B had exercised its rights and had become owner of a controlling
interest in company A. The gross revenues of company B must be taken into account in determining the size of the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If a large company, BigCo, holds 70% (70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company A, who holds an attributable
interest in a PCS application, and gives a third party, SmallCo, an option to purchase 50 of the 70 shares owned by BigCo,
BigCo will be deemed to be an affiliate of company A, and thus the applicant, until SmallCo actually exercises its option
to purchase such shares. In order to prevent BigCo from circumventing the intent of the rule which requires such options
to be considered on a fully diluted basis, the option is not considered to have present effect in this case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If company A has entered into an agreement to merge with company B in the future, the situation is treated as though the
merger has taken place.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) Affiliation under voting trusts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Stock interests held in trust shall be deemed controlled by any person who holds or shares the power to vote such
stock, to any person who has the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the right to revoke the trust at
will or to replace the trustee at will.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary,
the stock interests held in trust will be deemed controlled by the grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the primary purpose of a voting trust, or similar agreement, is to separate voting power from beneficial ownership
of voting stock for the purpose of shifting control of or the power to control a concern in order that such concern or
another concern may meet the Commission's size standards, such voting trust shall not be considered valid for this
purpose regardless of whether it is or is not recognized within the appropriate jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(7) Affiliation through common management. Affiliation generally arises where officers, directors, or key employees
serve as the majority or otherwise as the controlling element of the board of directors and/or the management of another
entity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Affiliation through common facilities. Affiliation generally arises where one concern shares office space
and/or employees and/or other facilities with another concern, particularly where such concerns are in the same
or related industry or field of operations, or where such concerns were formerly affiliated, and through these sharing
arrangements one concern has control, or potential control, of the other concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Affiliation through contractual relationships. Affiliation generally arises where one concern is dependent
upon another concern for contracts and business to such a degree that one concern has control, or potential control,
of the other concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Affiliation under joint venture arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A joint venture for size determination purposes is an association of concerns and/or individuals, with interests
in any degree or proportion, formed by contract, express or implied, to engage in and carry out a single, specific business
venture for joint profit for which purpose they combine their efforts, property, money, skill and knowledge, but
not on a continuing or permanent basis for conducting business generally. The determination whether an entity is
a joint venture is based upon the facts of the business operation, regardless of how the business operation may be designated
by the parties involved. An agreement to share profits/losses proportionate to each party's contribution to the
business operation is a significant factor in determining whether the business operation is a joint venture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The parties to a joint venture are considered to be affiliated with each other.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) Requests for waiver.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A waiver of these rules may be granted upon application or by the Commission on its own motion. Requests for waivers
shall contain a statement of reason sufficient to justify a waiver. Waivers will not be granted except upon an affirmative
showing:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) That the underlying purpose of the rule will not be served, or would be frustrated, by its application in a particular
case, and that grant of the waiver is otherwise in the public interest; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) That the unique facts and circumstances of a particular case render application of the rule inequitable, unduly
burdensome or otherwise contrary to the public interest. Applicants must also show the lack of a reasonable alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the information necessary to support a waiver request is already on file, the applicant may cross-reference
to the specific filing where it may be found.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Denial of waiver, alternate showing required. If a waiver is not granted, the application will be dismissed as
defective unless the applicant has also provided an alternative proposal which complies with the Commission's rules
(including any required showings).

authority to install and/or operate new or modified equipment. Any such request may be submitted as an informal application
in the manner set forth in &sect;24.805 and must contain full particulars as to the proposed operation including all
facts sufficient to justify the temporary authority sought and the public interest therein. No such request will
be considered unless the request is received by the Commission at least 10 days prior to the date of proposed construction
or operation or, where an extension is sought, at least 10 days prior to the expiration date of the existing temporary
authorization. The Commission may accept a late-filed request upon due showing of sufficient reasons for the delay
in submitting such request.

(1) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 30 days and no application for regular operation is contemplated
to be filed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 60 days pending the filing of an application for such regular operation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The authorization is to permit interim operation to facilitate completion of authorized construction or to provide
substantially the same service as previously authorized; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The authorization is made upon a finding that there are extraordinary circumstances requiring operation in the
public interest and that delay in the institution of such service would seriously prejudice the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Temporary authorizations of operation not to exceed 180 days may be granted under the standards of Section 309(f)
of the Communications Act where extraordinary circumstances so require. Extensions of the temporary authorization
for a period of 180 days each may also be granted, but the applicant bears a heavy burden to show that extraordinary circumstances
warrant such an extension.

otherwise in furtherance of the war effort, or in cases of emergency where the Commission finds that it would not be
feasible to secure renewal applications from existing licensees or otherwise to follow normal licensing procedure,
the Commission will grant radio station authorizations and station licenses, or modifications or renewals thereof,
during the emergency found by the Commission or during the continuance of any such national emergency or war, as special
temporary licenses, only for the period of emergency or war requiring such action, without the filing of formal applications.

(a) All applications for the initial provision of broadband PCS must be submitted on FCC Forms 175 and 175&hyph;S.
Mutually exclusive initial applications in the broadband Personal Communications Services are subject to competitive
bidding. FCC Form 401 (``Application for New or Modified Common Carrier Radio Station Under Part 22'') must be submitted
by each winning bidder for each broadband PCS license for which application was made on FCC Form 175. In the event that
mutual exclusivity does not exist between applicants for a broadband PCS license that have filed FCC Form 175, the
sole applicant will be required to file FCC Form 401. The aforementioned Forms 175, 175&hyph;S, and 401 are subject
to the provisions of 47 CFR Part 1, Subpart Q (``Competitive Bidding Proceedings'') and Subpart H of this Part. Blanket
licenses are granted for each market frequency block. Applications for individual sites are not needed and will not
be accepted.

(b) Applications received for filing are given a file number. The assignment of a file number to an application is merely
for administrative convenience and does not indicate the acceptance of the application for filing and processing.
Such assignment of a file number will not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of the application if it is found
to be not in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Acceptance of an application for filing merely means that it has been the subject of a preliminary review as to completeness.

date of a public notice listing the application, or any major amendments thereto, as acceptable for filing; provided,
however, that the Commission will not grant an application filed on Form 401 filed either by a winning bidder or by an

(a) Except as provided under &sect;24.829, any application may be dismissed without prejudice as a matter of right
if the applicant requests its dismissal prior to designation for hearing or, in the case of applications filed on Forms
175 and 175&hyph;S, prior to auction. An applicant's request for the return of his application after it has been accepted
for filing will be considered to be a request for dismissal without prejudice. Applicants requesting dismissal of
their applications may be subject to penalties contained in &sect;1.2104 of this Chapter. Requests for dismissal
shall comply with the provisions of &sect;24.829 as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A request to dismiss an application without prejudice will be considered after designation for hearing only if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A written petition is submitted to the Commission and is properly served upon all parties of record, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The petition complies with the provisions of &sect;24.829 (whenever applicable) and demonstrates good cause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Commission will dismiss an application for failure to prosecute or for failure to respond substantially within
a specified time period to official correspondence or requests for additional information. Dismissal shall be without
prejudice if made prior to designation for hearing or prior to auction, but dismissal may be made with prejudice for
unsatisfactory compliance with &sect;24.829 or after designation for hearing or after the applicant is notified
that it is the winning bidder under the auction process.

Procedures; Prohibition of Collusion), this section applies to applicants and all other parties interested in pending
applications who wish to resolve contested matters among themselves with a formal or an informal agreement or understanding.
This section applies only when the agreement or understanding will result in:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A major change in the ownership of an applicant to which &sect;&sect;24.823(c) and 24.823(g) apply or which would
cause the applicant to lose its status as a designated entity under &sect;24.709, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of any pending application amendment, petition
or other pleading.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

of either pleadings or applications shall at the time of filing notify the Commission that such filing is the result
of an agreement or understanding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The provisions of &sect;22.927 of the Commission's Rules will apply in the event of the filing of petitions to deny
or other pleadings or informal objections filed against broadband PCS applications. The provisions of &sect;22.928
of the Commission's Rules will apply in the event of dismissal of broadband PCS applications. The provisions of &sect;22.929
of the Commission's Rules will apply in the event of threats to file petitions to deny or other pleadings or informal
