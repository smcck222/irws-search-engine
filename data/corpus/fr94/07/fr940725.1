<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing a supplement to the proposed rule concerning the environmental
review for renewal of operating licenses. The supplement would revise the definition of purpose and need for the proposed
Federal action that will be used in the environmental review of applications for renewal of nuclear power plant operating
licenses. This action was developed in response to public comments on the proposed rule. The redefinition presented
in the supplement to the proposed rule would also affect the identification of alternatives to the proposed action
that will be considered in environmental reviews for license renewal.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 17, 1991 (56 FR 47016), the NRC published in the Federal Register proposed amendments to its environmental
protection regulations, 10 CFR Part 51, that would establish new requirements for the environmental review of applications
to renew operating licenses for nuclear power plants. Concurrently, the NRC published NUREG&hyph;1437,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 a draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) that contained the analysis which NRC proposed to codify in
10 CFR Part 51. In commenting on the proposed rule and the draft GEIS, a number of States expressed dissatisfaction
with the treatment of need for generating capacity, alternative energy sources, and certain other issues. They expressed
strong concerns that the proposed rule would intrude adversely on traditional State regulatory authority over these
matters. They expressed concern that designation of need for generating capacity and alternative energy sources
as Category 1
<FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 issues would substantially eliminate public participation, would adversely affect independent State consideration
of these matters, and would inadequately provide for use of current, project specific information.

The Commission instructed the NRC staff to develop an options paper for responding to these State concerns, to solicit
State views on the options, and to present these options to the Commission. To facilitate discussion of these matters
the NRC staff developed an options paper entitled ``Addressing The Concerns Of States And Others Regarding The Role
Of Need For Generating Capacity, Alternative Energy Sources, Utility Costs, And Cost-Benefit Analysis In NRC Environmental
Reviews For Relicensing Nuclear Power Plants: An NRC Staff Discussion Paper.'' A

The workshops were held during the month of February 1994, in Rockville, MD (February 9, 1994), Rosemont, IL (February
15, 1994), and Chicopee, MA (February 17, 1994). Discussants represented seven States, the National Association
of Utility Regulatory Commissioners, three public advocacy groups, the Nuclear Utility Management and Resources
Council (now known as the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI)) and the NRC. Representatives of several other States, public
advocacy groups, and industry actively participated from the floor. A transcript of each workshop was taken. Subsequent
to the workshops, written comments were filed by eight States, three public advocacy groups, the Nuclear Energy Institute
(NEI) and two utilities. In addition, subsequent to the workshops and receipt of most of the written comments, the
NRC staff met with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Council on Environmental Quality to discuss
the staff's proposed options and the comments and options offered by the States. EPA submitted written comments on
May 11, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their written submittal, NEI and Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC) each presented an approach to the handling
of need and alternatives in the rule that they believe would resolve the concerns expressed by the States. These proposals
had not been adequately developed for discussion at the time of the regional workshops. Because the NRC staff needed
to better understand these proposals before reporting to the Commission on a recommended approach, a public meeting
with NEI and YAEC was held on May 16, 1994. The meeting was announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (May 4, 1994; 59 FR 23030). Participants in the regional workshops were notified of the meeting in advance and later
furnished with the meeting transcript. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the range of options, the NRC staff has narrowed its consideration to two basic approaches to the
treatment of ``purpose and need'' and ``alternatives'' that will best satisfy the concerns of the States and meet
the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). One approach has been proposed by the State
of New York and was endorsed by several other States. The other approach, recommended in this document, was developed
by the NRC staff after consideration of the meeting transcripts and written comments. Borrowing from some of the elements
of the YAEC and NEI proposals, the NRC staff has developed its own approach which it believes would contribute substantially
to resolving the concerns raised by the States. Both approaches are discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The State Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The approach proposed by the State of New York is a modification of the Option 2 as discussed in the NRC staff options
paper. There are three major elements to the State option. Quoting from the written submittal of the State of New York:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. the text of the actual rule should be modified to include, and each individual relicensing decision should include,
statements that the NRC's findings with respect to need for generating capacity and alternative energy sources are
only intended to assist the NRC in meeting its NEPA obligations and do not preclude the States from making their own
determinations with respect to these issues; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. determinations regarding the issues of need for generating capacity and alternative energy sources should be
designated ``Category 3'' conclusions requiring site-specific review, rather than ``Category 1'' generic conclusions;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. all NRC project specific EIS and relicensing decisions should make reference to State determinations on the
issues of need for generating capacity and alternative energy sources, and should defer to and be guided by those State
determinations to the maximum degree possible pursuant to NEPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose and need for the proposed Federal action (renewal of an operating license) continues to be defined in terms
of the need for power. This approach would address some of the State concerns because the NRC would no longer perform
the alternatives and need for power analyses unless State analyses of these issues were inadequate or non-existent.
The NRC staff does not recommend this option, however, for several reasons. First of all, the NRC would have to develop
guidelines for determining the acceptability of State analyses. Some States may view the application of these guidelines
as an intrusion on their planning process. In addition, some States may not be prepared to submit the required information
to the NRC in a timely fashion given the differing time-tables used by States in their energy planning process. Finally,
some States may not be capable of submitting the required information to the NRC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Recommended Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the information gathered at the various public meetings and from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written comments, the NRC staff has developed the following recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach. The major features of the recommended approach are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Redefine the purpose and need for the proposed action (renewal of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating license) as preserving continued operation of a nuclear power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant as a safe option that State regulators and utility officials may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider in their future energy planning decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Consider a range of alternatives to the proposed action to identify any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action that may reasonably serve the stated purpose and need. Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the environmental impacts of any such alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Consider the environmental consequences of the ``no action'' alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to license renewal, which the NRC is required to do by NEPA, i.e., the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impact of a range of energy sources that might be used if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC should preclude the option of continued operation (license renewal). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Change NRC's NEPA decision standard for license renewal so that renewal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not depend on an NRC conclusion that operation is the preferred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NEPA option. Instead, license renewal would depend on an NRC conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that continued operation of a nuclear power plant is within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable range of alternatives considered and should not be rejected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an option for future consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the NRC staff's recommended approach, the definition of the purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and need of the Federal action in the GEIS would read: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose and need of the proposed action is to preserve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option of continued operation of the nuclear power plant for State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulators and utility officials in their future energy planning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In formulating this proposed purpose and need statement, the NRC staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has attempted to consider the perspective of State regulators, the needs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license renewal applicants, the nature of the applications at issue, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function that the NRC plays in the decisional process. This proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition does not indicate an endorsement by the NRC of nuclear power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation as a preferred energy source. Instead, the proposed definition is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to convey that, absent findings in the Atomic Energy Act safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review or in the NEPA environmental analysis that would lead the NRC to reject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a license renewal application, the NRC will not interfere with the energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning decisions of state regulators and utility officials. It would also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be explained in the GEIS that a renewed license is not a mandate nor a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commitment to operate but is simply documentation that the licensee can meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC's public health and safety requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GEIS would continue to include a full discussion of the environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of license renewal, the purpose and need for license renewal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives that can serve that purpose and need, the no action alternative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the environmental consequences of the no action alternative. In doing so, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC would fulfill its obligations under NEPA to consider alternatives to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed action. The GEIS would contain no discussion of need for power, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the economic competitiveness of nuclear power, or other economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations related to these issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In applying the proposed definition of purpose and need to the GEIS, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC staff has identified only two basic alternatives which reasonably flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the proposed approach: renewing an operating license, which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preserve the option, and not renewing the operating license (the no action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative), which would not preserve the option but is nevertheless required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under NEPA. The NRC staff will give further consideration to identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional alternatives and is soliciting public comment by means of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document. If any other reasonable alternatives are identified, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impacts associated with them will be assessed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the NRC staff will examine the environmental impacts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative sources of energy in its analysis of the no action alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation of the no action alternative, i.e., NRC's rejection of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license renewal application, would create a range of potential environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts including those impacts which would result from the possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement of the nuclear plant's power by some other source of energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, under the NRC staff's proposed approach, the NRC staff will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examine in the GEIS the full range of environmental impacts of other sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of energy in order to ensure a full consideration of the no action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC would use the statement of purpose and need as a basis for its decision standard in weighing the differences
between license renewal and the various alternatives involved. Final determinations concerning alternatives
in the GEIS would involve the following decision criterion: NRC would use the information on environmental impacts
to reject the license renewal option only if the data concerning environmental impacts and alternatives, including
the no action alternative, indicates that it would be unreasonable for the NRC to preserve the option of nuclear power
generation for future decision makers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the no action alternative, the NRC would reject the license renewal option only if the environmental impacts of
license renewal were so much worse than those of other sources of energy that the NRC would be justified in eliminating
the nuclear power plant as a tool for future energy planners. It would not be necessary for the NRC to find in the GEIS
that existing nuclear power plants will be the preferred source of energy. The NRC would only have to find that the environmental
impacts of nuclear plants place them within a ``reasonable range'' of future energy options viewed from the perspective
of environmental impacts. If, in an individual relicensing action, new and significant information created a doubt
concerning previous conclusions in the GEIS, the NRC would consider that information to determine if the previous
determinations in the GEIS were no longer valid for that particular plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This decision method used in the recommended approach would allow the NRC to take a hard look at the environmental impacts
of the proposed action and, at the same time, demonstrate an appreciation of the primacy and expertise of the States
in the area of energy planning. This proposed standard for decision making in the GEIS would differ from current NRC
practice for application of NEPA at the construction permit and the operating license stages and in the proposed amendments
to 10 CFR Part 51 for license renewal. Currently, at the construction permit stage, the NRC compares the proposed action
and the alternatives using a cost-benefit analysis which includes consideration of the need for power and other economic
considerations related to power generation. Under the current approach, the NRC rejects the licensing action if
the NEPA analysis demonstrates that an alternative is ``obviously superior.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recommended approach would avoid NRC determinations on such economic issues and, instead, focus NRC's analysis
in the GEIS on the environmental impacts of license renewal and the associated alternatives. For the purposes of the
license renewal GEIS, the proposed approach would replace the obviously superior standard with a standard which
requires the environmental impacts of the alternatives considered to be so superior to the impacts of nuclear power
as to justify the preclusion of nuclear plant operation as an option for future decision makers. In other words, based
on the analysis of environmental impacts, the proposed action must be in the ``reasonable range'' of alternatives
in order to justify NRC approval. Whether the definition of purpose and need proposed for the license renewal stage
should also be applied at the construction permit and operating license stage is under review by the NRC staff. That
determination will be made separately from the license renewal rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff believes that of the options considered, the recommended approach will resolve concerns expressed
by the States and meet the original objectives of the rulemaking, i.e., to increase regulatory efficiency and stability.
The NRC notes that the primary elements of this approach are a departure from past NRC practice as applied at the construction
permit and operating license stage. However, the proposed purpose and need statement and the reasonable range decision
standard represent an approach to this issue which reflects the differing set of circumstances pertinent to decisions
about continued operation of existing nuclear power plants. The NRC staff believes that the definition and explanation
of purpose and need and the identification and consideration of alternatives is consistent with the trend of current
NEPA case law which allows an agency to consider an applicant's wants when the agency formulates the goals of its own
proposed action (see e.g.,

, 17 F.3d 1502 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). Therefore, the staff believes that its approach will address the concerns of the States
and meet the requirements of NEPA at the same time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within 30 days from the close of the public comment period the NRC staff will report on the comments received. If the
public comments indicate opposition to this approach or the desirability of making significant modifications to
the approach, the NRC staff will seek Commission guidance. Otherwise the NRC staff intends to proceed with incorporation
of the recommended approach in the final GEIS and the final rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FDIC is proposing to amend its risk-based capital standards to recognize the risk reducing benefits of netting
arrangements. Under the proposal, state nonmember banks would be permitted to net, for risk-based capital purposes,
interest and exchange rate contracts (rate contracts) subject to legally enforceable bilateral netting contracts
that meet certain criteria. The FDIC is proposing these amendments on the basis of proposed revisions to the Basle
Accord which would permit the recognition of such netting arrangements. The effect of the proposed amendments would
be to allow state nonmember banks to net positive and negative mark-to-market values of rate contracts in determining
the current exposure portion of the credit equivalent amount of such contracts to be included in risk-weighted assets.

 include a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning assets and off-balance sheet items, including
interest and exchange rate contracts, to broad risk categories based primarily on credit risk. The FDIC adopted in
1989 similar frameworks to assess the capital adequacy of state nonmember banks. Banks must hold capital against
their overall credit risk, that is, generally, against the risk that a loss will be incurred if a counterparty defaults
on a transaction.

The Basle Accord is a risk-based framework that was proposed by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (Basle
Supervisors' Committee) and endorsed by the central bank governors of the Group of Ten (G&hyph;10) countries in July
1988. The Basle Supervisors' Committee is comprised of representatives of the central banks and supervisory authorities
from the G&hyph;10 countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland,
the United Kingdom, and the United States) and Luxembourg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the risk-based capital framework, off-balance sheet items are incorporated into risk-weighted assets by
first determining the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amounts for the items and then assigning the credit equivalent
amounts to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor, or if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the
collateral. For many types of off-balance sheet transactions, the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount is
determined by multiplying the face amount of the item by a credit conversion factor. For interest and exchange rate
contracts however, credit equivalent amounts are determined by summing two amounts: the current exposure and the
estimated potential future exposure.

Exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of 14 calendar days or less and instruments traded on exchanges
that require daily payment of variation margin are excluded from the risk-based ratio calculations.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current exposure (sometimes referred to as replacement cost) of a contract is derived from its market value. In
most instances the initial market value of a contract is zero.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A bank should mark-to-market all of its rate contracts to reflect the current market value of the transaction in light
of changes in the market price of the contracts or in the underlying interest or exchange rates. Unless the market value
of a contract is zero, one party will always have a positive mark-to-market value for the contract, while the other
party (counterparty) will have a negative mark-to-market value.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
An options contract has a positive value at inception, which reflects the premium paid by the purchaser. The value
of the option may be reduced due to market movements but it cannot become negative. Therefore, unless an option has
zero value, the purchaser of the option contract will always have some credit exposure, which may be greater than or
less than the original purchase price, and the seller of the option contract will never have credit exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A bank holding a contract with a positive mark-to-market value is ``in-the-money,'' that is, it would have the right
to receive payment from the counterparty if the contract were terminated. Thus, a bank that is in-the-money on a contract
is exposed to counterparty credit risk, since the counterparty could fail to make the expected payment. The potential
loss is equal to the cost of replacing the terminated contract with a new contract that would generate the same expected
cash flows under the existing market conditions. Therefore, the in-the-money institution's current exposure on
the contract is equal to the market value of the contract. An institution holding a contract with a negative mark-to-market
value, on the other hand, is ``out-of-the-money'' on that contract, that is, if the contract were terminated, the
institution would have an obligation to pay the counterparty. The institution with the negative mark-to-market
value has no counterparty credit exposure because it is not entitled to any payment from the counterparty in the case
of counterparty default. Consequently, a contract with a negative market value is assigned a current exposure of
zero. A current exposure of zero is also assigned to a contract with a market value of zero, since neither party would
suffer a loss in the event of contract termination. In summary, the current exposure of a rate contract equals either
the positive market value of the contract or zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second part of the credit equivalent amount for rate contracts, the estimated potential future exposure (often
referred to as the add-on), is an amount that represents the potential future credit exposure of a contract over its
remaining life. This exposure is calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the underlying contract
by a credit conversion factor that is determined by the remaining maturity of the contract and the type of contract.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The potential future credit exposure is calculated for all contracts, regardless of whether the mark-to-market
value is zero, positive, or negative.

For interest rate contracts with a remaining maturity of one year or less, the factor is 0% and for those over one year,
the factor is .5%. For exchange rate contracts with a maturity of one year or less, the factor is 1% and for those over
one year the factor is 5%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because exchange rate contracts involve an exchange of principal upon maturity and are generally more volatile,
they carry a higher conversion factor. No potential future credit exposure is calculated for single-currency interest-rate
swaps in which payments are made based on two floating indices (basis swaps).

 Each credit equivalent amount is then assigned to the appropriate risk category, according to the counterparty or,

is 50 percent.

This method of determining credit equivalent amounts for rate contracts is known as the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
current exposure method,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 which is used by most international banks. The Basle Accord permits, subject to each country's discretion, an alternative
method for determining the credit equivalent amount known as the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
original exposure method.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under this method, the capital charge is derived by multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by a
credit conversion factor, which varies according to the original maturity of the contract and whether it is an interest
or exchange rate contract. The conversion factors, which are greater than those used under the current exposure method,
make no distinction between current exposure and potential future exposure.

B. Netting and Current Risk-Based Capital Treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC and the Basle Supervisors' Committee have long recognized the importance and encouraged the use of netting
arrangements as a means of improving interbank efficiency and reducing counterparty credit exposure. Netting arrangements
are increasingly being used by institutions engaging in rate contracts. Often referred to as master netting contracts,
these arrangements typically provide for both payment and close-out netting. Payment netting provisions permit
an institution to make payments to a counterparty on a net basis by offsetting payments it is obligated to make with
payments it is entitled to receive and, thus, to reduce its costs arising out of payment settlements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Close-out netting provisions permit the netting of credit exposures if a counterparty defaults or upon the occurrence
of another event such as insolvency or bankruptcy. If such an event occurs, all outstanding contracts subject to the
close-out provisions are terminated and accelerated, and their market values are determined. The positive and negative
market values are then netted, or set off, against each other to arrive at a single net exposure to be paid by one party
to the other upon final resolution of the default or other event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential for close-out netting provisions to reduce counterparty credit risk, by limiting an institution's
obligation to the net credit exposure, depends upon the legal enforceability of the netting contract, particularly
in insolvency or bankruptcy.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this regard, the Basle Accord noted that while close-out netting could reduce credit risk exposure associated
with rate contracts, the legal status of close-out netting in many of the G&hyph;10 countries was uncertain and insufficiently
developed to support a reduced capital charge for such contracts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There was particular concern that a bank's credit exposure to a counterparty was not reduced if liquidators of a failed
counterparty might assert the right to ``cherry-pick,'' that is, demand performance on those contracts that are
favorable and reject contracts that are unfavorable to the defaulting party.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary criterion for determining whether a particular netting contract should be recognized in the risk-based
capital framework is the enforceability of that netting contract in insolvency or bankruptcy. In addition, the netting
contract as well as the individual contracts subject to the netting contract must be legally valid and enforceable
under non-insolvency or non-bankruptcy law, as is the case with all contracts.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
While payment netting provisions can reduce costs and the credit risk arising out of daily settlements with a counterparty,
such provisions are not relevant to the risk-based capital framework since they do not in any way affect the counterparty's
gross obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concern over ``cherry-picking'' led the Basle Supervisors' Committee to limit the recognition of netting in the
Basle Accord. The only type of netting that was considered to genuinely reduce counterparty credit risk at the time
the Accord was endorsed was netting accomplished by novation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under legally enforceable netting by novation, ``cherry-picking'' cannot occur and, thus, counterparty risk is
genuinely reduced. The Accord stated that the Basle Supervisors' Committee would continue to monitor and assess
the effectiveness of other forms of netting to determine if close-out netting provisions could be recognized for
risk-based capital purposes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Netting by novation is accomplished under a written bilateral contract providing that any obligation to deliver
a given currency on a given date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency and
value date. The previously existing contracts are extinguished and a new contract, for the single net amount, is legally
substituted for the amalgamated gross obligations. Parties to the novation contract, in effect, offset their obligations
to make payments on individual transactions subject to the novation contract with their right to receive payments
on other transactions subject to the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC's risk-based capital standards provide for the same treatment of rate contracts as the Basle Accord, but
require that banks use the current exposure method. The FDIC, in adopting its standards, generally stated it would
work with the Basle Supervisors' Committee in its continuing efforts with regard to the recognition of netting provisions
for capital purposes.

C. Basle Supervisors' Committee Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Basle Accord was adopted, a number of studies have confirmed that close-out netting provisions can serve
to reduce counterparty risk. In response to the conclusions of these studies, as well as to industry support for greater
acceptance of netting contracts under the risk-based capital framework, the Basle Supervisors' Committee issued
a consultative paper on April 30, 1993, proposing an expanded recognition of netting arrangements in the Basle Accord.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the proposal, for purposes of determining the current exposure amount of rate contracts subject to legally
enforceable bilateral close-out netting provisions (that is, close-out netting provisions with a single counterparty),
an institution could net the contracts' positive and negative mark-to-market values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The paper is entitled ``The Prudential Supervision of Netting, Market Risks and Interest Rate Risk.'' The section
applicable to netting is subtitled ``The Supervisory Recognition of Netting for Capital Adequacy Purposes.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, the Basle proposal states that a bank would be able to net rate contracts subject to a legally valid bilateral
netting contract for risk-based capital purposes if it satisfied the appropriate national supervisor(s) that:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) in the event of a counterparty's failure to perform due to default, bankruptcy or liquidation, the banking organization's
claim (or obligation) would be to receive (or pay) only the net value of the sum of unrealized gains and losses on included
transactions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) it has obtained written and reasoned legal opinions stating that in the event of legal challenge, the netting would
be upheld in all relevant jurisdictions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) it has procedures in place to ensure that the netting arrangements are kept under review in light of changes in relevant
law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Basle Supervisors' Committee agreed that if a national supervisor is satisfied that a bilateral netting contract
meets these minimum criteria, the netting contract may be recognized for risk-based capital purposes without raising
safety and soundness concerns. The Basle Supervisors' Committee proposal includes a footnote stating that if any
of the relevant supervisors is dissatisfied with the status of the enforceability of a netting contract under its
laws, the netting contract would not be recognized for risk-based capital purposes by either counterparty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Basle Supervisors' Committee is proposing that any netting contract that includes a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 walkaway clause 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be disqualified as an acceptable netting contract for risk-based capital purposes. A walkaway clause is a provision
in a netting contract that permits the non-defaulting counterparty to make only limited payments, or no payments
at all, to the estate of the defaulter even if the defaulter is a net creditor under the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, a state nonmember bank would calculate one current exposure under each qualifying bilateral
netting contract. The current exposure would be determined by adding together (netting) the positive and negative
market values for all individual interest rate and exchange rate transactions subject to the netting contract. If
the net market value is positive, that value would equal the current exposure. If the net market value is negative or
zero, the current exposure would be zero. The add-on for potential future credit exposure would be determined by calculating
individual potential future exposures for each underlying contract subject to the netting contract in accordance
with the procedure already in place in the Basle Accord.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A bank would then add together the potential future credit exposure amount (always a positive value) of each individual
contract subject to the netting arrangement to arrive at the total potential future exposure it has under those contracts
with the counterparty. The total potential future exposure would be added to the net current exposure to arrive at
one credit equivalent amount that would be assigned to the appropriate risk category.

Under the proposal, a state nonmember bank could net in this manner for risk-based capital purposes if it uses, as all
U.S. banking organizations are required to use, the current exposure method for calculating credit equivalent amounts
of rate contracts. Banks using the original exposure method would use revised conversion factors until market risk-related
capital requirements are implemented, at which time the original exposure method will no longer be available for
netted transactions.

D. The Banking Agencies' Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC concurs with the Basle Supervisors' Committee determination that the legal status of close-out netting
provisions has developed sufficiently to support the expanded recognition of such provisions for risk-based capital
purposes. Therefore, the FDIC is proposing to amend its risk-based capital standards in a manner consistent with
the Basle Supervisors' Committee's proposed revision to the Basle Accord. The FDIC's proposed amendments would
allow banks to net the positive and negative market values of interest and exchange rate contracts subject to a qualifying,
legally enforceable bilateral netting contract to calculate one current exposure for that netting contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC's proposed amendments would add provisions to its standards setting forth criteria for a qualifying bilateral
netting contract and an explanation of how the credit equivalent amount should be calculated for such contracts.
The risk-based capital treatment of an individual contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral netting
contract would remain unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For interest and exchange rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract under the proposed
standards, the credit equivalent amount would equal the sum of (i) the current exposure of the netting contract and
(ii) the sum of the add-ons for all individual contracts subject to the netting contract. (As with all contracts, mark-to-market
values for netted contracts would be measured in dollars, regardless of the currency specified in the contract.)
The current exposure of the bilateral netting contract would be determined by adding together all positive and negative
mark-to-market values of the individual contracts subject to the bilateral netting contract.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The current exposure would equal the sum of the market values if that sum is positive, or zero if the sum of the market
values is zero or negative. The potential future exposure (add-on) for each individual contract subject to the bilateral
netting contract would be calculated in the same manner as for non-netted contracts. These individual potential
future exposures would then be added together to arrive at one total add-on amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For regulatory capital purposes, the FDIC would expect that institutions would normally calculate the current exposure
of a bilateral netting contract by consistently including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
all 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
contracts covered by that netting contract. In the event a netting contract covers transactions that are normally
excluded from the risk-based ratio calculation_for example, exchange rate contracts with an original maturity
of fourteen calendar days or less or instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin_institutions
may elect to consistently either include or exclude all mark-to-market values of such transactions when determining
net current exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments provide that a bank may net, for risk-based capital purposes, interest and exchange rate
contracts only under a written bilateral netting contract that creates a single legal obligation covering all included
individual rate contracts and that does not contain a walkaway clause. In addition, if a counterparty fails to perform
due to default, insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar circumstances, the bank must have a claim to receive
a payment, or an obligation to make a payment, for only the net amount of the sum of the positive and negative market values
on included individual contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC's proposal requires that a bank obtain a written and reasoned legal opinion(s), representing that an organization's
claim or obligation, in the event of a legal challenge, including one resulting from a failure to perform due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to default, insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar circumstances, would be found by the relevant court and administrative
authorities to be the net sum of all positive and negative market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values of contracts included in the bilateral netting contract.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The legal opinion normally would cover (i) the law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered or the
equivalent location in the case of noncorporate entities and, if a branch of the counterparty is involved, the law
of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located; (ii) the law that governs the individual contracts covered by the
bilateral netting contract; and (iii) the law that governs the netting contract. The multiple jurisdiction requirement
is designed to ensure that the netting contract would be upheld in any jurisdiction where the contract would likely
be enforced or whose law would likely be applied in an enforcement action, as well as the jurisdiction where the counterparty's
assets reside.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued Interpretation No. 39 (FIN 39) relating to the ``Offsetting
of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts.'' FIN 39 generally provides that assets and liabilities meeting specified
criteria may be netted under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, FIN 39 does not specifically
require a written and reasoned legal opinion regarding the enforceability of the netting contract in bankruptcy
and other circumstances. Therefore, under this proposal a bank might be able to net certain contracts in accordance
with FIN 39 for GAAP reporting purposes, but not be able to net those contracts for risk-based capital purposes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A legal opinion could be prepared by either an outside law firm or in-house counsel. If a bank obtained an opinion on
the enforceability of a bilateral netting contract that covered a variety of underlying contracts, it generally
would not need a legal opinion for each individual underlying contract that is subject to the netting contract, so
long as the individual underlying contracts were of the type contemplated by the legal opinion covering the netting
contract.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The complexity of the legal opinions will vary according to the extent and nature of the bank's involvement in rate
contracts. For instance, a bank that is active in the international financial markets may need opinions covering
multiple foreign jurisdictions as well as domestic law. The FDIC expects that in many cases a legal opinion will focus
on whether a contractual choice of law would be recognized in the event of default, insolvency, bankruptcy or similar
circumstances in a particular jurisdiction rather than whether the jurisdiction recognizes netting. For example,
a U.S. institution might engage in interest rate swaps with a non-U.S. institution under a netting contract that includes
a provision that the contract will be governed by U.S. law. In this case the U.S. institution should obtain a legal opinion
as to whether the netting would be upheld in the U.S. and whether the foreign courts would honor the choice of U.S. law
in default or in an insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a bank that engages solely in domestic rate contracts, the process of obtaining a legal opinion may be much simpler.
For example, for an institution that is an end-user of a relatively small volume of domestic rate contracts, the standard
contracts used by the dealer bank may already have been subject to the mandated legal review. In this case the end-user
institution may obtain a copy of the opinion covering the standard dealer contracts, supported by the bank's own legal
opinion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments require a bank to establish procedures to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting
contracts are kept under review in the light of possible changes in relevant law. This review would apply to any conditions
that, according to the required legal opinions, are a prerequisite for the enforceability of the netting contract,
as well as to any adverse changes in the law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with all of the provisions of the risk-based capital standards, a bank must maintain in its files documentation
adequate to support any particular risk-based capital treatment. In the case of a bilateral netting contract, a bank
must maintain in its files documentation adequate to support the bilateral netting contract. In particular, this
documentation should demonstrate that the bilateral netting contract would be honored in all relevant jurisdictions
as set forth in this rule. Typically, these documents would include a copy of the bilateral netting contract, legal
opinions and any related English translations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC would have the discretion to disqualify any or all contracts from netting treatment for risk-based capital
purposes if the bilateral netting contract, individual contracts, or associated legal opinions do not meet the requirements
set out in the applicable standards. In the event of such a disqualification, the affected individual contracts subject
to the bilateral netting contract would be treated as individual non-netted contracts under the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a general matter, relevant legal provisions for banks in the U.S. make it clear that netting contracts with close-out
provisions enable such organizations to setoff included individual transactions and reduce the obligations to
a single net amount in the event a counterparty fails to perform due to default, insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation
or similar circumstances. The FDIC notes that pursuant to section 11(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI
Act), 12 U.S.C. 1821(e), the FDIC, in its capacity as conservator or receiver of a failed insured depository institution,
may transfer all or none of a failed institution's qualified financial contracts (QFCs)

 with a given counterparty and its affiliates to an assuming insured depository institution. Such a transfer by the
FDIC as receiver, if accompanied by the statutorily mandated notice, overrides any contractual right the counterparty
might otherwise have to terminate, close-out, and net its contracts by reason of the appointment of the FDIC as receiver.
Further, the FDIC as conservator may, under section 11(e) of the FDI Act, enforce continued performance of QFCs without
transferring them, even if the contracts contain clauses that would otherwise enable the counterparty to treat them
as in default, and hence to terminate and net them, by reason of the appointment of a conservator.

The scope of this transfer power is established in the FDIC Statement of Policy on Qualified Financial Contracts adopted
December 12, 1989. The term QFC is defined in section 11(e)(8)(D)(i) of the FDI Act. It includes securities contracts,
commodity contracts, forward contracts, repurchase agreements, swap agreements, and any similar agreement that
the FDIC determines by regulation to be a QFC. Interest and exchange rate contracts, as specifically referred to in
the risk-based capital guidelines, are generally QFCs.

 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Fed), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and
the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) (collectively, the other banking agencies) either have published or are in
the process of publishing notices of proposed rulemaking amending their risk-based capital guidelines which are
similar to the FDIC's proposal. The other banking agencies are not addressing the scope of the FDIC's transfer and
enforcement powers under section 11 of the FDI Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC is of the opinion that its transfer and enforcement powers under the FDI Act are consistent with the netting
provisions of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Those provisions specifically sanction the enforceability
of bilateral netting contracts (12 U.S.C. 4403(a)); so do the FDI Act's QFC provisions (12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)(A)(iii),
(E)(iii)). The FDIC's transfer and enforcement powers, described in the text, are associated with its power to override
a different kind of contractual provision_the so-called ``ipso facto'' clauses that permit a counterparty to terminate
a contract by reason of the appointment of a receiver or conservator even if there has been no default in performance.
Although such clauses may activate netting clauses, they are not themselves specifically addressed in, or protected
by, the FDICIA netting provisions. Thus, there is no conflict of language between the FDI Act's QFC provisions and
the FDICIA netting provisions. Nor is there any inconsistency in the statutes' underlying policy. The policy of the
FDI Act's QFC provisions, like that of the FDICIA netting provisions, is to preserve a counterparty's net position:
If the FDIC does not transfer or enforce a counterparty's QFCs, then the contracts may be terminated and netted to the
extent provided by their terms; and if the contracts are transferred or enforced, then the netting provisions continue
in force as a part of the entire complex of contractual obligations. The transfer and enforcement provisions of the
FDI Act do no more than to preserve the continuity of contractual relationships in cases of receivership and conservatorship,
an effect that the FDIC believes to be consistent with the letter and spirit of the FDICIA netting provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that QFCs are transferred from a failed institution to a new depository institution, the amount of credit
risk the non-failed counterparty is exposed to remains the same. Thus, the netting provisions in the contracts may
be enforced against or by the assuming insured depository institution in the event of a subsequent default. Therefore,
the FDIC would not regard a netting contract as unenforceable, for risk-based capital purposes, simply because the
FDIC as receiver might transfer it within the limited circumstances prescribed in section 11(e) of the FDI Act. In
the case of QFCs enforced without transfer by the FDIC as conservator, the counterparty would continue to enjoy its
contractual rights to terminate and net such enforced contracts by reason of a default in performance (as distinct
from a contractually defined default by reason of appointment of a conservator). In this regard, the FDIC would not
regard a netting contract as unenforceable simply because the FDIC as conservator might enforce the underlying contracts
within the circumstances prescribed in section 11(e) of the FDI Act.

To facilitate the utilization of risk reducing bilateral netting contracts which will permit institutions to take
advantage of the new capital standards prescribed in this proposal, the FDIC has determined not to exercise any potential
power as a conservator selectively to enforce or to repudiate QFCs with the same counterparty that are subject to a
bilateral netting contract. The FDIC would not regard bilateral netting contracts as unenforceable solely by reason
of the apparent presence of such a power in section 11(e) of the FDI Act.

The FDIC's proposal provides that netting by novation arrangements would 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be grandfathered under the standards if such arrangements do not meet all of the requirements proposed for qualifying
bilateral netting contracts. Although netting by novation would continue to be recognized under the proposed standards,
institutions may not have the legal opinions or procedures in place that would be required by the proposed amendments.
The FDIC believes that holding all bilateral netting contracts to the same standards will promote certainty as to
the legal enforceability of the contracts and decrease the risks faced by counterparties in the event of a default.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The FDIC is seeking comment on all aspects of its proposed amendments to the risk-based capital standards. In addition,
the FDIC notes that under current risk-based capital standards for individual contracts, the degree to which collateral
is recognized in assigning the appropriate risk weight is based on the market value of the collateral in relation to
the credit equivalent amount of the rate contract. The FDIC is seeking comment on the nature of collateral arrangements
and the extent to which collateral might be recognized in bilateral netting contracts, particularly taking into
account legal implications of collateral arrangements (e.g., whether the collateral pledged for an individual
transaction would be available to cover the net counterparty exposure in the event of legal challenge) and procedural
difficulties in monitoring collateral levels.

The FDIC does not believe adoption of this proposal as a final rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small business entities (in this case, small banking organizations), in accord with the spirit and purposes
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). In this regard, the final rule would reduce certain regulatory
burdens on banking organizations as it would reduce the capital charge on certain transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Banks that enter into bilateral netting contracts must obtain a legal opinion(s) on the enforceability of those contracts
if they wish to net for purposes of calculating their capital ratio. A small institution may find it more burdensome
to obtain a legal opinion(s) than a large institution. A small institution, however, is more likely than a large institution
to enter into relatively uncomplicated transactions under standard bilateral netting contracts and may need only
to review a legal opinion that has already been obtained by its counterparties. The benefits to a small institution
of lower capital charges after netting will likely outweigh the burdens of obtaining the necessary legal opinions.

Netting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) For purposes of this appendix A, netting refers to the offsetting of positive and negative mark-to-market values
when determining a current exposure to be used in the calculation of a credit equivalent amount. Any legally enforceable
form of bilateral netting of rate contracts is recognized for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount
provided that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The netting is accomplished under a written netting contract that creates a single legal obligation, covering
all included individual contracts, with the effect that the bank would have a claim or obligation to receive or pay,
respectively, only the net amount of the sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values on included individual
contracts in the event that a counterparty, or a counterparty to whom the contract has been validly assigned, fails
to perform due to any of the following events: default, bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The bank obtains a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) representing that in the event of a legal challenge, including
one resulting from a failure to perform due to default, insolvency, bankruptcy or similar circumstances, the relevant
court and administrative authorities would find the bank's exposure to be such a net amount under:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) the law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate
entities and, if a branch of the counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch
is located;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the law that governs the individual contracts covered by the netting contract; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) the law that governs the netting contract.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) The bank establishes and maintains procedures to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting contracts
are kept under review in the light of possible changes in relevant law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The bank maintains in its files documentation adequate to support the netting of rate contracts, including a copy
of the bilateral netting contract and necessary legal opinions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A contract containing a walkaway clause is not eligible for netting for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent
amount.

For purposes of this section, a walkaway clause means a provision in a netting contract that permits a non-defaulting
counterparty to make lower payments than it would make otherwise under the contract, or no payment at all, to a defaulter
or to the estate of a defaulter, even if a defaulter or the estate of a defaulter is a net creditor under the contract.

(3) By netting individual contracts for the purpose of calculating its credit equivalent amount, a bank represents
that it has met the requirements of this appendix A and all the appropriate documents are in the bank's files and available
for inspection by the FDIC. Upon determination by the FDIC that a bank's files are inadequate or that a netting contract
may not be legally enforceable under any one of the bodies of law described in paragraphs (b)(i) through (iii) of this
section, underlying individual contracts may be treated as though they were not subject to the netting contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The credit equivalent amount of rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract is
calculated by adding (i) the current exposure of the netting contract and (ii) the sum of the estimates of the potential
future credit exposure on all individual contracts subject to the netting contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The current exposure of the netting contract is determined by summing all positive and negative mark-to-market
values of the individual transactions included in the netting contract. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values
is positive, then the current exposure of the netting contract is equal to that sum. If the net sum of the mark-to-market
values is zero or negative, then the current exposure of the netting contract is zero.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) For each individual contract included in the netting contract, the potential future credit exposure is estimated
in accordance with section II.E.1. of this appendix A.

Multiple contracts with the same counterparty may be netted for risk-based capital purposes pursuant to section
II.E.3. of this appendix.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains proposed Income Tax Regulations that would require a qualified business unit (QBU) using
the dollar approximate separate transactions method of accounting (DASTM) to change its functional currency when
the local currency ceases to be hyperinflationary. These regulations provide rules for taxpayers to determine when
a change from DASTM is required and provide guidance on required adjustments relating to the change in method.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 985 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986. The proposed regulations would require a qualified business unit that uses the dollar approximate
separate transactions method to change its functional currency and its method of accounting to the profit and loss
method when the QBU is no longer operating in an environment that has a hyperinflationary currency.

Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;1.985&hyph;1(b)(2)(ii)(E) provides that a QBU required to use the dollar as its functional currency
pursuant to &sect;1.985&hyph;1(b)(2) or a QBU that has elected to use the dollar as its functional currency pursuant
to &sect;1.985&hyph;2 must redetermine its functional currency if for three consecutive taxable years the currency
of the QBU's economic environment is not a hyperinflationary currency. The change in functional currency is treated
as made with the consent of the Commissioner, and the adjustments required under &sect;1.985&hyph;5 must be made
in connection with the change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IRS believes it appropriate to require a QBU that is no longer operating in a hyperinflationary environment to
stop using the dollar to compute its income or loss or earnings and profits because of the general preference expressed
in section 985(b) to use the currency of the QBU's economic environment for this purpose. A three year measurement
period for determining non-hyperinflationary status was thought desirable to avoid frequent changes in functional
currency for QBUs operating in borderline hyperinflationary environments. Comments are requested as to whether
the three year period is appropriate.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Park Service is proposing a rule designed to protect the coral reefs and turtle grass beds in Virgin Islands
National Park. The proposed rule will address allowable boat mooring practices in the park, and a public hearing will
be conducted to provide an opportunity for interested parties to comment on the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule will prohibit vessels longer than 210 feet from anchoring anywhere within the park's boundaries;
restrict vessels between 125 and 210 feet in length to anchoring only in Francis Bay in water depths greater than 30
feet; prohibit any boats from anchoring in Salt Pond and Reef Bay on the park's southern shores. Boats 55 feet in length
or less will be allowed to tie up to moorings that will be provided in those areas. Only one boat will be allowed to tie
up at each mooring, and the use of anchors while attached to the mooring will be prohibited.

Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In a prior Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this docket 58 FR 53169, October 14, 1993, the Commission requested
comment on whether it should establish a general cap on the amount of commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) spectrum
for which an entity may be licensed in a particular geographic market. The purpose of that proposal is to ensure that
no CMRS provider will exert market power by controlling large amounts of spectrum in a given geographic market. Additionally,
the Spectrum Cap Notice sought comment on rules for administering a spectrum cap, if the Commission adopted a spectrum
aggregation limit. The Spectrum Cap Notice invited comments on whether the Commission should apply personal communications
services (PCS) spectrum aggregation and cellular-PCS cross ownership attribution standards, adopted in the Broadband
PCS Order, to a general CMRS spectrum cap.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On June 13, 1994, the Commisson released an Order reconsidering and clarifying the rules for broadband PCS. The
Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order retained certain limitations on the amount of PCS spectrum that can be obtained
in any geographic service area. Generally, an entity may acquire attributable interests in a maximum of 40 MHz of licensed
broadband PCS spectrum. Parties with attributable cellular interests, however, may obtain only 10 MHz of licensed
broadband PCS spectrum if the population in the cellular service area overlaps 10 percent of the population in the
relevant PCS market. In addition, after January 1, 2000, entities with attributable cellular interests may acquire
an additional 5 MHz of broadband PCS spectrum, for a total of 15 MHz of PCS spectrum in their cellular service areas.
The Broadband PCS Reconsideration Order also specified certain interests that the Commission would consider attributable
interests in order to determine the maximum amount of PCS spectrum for which an entity may be licensed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On June 29, 1994, the Commission adopted an Order establishing competitive bidding procedures for broadband PCS.
The Commission adopted a ``Competitive Opportunity Plan'' in the Broadband PCS Auction Rules Order, under which
``entrepreneurs' blocks'' are established as a means of fulfilling the statutory mandate to ensure that businesses
owned by minorities or women (or both), small businesses, and rural telephone companies are provided with full opportunities
to participate in providing broadband PCS services. The Competitive Opportunity Plan, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
establishes installment payment plans for applicants eligible for entrepreneurs' block licenses, and also establishes
a system of bidding credits for small businesses and businesses owned by minorities or women (or both).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The purposes of this Second Further Notice is to explore whether the Commission should consider additional non-equity
relationships to be attributable interests for purposes of applying the 40 MHz limitation on PCS spectrum, the PCS-cellular
cross-ownership rules, or a more general CMRS spectrum cap. In addition, we seek comment regarding whether any attribution
rules we adopt in this proceeding should apply differently depending on whether the applicant or licensee involved
is a designated entity. We also seek comment regarding how much non-equity relationships should be construed in the
context of determining whether the designated entity has de facto and de jure control of the licensee. Finally, commenters
should address how such relationships in the designated entity context balance the need to allow designated entities
to attract needed expertise, capital and infrastructure while avoiding the creation of fronts or shams.

5. One of the purposes of this proceeding is to examine resale agreements, management contracts, joint marketing
agreements, and other similar arrangements for the purpose of determining whether these arrangements should be
treated as attributable interests in applying the PCS spectrum aggregation cap, the PCS-cellular cross-ownership
restrictions, or a general CMRS spectrum cap. We recognize at the outset that any agreement that confers on a party
other than the licensee de facto control over an FCC-licensed facility will be considered an attributable interest.
Therefore, commenters should address whether there are relationships, not included in the PCS attribution rules,
that do not rise to the level of control, but nonetheless should be considered attributable because these interests
may affect the incentive or ability of PCS and other CMRS licensees to compete vigorously in the marketplace, or because
they may affect the number of effective competing providers or the independence of pricing decisions by service providers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Management Agreements: We request comment on whether management agreements or similar arrangements that do not
confer de facto control on a party other than the licensee should be considered attributable interests. We are concerned,
for example, that a management agreement may permit the manager access to market sensitive information (e.g., business
plans, customer lists, product and service development, marketing strategies); if the manager is also a licensee
offering a competing service, access to this information might enable it to impede vigorous competition. We also
seek comment regarding the issue of whether such management agreements, although not amounting to de facto control,
may involve levels of integration between the managed licensee and the manager's company which have the effect of
reducing competitive choices in the marketplace or of creating a sham or front corporation to take advantage of designated
entity provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. By way of background, we note that we have established several criteria that we have determined to be probative with
regard to the issue of whether a licensee, through management agreements or other means, and in contravention of our
rules, has relinquished control of and responsibility for its licensed facilities. These criteria, first articulated
in Intermountain, include the following questions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Does the license have unfettered use of all facilities and equipment? If the licensee retains such use, this
will support a finding that the licensee has not relinquished control to a third party through a management agreement
or other arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Has the licensee relinquished control of daily operations? Retention of such control by the licensee contributes
to a finding that the licensee has not relinquished control over the licensed facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Does the licensee determine and carry out policy decisions, including the preparation and filing of applications
with the Commission? If it is demonstrated that the licensee has retained control of policy decisions, this serves
as another contributing factor in determining that the licensee has not relinquished control of its licensed facilities
to a third party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Is the licensee is charge of employment, supervision, and dismissal of personnel? Retention of control over
such personnel matters would tend to support a conclusion that the licensee has not relinquished control to a third
party through a management agreement or other arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Is the licensee in charge of the payment of financing obligations, including expenses arising out of operation
of the licensed facilities? If the licensee has retained responsibility for such expenses, such retention of control
will be taken into account in determining whether the licensee has relinquished control of its facilities to a third
party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Does the licensee receive monies and profits derived from operation of the licensed facilities? Again, the
role of the licensee with regard to receipt of profits and other monies is one of the determining factors with regard
to whether the licensee has relinquished control of its facilities to a third party through a management agreement
or other arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proceeding our purpose is to examine whether management agreements which do not involve any relinquishment
of control under the Intermountain test still should be deemed to confer attributable interests to the managing party
under the agreement. We seek comment on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In particular, commenters should address the following questions. First, could management agreements be structured
in such a way that the manager's access to the type of information described in the preceding paragraph would not necessarily
have any adverse effect on competition? Commenters should address the specific components of such management agreements,
and discuss how these components would protect against anti-competitive effects. Commenters also should address
whether examination of such management agreements would require an unreasonable expenditure of Commission staff
and other resources and whether there are effective alternatives to such a review procedure that would address our
concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Second, should a management agreement be treated as an attributable interest in all cases, including the PCS spectrum
aggregation cap, the PCS-cellular cross-ownership restrictions, and any overall CMRS spectrum aggregation cap
the Commission may establish in this docket? In addressing this question, commenters should explore any factors
and considerations that would support a conclusion that treatment of a management agreement as an attributable interest
would be necessary or appropriate in certain of these cases, but not in others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Third, if we conclude that management agreements or similar arrangements should be treated as attributable interests,
what administrative rules would be necessary to enforce such a rule? Would reporting requirements be necessary to
enable the Commission to record and monitor instances in which CMRS licensees enter into management agreements for
the operation of their systems? For example, in the SMR industry, some private radio licensees have entered into agreements
that permit a third party manager to use the system's entire capacity. Although we have reclassified interconnected
wide area SMRs as CMRS, SMRs licensed as of August 10, 1993 will continue to be regulated as PMRS during the transition
period and SMRs that are not interconnected will remain PMRS. We seek comment on how we should treat such arrangements
for purposes of attribution.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Finally, if we conclude that management agreements or similar arrangements should be treated as attributable
interests, how should our rules apply in the case of designated entities? Specifically, we seek comment regarding
the following issues: Are there policies or other considerations that would warrant applying management contract
attribution rules differently in the case of designated entities? Should management agreements be attributable
for purposes of application of the 10 percent cap relating to entrepreneurs' block licenses? Should management contracts
affect eligibility for provisions provided for designated entities?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Resale. Similarly, we request comment on whether any resale agreements should be considered an interest attributable
to a reseller in the context of a PCS spectrum aggregation cap, PCS-cellular cross-ownership restrictions, or a general
CMRS spectrum cap. The Commission has defined resale as an ``activity wherein one entity subscribes to the communications
services and facilities of another entity and then reoffers communications service to the public (with or without
`adding value') for profit.'' We have required cellular licensees to provide resale, except that a cellular licensee
may restrict resale by a facilities-based competitor after the competitor has been licensed for five years. We note
that resellers of commercial mobile radio services have been classified as CMRS providers, and they may offer services
that compete with other commercial mobile radio services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. In most instances, we are not concerned that a reseller could exercise effective control over the spectrum on which
it provides service or have the ability to reduce the amount of service provided over that spectrum because other resellers
could enter into such resale arrangements. Under these circumstances, we see no reason to attribute the spectrum
of the underlying service provider to resellers for purposes of spectrum caps. Some parties, however, have expressed
concern that resale agreements may be used to circumvent the spectrum caps. In the context of common carrier regulation,
it seems unlikely that any resale agreement short of a transfer of control could reduce the quantity of service available
to the public. As a result, we currently do not think that resale agreements should be considered attributable interests,
but we invite comments from parties that believe there are competitive concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Joint Marketing Agreements. We also request comment on whether joint marketing agreements should constitute
an attributable interest in the contest of a PCS spectrum aggregation cap, PCS-cellular cross-ownership restrictions,
or a general CMRS spectrum cap. Under a joint marketing agreement, two or more CMRS providers would pool their resources
to market their services to consumers. One aspect of this joint venture may be to market the services of various CMRS
providers under a common name. We believe that such joint ventures may be beneficial to both licensees and consumers
because of the savings that could be realized by pooling resources for advertising and direct sales. These savings
could then be passed on to the consumer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
15. The Commission previously examined whether to limit various joint ventures in the context of our broadcast ownership
rules. In that context, the Commission examined joint advertising sales, shared technical facilities, and joint
programming arrangements (or ``time brokerage''). We noted that such joint ventures are not precluded by any Commission
rule or policy so long as the Commission's ownership rules are not violated and the participating licensees maintain
ultimate control over their facilities. The Commission did not impose any additional restrictions on operational
joint venture arrangements, but noted that all broadcast licensees are subject to compliance with the antitrust
laws and maintenance of editorial control. The Commission, however, did limit time brokerage arrangements in the
same local market so that:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Where an individual or entity owns or has an attributable interest in one or more stations in a market, time brokerage
of any other station in that market form more than 15 percent of the brokered station's broadcast hours per week will
result in counting the brokered station toward the brokering licensee's permissible ownership totals under the
revised local ownership rules.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
16. As explained in Radio Ownership Rules, our rules or policies do not prohibit joint marketing ventures so long as
a licensee maintains 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control over the licensed facilities and complies with the antitrust laws. In the context of CMRS or PCS joint ventures,
we need not concern ourselves with programming diversity because CMRS providers are, by definition, common carriers
and have no control over content. We believe that there may be benefits to consumers from these joint marketing ventures.
We are concerned, however, that such arrangements may provide competitors access to information, or have other anticompetitive
effects, that could impede vigorous competition. Therefore, commenters should address whether a licensee who enters
into a joint marketing venture with one or more licensee whose geographic market area have an overlap of 10 percent
of the population should have the interest of the other joint venture licensees attributed to it for purposes of the
PCS aggregations limits, the cellular-PCS cost-ownership rules, or a general CMRS spectrum cap. In addition, if
the Commission finds such arrangements to be attributable interests, commenters should address whether we should
adopt different rules relating to designated entities.

A. Reason for Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule making proceeding was initiated to seek comment with regard to whether management agreements and resale
arrangements should be treated as attributable interests for purposes of application of the Commission's rules
relating to (1) the personal communications service (PCS) spectrum aggregation cap; (2) the PCS-cellular cross-owner-ship
restrictions; (3) any overall commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) spectrum aggregation cap the Commission may
establish in this docket; and (4) control of a designated entity.

F. Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many small entities could be affected by the proposals contained in the Further Notice. Dependent on the final resolution
of the issues, regulations affecting the licensing, recordkeeping, and reporting obligations of numerous mobile
services providers may be changed. The full extent of these changes cannot be predicted until various other issues
raised in the proceeding (e.g., whether a CMRS spectrum cap will be established by the Commission) have been resolved.
After evaluating the comments filed in response to the Further Notice the Commission will examine further the impact
of all rule changes on small entities and set forth its findings in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.

The Commission requests comments on a petition filed by Skip Marrow proposing the allotment of Channel 271A at Elma,
Washington, as that community's first local aural transmission service. Channel 271A can be allotted to Elma in compliance
with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements without the imposition of a site restriction at
the petitioner's requested site. The coordinates for Channel 271A at Elma are North Latitude 47&hyph;00&hyph;13
and West Longitude 123&hyph;24&hyph;27. Since Elma located within 320 kilometers (200 miles) of the U.S.-Canadian

The Commission requests comments on a petition filed by Iowa Great Lakes Broadcasting Company, Inc., seeking the
substitution of Channel 285C2 for Channel 285A at Spencer, IA, and the modification of Station KIGL(FM)'s license
to specify operation on the higher class channel. To accommodate the allotment of Channel 285C2 at Spencer, Iowa Great
Lakes Broadcasting Company, Inc., also requests the substitution of Channel 268A for Channel 284A at St. James, MN,
the modification of Station KXAX's license accordingly, and the deletion of unoccupied and unapplied-for Channel
284A at Sac City, IA. Channel 285C2 can be allotted to Spencer with a site restriction of 11.2 kilometers (6.9 miles)
northwest, at coordinates 43&hyph;14&hyph;32 North Latitude and 95&hyph;09&hyph;19 West Longitude, to accommodate
petitioner's desired transmitter site and avoid short-spacings to Stations KLMJ, Channel 285A, Hampton, IA, KKLS&hyph;FM,
Channel 284C1, Sioux Falls, SD, KARL, Channel 286C2, Tracy, MN, and KIWA&hyph;FM, Channel 287C2, Sheldon, IA. Channel

), requires that for any petition to revise the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants, a finding be
made within 12 months of the date of receipt of the petition on whether the petitioned action is (i) not warranted, (ii)
warranted, or (iii) warranted but precluded by the efforts to revise the lists and expeditious progress is being made
in listing and delisting species. Notice of the finding is to be published promptly it the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Information contained in this notice is a summary of the information in the 12-month finding, which is the Fish and
Wildlife Service's (Service) decision document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A petition dated October 2, 1991, was received by the Service from the Biodiversity Legal Foundation and George Wuerthner
on October 9, 1991. The petition request that the ``fluvial Arctic grayling'' be listed as an endangered species throughout
its historic range in the conterminous United States. Additionally, the petitioners requested that critical habitat
be designated. The petitioners stated that the decline of the Fluvial Arctic grayling is a result of many factors.
The primary causes cited by the petitioners were habitat degradation as a result of the effects of domestic livestock
grazing and stream diversions for irrigation, competition with nonnative trout species, and past overharvesting
by anglers. Additionally, the petition stated that much of the annual recruitment is lost in irrigation ditches.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 4975) found that the petitioners provided substantial information indicating that listing the fluvial population
of the Arctic grayling of the upper Missouri River, in Montana and northwestern Wyoming, may be warranted. The notice
also indicated that the Fluvial Arctic grayling population in Michigan is extinct, thus there was not substantial
information to indicate that listing that population may be warranted. Concurrent with publishing notice of the
90-day finding in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All Arctic grayling in North America belong to a single species, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Thymallus arcticus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (family Salmonidae). Within North America, Arctic grayling are distributed throughout Alaska and across Canada
to the Hudson Bay. Additionally, two geographically isolated populations of Arctic grayling occurred outside of
Canada and Alaska in the contiguous United States, apparently as glacial relicts (Vincent 1962). One of these populations
was found in Michigan and the other in the drainage of the upper Missouri River in Montana and extreme northwestern
Wyoming (Scott and Crossman 1973). The upper Missouri River drainage population was the subject of the Service's
finding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The validity of subspecific distinctions for Arctic grayling has not been proven (Scott and Crossman 1973). A status
review was first initiated for the ``Montana Arctic grayling'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T. a. montanus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), as the fluvial Arctic grayling of the upper Missouri River is sometimes known, by a notice of review published December
30, 1982 (47 FR 58454). However, this subspecific designation is not widely accepted (Kaya 1990).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The native Arctic grayling populations of the upper Missouri River were predominantly fluvial (Vincent 1962). Fluvial
fishes are those that are permanently stream-dwelling. Adfluvial (also described as lacustrine) fish are those
that spend most of their lives in lakes except that they spawn in streams. The only indigenous adfluvial Arctic grayling
in the upper Missouri River basin are thought to be those in Red Rock Lakes and, perhaps, Elk Lake (Vincent 1962, Kaya
1990).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because fluvial Arctic grayling are adapted to life-long residency in stream environments, they are believed to
be behaviorally distinct from adfluvial grayling. The adfluvial Arctic grayling was not under consideration in
the Service's finding as it is believed to be a distinct population from the fluvial Arctic grayling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, in the upper Missouri River drainage the fluvial Arctic grayling was widely but irregularly distributed
and locally abundant above the Great Falls in Montana. Varley and Schullery (1983) estimate that Arctic grayling
of the upper Missouri River drainage presently occur in 8 percent or less of their historic range. Kaya (1992) estimates
that the remaining upper Missouri distribution of fluvial Arctic grayling in 80 to 130 km (50 to 80 miles) of the upper
Big Hole River may represent 4 to 5 percent of the historic range of fluvial Arctic grayling in Montana. Kaya (1992)
arrived at this estimate by using available information to conclude that, historically, grayling may have inhabited
approximately 2,000 km (1,250 miles) of streams in the upper Missouri River basin until early in this century.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only confirmed, self-sustaining remnant of the indigenous upper Missouri River fluvial Arctic grayling population
exists in the Big Hole River and the lower reaches of its tributaries in Beaverhead, Deer Lodge, and Silver Bow Counties
in Montana (Liknes and Gould 1987, Shepard and Oswald 1989, Kaya 1990, Kaya 1992). Fluvial Arctic grayling are concentrated
in the upper Big Hole River above the Divide dam, although they have been documented down to the mouth (Liknes and Gould
1987, Shepard and Oswald 1989). The numbers of grayling in the Big Hole River have been in decline; recent estimates
for a section of the Big Hole with the highest grayling densities were 69 grayling per km (111 per mile) in 1983, decreasing
to 14 per km (22 per mile) in 1989. The population appears to have stabilized in the past 3 years at approximately 20 grayling
per km (32 per mile) (Kaya 1990; Byorth 1991, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional remnant of the fluvial Arctic grayling population of the upper Missouri River drainage may occur in
and around Ennis Reservoir on the Madison River in Madison County, Montana. Until the Service receives conclusive
information to the contrary, the Arctic grayling of Ennis Reservoir/Madison River will be considered a remnant of
the upper Missouri River fluvial Arctic grayling population.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A factor complicating identification of the upper Missouri River fluvial Arctic grayling population is the extensive
hatchery propagation and transplantation of Arctic grayling stocks that has occurred in lakes and rivers throughout
Montana and elsewhere (Lee et al. 1980, Everett 1986). The Service does not regard the introduced, lake-dwelling
graying to be part of the indigenous upper Missouri River fluvial Arctic grayling population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Introduced Arctic grayling that display partially fluvial characteristics reside in Sunnyslope Irrigation Canal
in Teton County, Montana. The Service does not consider the Sunnyslope Canal Arctic grayling to be a remnant of the
native upper Missouri River fluvial Arctic grayling population.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following information is a summary and discussion of the five factors or listing criteria as set forth in Section
4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement
the listing provisions of the Act and their applicability to the current status of the fluvial population of the Arctic
grayling.

A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A substantial portion of the historic range of the fluvial Arctic grayling has been altered by the extensive construction
of dams and reservoirs that have created barriers obstructing migrations to spawning, wintering or feeding areas;
inundating grayling habitat; and altering the hydrology of river systems (Vincent 1962, Kaya 1990). In the upper
Missouri River drainage, the dominant land use has become agriculture-related (Vincent 1962). The major impact
from these activities on Arctic grayling habitat is by the diversion of water for irrigation, which reduces available
instream habitat for grayling. This results in stranding of incubating eggs or young fish, thus increasing predation
on young because they are concentrated in the remaining water, reducing food availability, increasing water temperatures
(Kaya 1990), decreasing survival of young grayling (Shepard and Oswald 1989), and increasing mortality of trapped
fish when diversions are shut down (Shepard and Oswald 1989, Streu 1990). Increased sedimentation from agricultural
run-off is also a problem (Vincent 1962, Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks 1989, Shepard and Oswald 1989).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since Arctic grayling are easily caught by anglers, historical exploitation likely contributed to past declines
or local extirpations of the grayling population in the upper Missouri River drainage (Vincent 1962, Kaya 1990).
A commercial fishery for Arctic grayling existed on the upper Missouri River (Vincent 1962). Catch-and-release
fishing regulations are currently in effect on the Big Hole in order to reduce mortality from recreational fishing
(Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks 1989).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although data has been inconclusive, Arctic grayling interactions, including competition and predation, with
nonnative trout species are thought to be factors contributing to the decline of Arctic grayling (Vincent 1962, Kaya
1990, 1992).

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the Big Hole River is managed to produce abundant, large, nonnative trout (Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife
and Parks 1989). Other than catch and release regulations, grayling are a management priority only in the one reach
in which they are concentrated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Vincent (1962) suggested that a gradual climatic change could have been a factor in the decline of Arctic grayling
populations. Since the latter part of the 1980's, drought conditions have been prevalent throughout the upper Missouri
River drainage. During this same period, densities of Arctic grayling and other fishes in the Big Hole River have declined
(Oswald 1990; Byorth 1991; C. Hunter, Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992). Drought exacerbates the impacts of others factors affecting Arctic grayling. Decreased fish population
densities appear to be a natural response to low water flows which restrict the amount of fish habitat that is available,
particularly during critical spawning and rearing periods (C. Hunter, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires the Service to make determinations regarding listing solely on the basis of the best scientific and
commercial data available after conducting a review of the status of the species and after taking into account those
efforts being made by States and others to protect the species. Additionally, the Act allows the Service to list distinct
population segments of vertebrate fish and wildlife as threatened or endangered. The fluvial form of the Arctic grayling
in the upper Missouri River drainage is geographically isolated from other fluvial grayling populations and is behaviorally
distinct from adfluvial grayling. For these reasons, the Service believes the fluvial form of the Arctic grayling
in the upper Missouri River drainage is a distinct population segment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the fluvial Arctic grayling faces threats primarily from a reduction in historical range, decrease
in available habitat as a result of dewatering within streams, potential competition or predation by nonnative fish,
and habitat degradation. The Service finds that listing of the fluvial population of the Arctic grayling is warranted
but precluded by work on other species having a higher priority for listing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(b) of the Act states that petitioned actions may be found to be warranted but precluded by other listing actions
when it is found that the Service is making expeditious progress in revising the lists. Expeditious progress in listing
endangered and threatened species is being made and is reported annually in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Furthermore, on September 21, 1983, (48 FR 43098), the Service published a system for prioritizing species for listing.
This system considers 3 factors in assigning species numerical listing priorities on a scale of 1 to 12 (with number
1 as the highest priority). The three factors are magnitude of threat, immediacy of threat, and taxonomic distinctiveness.
Earlier the service had assigned a listing priority of 3 to the fluvial Arctic grayling because the Service considered
the magnitude of threat to be high, the immediacy of threat to be imminent, and the taxonomic distinctiveness to be
a vertebrate population. The Service is now changing the magnitude of threat to moderate, primarily as a result of
the cooperative efforts that have been initiated among private organizations and individuals, universities, and
State and Federal Agencies to restore the fluvial Arctic grayling population in the upper Missouri River drainage
(C. Hunter, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993). Changing the magnitude of threat to moderate results in a change of the listing priority from 3 to 9. The cooperative
efforts include, but are not limited to, the efforts discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is a member of the Workgroup (Workgroup) and a party to a Memorandum of Understanding entered into in 1991
with Federal, State, and private entities whose purpose is to conserve and restore fluvial Arctic grayling. The Workgroup
is near completion of a final restoration plan for the fluvial Arctic grayling of the upper Missouri River.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the U.S. Forest Service have begun working with landowners
to reduce water and habitat-related threats to the population. Since 1992, irrigators in the Big Hole have voluntarily
reduced their water withdrawals in order to sustain flows in the river system. Many water users have modified their
diversions to reduce the incidence of grayling becoming entrapped in ditches.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks has intensified its annual monitoring of the Big Hole River grayling
population since 1991. Recent habitat improvement projects have taken place on the Big Hole with the cooperation
and assistance of private landowners. In 1992, a channel of the Big Hole River was reopened, restoring substantial
historical grayling habitat. Fishing regulations have been introduced to protect grayling from harvest. Results
from a hooking mortality study conducted in 1992 and 1993 indicate that mortality of released grayling is low. Field
research, begun in 1993, is underway to clarify the threat of nonnative fish to fluvial grayling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to better understand grayling habitat requirements, the U.S. Geological Survey collected physical, chemical,
and biological measurements in segments of the Big Hole River in 1993. The results are now being finalized. The Service's
Fish Technology Center (Center) in Bozeman, Montana, completed a study in 1993 to identify water temperatures that
may be limiting for grayling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1989, the Center has managed and maintained fluvial grayling broodstock. Protocols have been established
for the development and use of a genetic reserve of Big Hole River grayling. The development of this genetic reserve
is an integral component in fluvial grayling restoration because this stock will be used for the reestablishment
of grayling in other drainages and will provide a ``safety net'' in case of a catastrophic loss of fluvial grayling
in the Big Hole River.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, sites within the upper Missouri River drainage were evaluated to identify those with the best potential for
successful fluvial grayling reestablishment. Progeny of Arctic grayling from the Big Hole River were reintroduced
into three rivers within their historic range and additional reintroductions are planned to reestablish viable
stocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the petition, accompanying documents, research findings, and literature cited; the Service concludes
that the petition requesting that the fluvial population of the Arctic grayling be listed as an endangered species
is warranted but precluded by other higher priority listing actions. After arriving at the warranted but precluded
finding, the Service recommended that the fluvial Arctic grayling be given a listing priority of 9 because the magnitude
of threats have been moderated as a result of ongoing cooperative conservation actions. The petitioners also requested
that critical habitat be designated. In the future if the warranted but precluded finding for the fluvial population
of Arctic grayling in the upper Missouri River drainage is changed to warranted, then the designation of critical
habitat would be addressed in the subsequent proposed rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention is proposing revisions to the existing Regulation, codified
at 28 CFR Part 31, and inviting public comment on the proposed changes. The proposed changes in the regulatory text
accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) continue the authority citation for the regulation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) revise &sect;31.3 to establish a mandatory deadline for the submission of State Formula Grant applications;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) revise &sect;31.102 to provide that the State agency must, at a minimum, assign one full-time Juvenile Justice
Specialist to manage the Formula Grants Program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) revise &sect;31.301 to provide for statutory changes in the base allocation for States and Territories; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) revise &sect;31.303(e)(3) to modify the requirements for a facility located within the same building or on the
same grounds as an adult jail or lockup to qualify as a separate juvenile detention facility; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) delete &sect;31.303(c)(3) and (e)(4) related to substantial compliance with the deinstitutionalization of
status offenders (DSO) and jail and lockup removal requirements respectively, and section 31.303(d)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to progress toward compliance with the separation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) revise &sect;31.303(d)(1) to provide for statutorily required enhanced separation requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) revise &sect;31.303(f)(3)(iv) to provide that a status offender alleged or found in a judicial hearing to have
violated a valid court order may be held in a secure juvenile detention or correctional facility and not in an adult
jail or lockup. This proposed revision, based on the 1992 Amendments, is effective for, and must be reflected in, State
monitoring reports due by December 31, 1994, and subsequent monitoring reports; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) revise &sect;31.303(f)(3) to require that status offenders receive the full due process protections guaranteed
by the Constitution prior to the issuance of a court order regulating future behavior, and that prior to a secure dispositional
placement of a status offender found to have violated a valid court order, the court must review and consider a report
on possible dispositional alternatives for the youth, the report to be prepared by a public agency or organization
other than a court or law enforcement agency;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(10) revise &sect;31.303(f)(4) to provide for expansion of the non-MSA exception to jail and lockup removal to address
adverse weather and distance/lack of ground transportation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) revise &sect;31.303 (f)(5) to require that States must, in completing their annual monitoring report, report
as violations of the section 223(a)(12)(A) deinstitutionalization requirement the number of status offenders
(including those status offenders accused of violating a valid court order) and nonoffenders held in secure custody
in an adult jail or lockup for any length of time. This proposed policy-based revision is effective for, and must be
reflected in, State monitoring reports due by December 31, 1995, and subsequent monitoring reports; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) delete &sect;31.303(f)(6)(iii)(A) related to substantial compliance with the jail and lockup removal requirement
and redesignate subsequent paragraphs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) revise &sect;31.303(f)(6)(iii)(C), as redesignated, to allow States that have reduced the number of status
and nonoffenders securely detained or confined in jails and lockups to less than 9 per 100,000 juvenile population
in the State, and can demonstrate meaningful progress in removing juvenile criminal-type offenders, to qualify
for a waiver of termination for annual fund allocations through Fiscal Year 1993, when full compliance with the jail
and lockup removal requirement has not been achieved. This section is also revised to require that a State seeking
a waiver of termination demonstrate an ``unequivocal'' commitment to achieving full compliance;

by 25% for each such failure;

Application Deadline

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 31.1 currently requires that Formula Grant applications and related plans or plan updates for each fiscal
year should be submitted to OJJDP by August 1st (60 days prior to the beginning of the fiscal year) or within 60 days after
States are officially notified of each fiscal year's Formula Grants Program allocation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of States have submitted applications sufficiently late in recent fiscal years to impede orderly and timely
application processing by OJJDP. This has resulted in an increased number of special conditions and a need for time
consuming follow-up by State Relations and Assistance Division staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submission requirement would be changed to require that Fiscal Year 1995 applications and all subsequent applications
shall be submitted to OJJDP no later than March 31 of the fiscal year for which the funds were allocated. This submission
date would allow OJJDP adequate time to conduct a full review of each State's plan or plan update, give States the opportunity
to address any deficiencies in the application, plan or plan update, or budget prior to award, and assure complete
application processing and award of funds prior to the end of the fiscal year.

In addition to the current ``adequate staff'' requirement of &sect;31.102 for the State agency administering Formula
Grant funds, the Regulation is revised to provide that a participating State agency must, at a minimum, assign one
full-time Juvenile Justice Specialist to manage the Formula Grants Program. OJJDP's experience indicates that
the complexity of the Formula Grants program justifies the attention of at least one full-time Juvenile Justice Specialist
in each State to perform and oversee required planning and administration activities including: developing, announcing,
competing, packaging, awarding, evaluating, and overseeing subawards, developing programs to address disproportionate
minority confinement issues and provide for effective use of Indian tribe pass-through funds; providing for program
and project monitoring; playing a central role in preparing the three year program plan and annual plan update; providing
staff support to the State supervisory board and/or the State advisory group; and overseeing the reporting of State
progress in achieving and maintaining compliance with the deinstitutionalization, separation, adult jail and
lockup removal, and disproportionate minority confinement requirements.

Funding_Allocation to States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 222(a) provides for a ``floating minimum'' for the allocation of formula grants to States and Territories
that is tied to the total appropriation level for Title II in a given fiscal year. For Fiscal Year 1993, the total appropriation
for Title II of the JJDP Act (other than Parts D and E) was less than $75 million. As a result, the ``floating minimum''
formula grant allocation for any State was legislatively established at a minimum of $325,000 and a maximum of $400,000
for States, and $75,000 and $100,000 for Territories, with no State or Territory receiving less than its Fiscal Year
1992 allocation. The Congressionally stated purpose of this formula was to increase the funds available to the minimum
allocation States and Territories. In order to ensure that this Congressional intent is maximized, the Fiscal Year
1993 formula grant allocations held the non-minimum States and Territories at their Fiscal Year 1992 funding levels,
allocating the increased Fiscal Year 1993 formula grant funds to the minimum States and Territories on a prorata basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Fiscal Year 1994, the total appropriation for Title II (other than Part D) exceeds the $75 million threshold. Consequently,
the ``floating minimum'' formula grant allocation for any State in Fiscal Year 1994 is established at a minimum of
$400,000 and a maximum of $600,000. OJJDP proposes to implement the amended language in Section 222(a)(2)(B) to provide
for a minimum allocation of $600,000, based on fund availability: ``*&blank;*&blank;* not less than $400,000, or
such greater amount, up to $600,000, as is available to be allocated *&blank;*&blank;*'' All non-minimum States
will also receive an increased formula grant allocation in Fiscal Year 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed State formula grant allocations for Fiscal Years 1993 and 1994 have been provided to all States and Territories.
The precise procedure used by the budget staff of the Office of Justice Programs to calculate State formula grant allocations
is available upon request.

Collocated Juvenile and Adult Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act requires that juveniles be removed from adult jails and lockups. OJJDP policy No.
91&hyph;1401, July 16, 1991, sought to clarify the existing OJJDP regulatory requirements for establishing the
existence of a separate juvenile detention facility where such facility is located in the same building or on the same
grounds as an adult jail or lockup. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OJJDP's initial policy on collocated juvenile and adult facilities was established by an OJJDP ``Position Statement
on Minimum Requirements of Section 223(a)(14) of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, as amended,''
which was published as a Notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 17, 1984. Four criteria were established in that policy publication, each of which had to be met to ensure
the requisite separateness of juvenile and adult facilities. The criteria were subsequently incorporated into
the Formula Grants regulation the following year (See 50 FR 119, 25550&hyph;25561, June 20, 1985). The July 16, 1991
OJJDP policy reiterated each of the four criteria, and sought to clarify a number of specific implementation mechanisms
that would be acceptable to OJJDP while remaining within the parameters of each criterion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The clarifications in OJJDP Policy No. 91&hyph;1401 have been the subject of continued concern and controversy in
the juvenile justice community. In addition, the 1992 Amendments substantially revise one of the four criteria (separate
staff) for determining whether a separate juvenile detention facility exists. For these reasons, the Administrator
deems it essential to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on each of the four collocated facility
criteria.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In formulating the four criteria initially, and in providing additional policy clarification, OJJDP recognized
a need to distinguish an optimal system, where a juvenile detention center would never be collocated with an adult
jail or lockup, from a system where States can use collocated facilities that meet the regulatory requirements for
a separate facility by creating and maintaining an atmosphere that is appropriate and conducive to the care of alleged
juvenile criminal-type offenders who require a secure detention environment. Given the limited level of funds available
to States under the Formula Grants program, and the need to expend these funds to address a variety of priorities and
needs identified in the JJDP Act and State plans, OJJDP has sought to provide States with sufficient flexibility to
achieve and maintain compliance with JJDP Act mandates while, at the same time, addressing needed delinquency prevention
and other system improvement initiatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation clarifies the four criteria by providing that: (1) Total separation in spatial areas of juvenile
and adult facilities can be achieved by providing for no common use areas or by time-phasing common use areas, provided
that the arrangement precludes even haphazard or accidental contact between juvenile and adult residents and adult
facility staff at all times and provided that time-phasing of common use areas cannot extend to sleeping or living
areas. Under either approach to total separation, written operational plans, policies and procedures must be in
place to insure that the objective of total separation is achieved; (2) total separation in juvenile and adult program
activities requires the formulation of an independent and comprehensive operational plan for the juvenile facility
which provides a full range of separate program activities for juveniles. While program space, equipment and resources
may be shared by both juvenile and adult facility populations subject to the requirements of total separation in spatial
areas, the key feature of this policy is the express requirement that the juvenile population receive a full range
of services in circumstances where collocation of facilities is approved; (3) separate juvenile and adult staff_management,
security and direct care_is essential to the maintenance of an appropriate atmosphere for the care of juveniles in
detention. The regulation distinguishes between staff who routinely have day-to-day direct care responsibility
for juveniles and specialized service staff not normally in contact with detainees. For security and direct care
staff (including management), the 1992 Amendments require that these functions be vested in totally separate staff.
This requirement is designed to ensure that a facility's security and direct care staff are both well qualified to
serve, and appropriately focused on, the needs of the juvenile population while providing juvenile facility services;
(4) in States that have standards or licensing requirements for secure juvenile detention facilities, a collocated
facility must meet the standards (on the same basis as separate facilities) and be licensed as appropriate. The proposed
regulation establishes an express requirement that a responsible State authority must certify that State standards
and licensing requirements have been met and that the architectural configuration and operational procedures and
policies of the facility assure total separation between juvenile detention center and adult facility populations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OJJDP intends these clarifications to strengthen the four requirements for a separate facility and to establish
reliable parameters for States completing final steps to achieve and maintain full compliance with the jail and lockup
removal requirement. The regulatory language committing OJJDP to the ``rule of reason'' represents a further attempt
to place the collocated facility criteria in perspective. Finally, States are reminded of their oversight responsibility
to insure that the separate character of any collocated juvenile detention facility is fully maintained following
its classification as a separate juvenile detention facility. The 1992 Amendments require States to reassess the
separate staff criterion in all collocated facilities, including those classified as such by the State and concurred
with by OJJDP prior to the effective date of this proposed regulation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OJJDP's original policy on collocated facilities was designed to accommodate a small number of existing juvenile
detention facilities. However, several States have used the policy and regulation to create a network of collocated
juvenile detention facilities in rural areas as county or regional detention facilities in lieu of establishing
dedicated county or regional juvenile detention facilities. Consequently, and because OJJDP does not believe either
that building or establishing collocated facilities in urban areas can be justified or that States should rely upon
collocated facilities as a primary or long-term strategy for achieving and maintaining compliance with the jail
and lockup removal mandate in rural areas, OJJDP proposes to limit future approval of collocated facilities to those
that are outside a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA), are operational or planned such that a determination
of compliance with the criteria can be made, and have been determined by the State (with subsequent OJJDP concurrence)
to meet each of the four criteria, by December 31, 1994.

The proposed regulation deletes the ``substantial compliance criteria'' from &sect;31.303(c)(3) and (e)(4) of
the regulation. Pursuant to the 1992 Amendments, all eligible States and territories are required to be in full compliance
with the DSO and Jail and Lockup Removal requirements in order to be eligible for FY 1994 Formula Grant funds. Also,
States must demonstrate compliance with the enhanced Separation and Disproportionate Minority Confinement mandates
in order to be eligible for 1994 funds. Therefore, the regulatory provision recognizing ``progress'' toward compliance
with the Separation mandate is being deleted. Also, enhanced criteria and specific timelines would be established
for the Disproportionate Minority Confinement Mandate. OJJDP would use these criteria and timelines to determine
if States have demonstrated compliance with the Minority Overrepresentation Mandate.

Deinstitutionalization of Status Offenders

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Revisions are proposed to the valid court order exception and monitoring report requirements related to the deinstituionalization
of status offenders and nonoffenders requirement (DSO) [section 223(a)(12)(A)]. These changes are designed to
bring the DSO requirement in line with the section 223(a)(14) Jail and Lockup Removal requirement. Currently, the
regulatory DSO exceptions for valid court order violations [28 CFR 31.303(f)(3)] and the 24-hour monitoring report
exception for detention of status and nonoffender juveniles [28 CFR 31.303(f)(5)] do not prohibit the use of adult
jails and lockups for status offenders who violate a valid court order or for status or nonoffender juveniles held
in secure custody pursuant to the 24-hour monitoring exception. This anomaly, which resulted from the separate years
in which these requirements became law (1974 and 1980, respectively), is being addressed to reflect OJJDP's determination
that there are no longer any circumstances in which the secure custody of noncriminal juveniles in adult jails and
lockups can be justified or sanctioned. To the extent that inadvertent or isolated violations occur, or where violations
result from emergency situations, the de minimis criteria for full compliance should continue to provide sufficient
latitude to permit States to maintain full compliance with the DSO requirement. Monitoring information to reflect
these changes must be included in the State Monitoring Report due by December 31, 1995, and subsequent monitoring
reports.

The criteria for a waiver of termination when a State has failed to achieve full compliance, or full compliance with

in 1989. Section 223(c)(3) of the JJDP Act provided that a State's failure to achieve compliance with the jail and lockup
removal requirement ``*&blank;*&blank;* shall terminate any State's eligibility for funding unless the Administrator
waives the termination of the State's eligibility on the condition that the State agrees to expend all of the funds
to be received under this part by the State, [with specific exceptions] only to achieve compliance with subsection

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Removed all status and nonoffender juveniles from adult jails and lockups. Compliance with this standard requires
that the last submitted monitoring report demonstrate that no status offender (including those accused of or adjudicated
for violating a valid court order) or nonoffender juveniles were securely detained in adult jails or lockups for any
length of time; or, that all status offenders and nonoffenders securely detained in adult jails and lockups for any
length of time were held in violation of an enforceable state law and did not constitute a pattern or practice within
the state. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, several States have not been awarded their FY 1992 and/or FY 1993 funds because they cannot meet criterion
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) for receiving a waiver. While the numbers of status and nonoffenders are typically small, these States either lack
an enforceable State law which would prohibit any violations or the State has been unable to demonstrate that the violations
do not constitute a pattern or practice within the State. OJJDP does not believe that the practice of detaining status
or nonoffender juveniles in adult jails or lockups is acceptable or that States should in any way sanction or permit
such a practice. However, OJJDP also has to weigh the detriment that will occur if States which are close to achieving
full compliance are deprived of a significant means of obtaining that important goal through the application of criteria
that are inflexible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, OJJDP proposes to modify criterion (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to provide that States can meet the standard by demonstrating that the number of status offenders (including valid
court order violators) and nonoffenders securely detained in adult jails and lockups is less than the numerical de
minimis rate of 9 per 100,000 juvenile population in the State. This provision is balanced by the addition in criterion
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) of a requirement that the State demonstrate an

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
commitment,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
through appropriate executive or legislative action, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to achieving full compliance, and the proposed change in the monitoring exception for DSO to prohibit placing a status
or nonoffender juvenile in an adult jail or lockup for any length of time. The proposed revisions should provide these
few remaining States with a reasonable opportunity to achieve full compliance without a loss of Formula Grant Program
funds while, at the same time, reiterating the Congressional mandate that adult jails and lockups are inappropriate
places in which to securely detain children who have committed no criminal law violation.

to each State will not be less than $325,000, nor more than $400,000, provided that no State receives less than its allocation
for Fiscal Year 1992. The Territories will receive not less than $75,000 or more than $100,000. If the amount appropriated
for title II (other than Part D) is $75 million or more, the amount allocated for each State will be not less than $400,000,
nor more than $600,000, provided that Parts D and E have been funded in the full amounts authorized. For the Territories,
the amount remains at $100,000.

Pursuant to section 223(d), the OJJDP Administrator shall endeavor to make the fund allotment under section 222(a),
of a State which chooses not to participate or loses its eligibility to participate in the formula grant program, directly
available to local public and private nonprofit agencies within the nonparticipating State. The funds may be used
only for the purpose(s) of achieving deinstitutionalization of status offenders and nonoffenders, separation
of juveniles from incarcerated adults, removal of juveniles from adult jails and lockups, and/or reducing the disproportionate
confinement of minority youth in secure facilities. Absent a request for extension which demonstrates compelling
circumstances justifying the reallocation of formula grant funds back to the State to which the funds were initially
allocated, or the pendency of administrative hearing proceedings under section 223(d), formula grant funds allocated
to a State which has failed to submit an application, plan, or monitoring data establishing its eligibility for the
funds will, beginning with Fiscal Year 1994, be reallocated to the nonparticipating State program on September 30
of the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated. Reallocated funds will be awarded to eligible recipients

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Assurances. The State must certify through the provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of assurances that it has complied and will comply (as appropriate) with section 223(a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6),
(7), (8)(c), (9), (10), (11), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (21), (22), and (25), and sections 229 and 261(d), in formulating
and implementing the State plan. The Formula Grant Application kit provides a form and guidance for the provision
of assurances. OJJDP interprets the 223(a)(16) assurance as satisfied by an affirmation that State law and/or policy
clearly require equitable treatment on the required bases; or by providing in the State plan that the State agency
will require an assurance of equitable treatment by all Formula Grant subgrant and contract recipients, and establish
as a program goal, in conjunction with the State Advisory Group, the adoption and implementation of a statewide juvenile
justice policy that all youth in the juvenile justice system will be treated equitably without regard to gender, race,
family income, and mentally, emotionally, or physically handicapping conditions. OJJDP interprets the 223(a)(25)
assurance as satisfied by a provision in the State plan for the State agency and the State Advisory Group to promulgate
policies and budget priorities that require the funding of programs that are part of a comprehensive and coordinated
community system of services as set forth in section 103(19) of the JJDP Act. This requirement is applicable when a
State's formula grant for any fiscal year exceeds 105 percent of the State's formula grant for Fiscal Year 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Serious juvenile offender emphasis. Pursuant to sections 101(a)(10) and 223(a)(10) of the JJDP Act, the Office
encourages States that have identified serious and violent juvenile offenders as a priority problem to allocate
formula grant funds to programs designed for serious and violent juvenile offenders at a level consistent with the
extent of the problem as identified through the State planning process. Particular attention should be given to improving
prosecution, sentencing procedures, providing resources necessary for informed dispositions, providing for
effective rehabilitation, and facilitating the coordination of services between the juvenile justice and criminal
justice systems.

mean that no conversation is possible. Separation must be accomplished in all secure areas of the facility which include,

(3)(i) Determine whether or not a facility in which juveniles are detained or confined is an adult jail or lockup. In
circumstances where juveniles are detained or confined in a separate building within a justice center or building
complex which includes both juvenile and adult facilities (same grounds) or in a separate juvenile area (floor, wing,
or side) of a building which includes an adult jail or lockup (same building), the separate building or area in which
juveniles are detained or confined may qualify as a juvenile detention facility. However, except when a collocated
building or area within a building has previously been determined by the State (with OJJDP concurrence) to qualify
as a separate juvenile detention facility under the four established requirements prior to the effective date of
this proposed regulation, State determinations and OJJDP concurrence on collocated facilities will be limited
to those which are located in geographic areas outside a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are operational or planned such that a determination of compliance with the criteria can be made, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are determined by the State (with subsequent OJJDP concurrence) to meet the criteria and procedure established in
paragraph (e)(3)(i) (A) through (D) and (ii) of this section, no later than December 31, 1994. Each of the following
four criteria must be met in order to ensure the requisite separateness of the two facilities. The requirements are:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Total separation between juvenile and adult facility spatial areas such that there could be no contact between
juveniles and adult residents in the respective facilities. Total separation in spatial areas of juvenile and adult
facilities can be achieved by providing for no common use areas, or by time-phasing common use areas, provided that
the arrangement precludes contact between juveniles and adult residents and adult facility staff at all times. Sleeping
or other living areas may not be considered common use areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Total separation in all juvenile and adult program activities within the facilities, including recreation,
education, counseling, health care, dining, sleeping, and general living activities. There must be an independent
and comprehensive operational plan for the juvenile detention facility which provides for a full range of separate
program activities. No program activities may be shared by juvenile and adult residents. However, program space,
equipment, and other resources may be used by both facility populations subject to the criterion in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A)
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Separate juvenile and adult staff, including management, security staff, and direct care staff such as recreation,
education, and counseling. Specialized services staff, such as cooks, bookkeepers and medical professionals who
are not normally in contact with detainees or whose infrequent contacts occur under conditions of separation of juveniles
and adults, can serve both. The day to day management, security and direct care functions of the juvenile detention
facility and its programs must be vested in totally separate staff. Collocated facilities classified by the State
with subsequent OJJDP concurrence prior to the effective date of this proposed regulation must also meet this requirement.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(D) In States that have established State standards or licensing requirements for secure juvenile detention facilities,
the juvenile facility meets the standards (on the same basis as free-standing juvenile detention facilities) and
is licensed as appropriate. Responsible State authorities must certify that all State standards or licensing requirements
for a secure juvenile detention facility have been met, and that the architectural and operational configuration
of the juvenile facility assures total separation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The State must initially determine that the four requirements are fully met. Upon such determination, the State
must submit to OJJDP a request to concur with the State finding that a separate juvenile facility exists. To enable
OJJDP to assess the separateness of the two facilities, sufficient documentation must accompany the request to demonstrate
that each requirement is met. In assessing the separateness of the two facilities pursuant to a State's request for
OJJDP concurrence, OJJDP will be guided by the ``rule of reason.'' If a facility is, in fact, a separate and distinct
living environment for juveniles in secure custody, and not simply a juvenile wing, section, or area of an adult jail
or lockup, a reasoned and reasonable application of the criteria will result in OJJDP's concurrence that a separate
juvenile detention facility exists. It is incumbent upon each State to make the initial determination through an
on-site facility (or full plan) review and, through the exercise of its oversight responsibility, to insure that
the separate character of the facility is maintained by continuing to fully meet each of the four criteria in the operation
of the juvenile detention facility.

section when the facility is located where conditions of distance to be traveled or the lack of highway, road, or other
ground transportation do not allow for court appearances within 24 hours, so that a brief (not to exceed an additional

after the time that such conditions allow for reasonably safe travel. States may use these additional statutory allowances
only where the precedent requirements set forth in paragraphs (f)(4) (i) through (v) of this section have been complied
with. This may necessitate statutory or judicial (court rule or opinion) relief within the State from the 24 hour initial
court appearance standard required by paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section. States must document and describe in
their annual monitoring report to OJJDP, the specific circumstances surrounding each individual use of the distance/ground

with (13) and (23) by the end of the fiscal year for any fiscal year beginning with 1994, the State's allotment under

) Removed all status and nonoffender juveniles from adult jails and lockups. Compliance with this standard requires
that the last submitted monitoring report demonstrate that no status offender (including those accused of or adjudicated
for violating a valid court order) or nonoffender juveniles were securely detained in adult jails or lockups for any
length of time; or, that all status offenders and nonoffenders securely detained in adult jails and lockups for any
length of time were held in violation of an enforceable State law and did not constitute a pattern or practice within
the State; or, the number of status offenders and nonoffenders securely detained in adult jails and lockups is less
than 9 per 100,000 juvenile population in the State; and

) Made meaningful progress in removing juvenile criminal-type offenders from adult jails and lockups. Compliance
with this standard requires the State to document a significant reduction in the number of jurisdictions securely
detaining juvenile criminal-type offenders in violation of section 223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act; or, a significant
reduction in the number of facilities securely detaining such juveniles; or, a significant reduction in the average
length of time each juvenile criminal-type offender is securely detained in an adult jail or lockup; or, that State
legislation has recently been enacted and taken effect and which the State demonstrates will significantly impact
the secure detention of juvenile criminal-type offenders in adult jails and lockups; and

Minority Detention and Confinement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 223(a)(23) of the JJDP Act, States must demonstrate specific efforts to reduce the proportion
of juveniles detained or confined in secure detention facilities, secure correctional facilities, jails and lockups
who are members of minority groups if such proportion exceeds the proportion such groups represent in the general
population, viz., in most States, youth between 10&hyph;17 are subject to secure custody. It is essential that States
approach this statutory mandate in a comprehensive manner. Compliance with this provision is achieved when a State
meets the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this section: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Identification.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Provide quantifiable documentation (State, county and local level) in the State's FY 1994 Formula Grant Plan (and
all subsequent Multi-Year Plans) Juvenile Crime Analysis and Needs Assessment to determine whether minority juveniles
are disproportionately detained or confined in secure detention and correctional facilities, jails and lockups
in relation to their proportion of the State juvenile population. Guidelines are provided in the OJJDP Disproportionate
Minority Confinement Technical Assistance Manual (see Phase I Matrix). Where quantifiable documentation is not
available to determine if disproportionate minority confinement exists in secure detention and correctional facilities,
jails and lockups, the State must provide a time-limited plan of action, not to exceed six months, for developing and
implementing a system for the ongoing collection, analysis and dissemination of information regarding minorities
for those facilities where documentation does not exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Assessment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each State's FY 1994 Formula Grant Plan must provide a completed assessment of disproportionate minority confinement.
Assessments must, at minimum, identify and explain differences in arrest, diversion and adjudication rates, court
dispositions other than incarceration, the rates and periods of prehearing detention in and dispositional commitments
to secure facilities of minority youth and non-minority youth in the juvenile justice system, and transfers to adult
court (see Phase II Matrix). If a completed assessment is not available, the State must submit a time-limited plan
(not to exceed 12 months from submission of the Formula Grant Application) for completing the assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intervention.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each State's FY 1995 Formula Grant Plan must, where disproportionate confinement has been demonstrated, provide
a time-limited plan of action for reducing the disproportionate confinement of minority juveniles in secure facilities.
The intervention plan shall be based on the results of the assessment, and must include, but not be limited to the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Diversion. Increasing the availability and improving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of diversion programs for minorities who come in contact with the juvenile justice system, such as police
diversion programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Prevention. Providing developmental, operational, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment assistance (financial and/or technical) for prevention programs in communities with a high percentage
of minority residents with emphasis upon support for community-based organizations (including non-traditional
organizations) that serve minority youth; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Reintegration. Providing developmental, operational, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and assessment assistance (financial and/or technical) for programs designed to reduce recidivism by facilitating
the reintegration of minority youth in the community following release from dispositional commitments to reduce
recidivism; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Policies and Procedures. Providing financial and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical assistance that addresses necessary changes in statewide and local, executive, judicial, and legal representation
policies and procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(v) Staffing and Training: Providing financial and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical assistance that addresses staffing and training needs that will positively impact the disproportionate
confinement of minority youth in secure facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The time-limited plans of action set forth in paragraphs (j) (1), (2) and (3) of this section must include a clear
indication of current and future barriers; which agencies, organizations, or individual(s) will be responsible
for taking what specific actions; when; and what the anticipated outcomes are. The interim and final outcomes from
implementation of the time-limited plan of action must be reported in each State's Multi-Year Plans and Annual Plan
Updates. Final outcomes for individual project awards are to be included with each State's annual performance report
[paragraph (h) of this section]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Technical assistance is available through the OJJDP Technical Assistance Contract to help guide States with
the data collection and analysis, and with programmatic elements of this requirement. Information from the OJJDP
Special Emphasis Initiative on Disproportionate Minority Confinement pilot sites will be disseminated as it becomes
available.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposed changes to the flight airworthiness standards for normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter
category airplanes. These proposals arise from the joint effort of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and
the European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) to harmonize the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) and the Joint
Aviation Requirements (JAR) for airplanes that will be certificated in these categories. The proposed changes would
provide nearly uniform flight airworthiness standards for airplanes certificated in the United States under 14
CFR part 23 (part 23) and in the JAA countries under Joint Aviation Requirements 23 (JAR 23) simplifying airworthiness
approvals for import and export purposes.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
At the June 1990 meeting of the JAA Council (consisting of JAA members from European countries) and the FAA, the FAA
Administrator committed the FAA to support the harmonization of the FAR with the JAR being developed for use by the
European authorities who are members of the JAA. In response to this commitment, the FAA Small Airplane Directorate
established an FAA Harmonization Task Force to work with the JAR 23 Study Group to harmonize part 23 and the proposed
JAR 23. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) also established a JAR 23/part 23 Committee to provide
technical assistance in this effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following a review of the first draft of proposed JAR 23, members of the FAA Harmonization Task Force and the GAMA Committee
met in Brussels, Belgium for the October 1990 meeting of the JAR 23 Study Group. Representatives from the Association
Europeenne des Constructeures de Material Aerospatial (AECMA), an organization of European airframe manufacturers,
also attended. The main agenda item for this meeting was the establishment of procedures to accomplish harmonization
of the airworthiness standards for normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes. The JAA had decided that its
initial rulemaking effort should be limited to these three categories and that commuter category airworthiness
standards should be addressed separately.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
After that meeting, technical representatives from each of the four organizations (GAMA, AECMA, FAA and JAA) met
to resolve differences between the proposed JAR and part 23. This portion of the harmonization effort involved a number
of separate meetings of specialists in the flight, airframe, powerplant, and systems disciplines. These meetings
showed that harmonization would require revisions to both part 23 and the proposed JAR 23.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Near the end of the effort to harmonize the normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplane airworthiness standards,
the JAA requested and received recommendations from its member countries on proposed airworthiness standards for
commuter category airplanes. The JAA and the FAA held specialist and study group meetings to discuss these recommendations,
which resulted in proposals to revise portions of the part 23 commuter category airworthiness standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike the European rules, where commuter category airworthiness standards are separate, for U.S. rulemaking,
it is advantageous to adopt normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category airworthiness standards simultaneously,
since commuter category airworthiness standards are already contained in part 23. Accordingly, this NPRM proposes
to revise the flight airworthiness standards for all part 23 airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the part 23 harmonization effort, the FAA established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56
FR 2190, January 22, 1991), which held its first meeting on May 23, 1991. The ARAC on General Aviation and Business Airplane
(GABA) Issues was established at that meeting to provide advice and recommendations to the Director, Aircraft Certification
Service, FAA, regarding the airworthiness standards in part 23 as well as related provisions of parts 91 and 135 of
the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA announced, on June 2&hyph;5, 1992, at the JAA/FAA Harmonization Conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,
that it would consolidate within the ARAC structure an ongoing objective to ``harmonize'' the JAR and the FAR. Coinciding
with that announcement, the FAA assigned the ARAC on GABA Issues those rulemaking projects related to JAR 23/part
23 harmonization that were in final coordination between the JAA and the FAA. The harmonization process included
the intention to present the results of JAA/FAA coordination to the public as NPRM's. Subsequently, the ARAC on GABA
Issues established an ARAC&hyph;JAR 23 Study Group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The JAR 23 Study Group made recommendations to the ARAC on GABA Issues concerning the FAA's disposition of the rulemaking
issues coordinated between the JAA and the FAA. The draft NPRM's previously prepared by the FAA harmonization team
were made available to the harmonization working group to assist them in their effort.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A notice of the formation of the JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization Working Group was published on November 30, 1992 (57 FR 56626).
The group held its first meeting on February 2, 1993. These efforts resulted in the proposals for flight airworthiness
standards contained in this notice. The ARAC on GABA Issues agreed with these proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA received unsolicited comments from the JAA dated January 20, 1994, concerning issues that were left unresolved
with the JAR 23 Study Group. The JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization Working Group did not address some of the unresolved issues
because the JAA had not yet reached positions on those issues. Unresolved issues will be dealt with at future FAR/JAR
Harmonization meetings. With respect to other issues unresolved by the JAR 23 Study Group, the JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization
Working Group recommendations did not reflect harmonization, but reflected the technical discussion of the merits
of each issue that had been throroughly debated at the JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization meetings. (The Working Group Chairperson
had been present at the Harmonization meetings.) The JAA comments have been placed in the docket for this proposal,
and will be considered along with those received during the comment period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following completion of these harmonization efforts, the FAA determined that the proposed revisions to part 23 were
too numerous for a single NPRM. The FAA decided to simplify the issues by issuing four NPRM's. These NPRM's address
the airworthiness standards in the specific areas of systems and equipment, powerplant, flight, and airframe. These
NPRM's propose changes in all seven subparts of part 23. Since there is some overlap, interested persons are advised
to review all four NPRM's to identify all proposed changes to a particular section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would make a change to the limited aerobatic operations authorized for utility category certification,
change the authorized commuter category certification maneuvers and prohibit dual type certification of commuter
category airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limitation for utility category airplanes in &sect;23.3(b)(2) would be revised to add an outside limit of 90 degrees
in angle of bank for lazy eights, chandelles, and steep turns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 23.3(d) would be revised to delete chandelles and lazy eights as approved operations in commuter category
airplanes because the FAA does not anticipate any operational need for such maneuvers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, &sect;23.3(e) would be revised to prohibit type certification of commuter category airplanes in any other
category. In the preamble discussion of Proposal 3 for Amendment No. 23&hyph;34 (52 FR 1806, January 15, 1987), the
FAA discussed the issue of dual certification, with emphasis on the issuance of airworthiness certificates. Since
then, the FAA has gained experience with airplanes certificated in both normal and commuter categories. The FAA has
found confusion among pilots and operators about the appropriate performance limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the proposed performance requirements, based on weight, altitude, and temperature (WAT) criteria (see
proposal for &sect;23.45), would alleviate some of the problems with current airplanes, the FAA proposes that commuter
category airplanes not have dual type certificates. One problem with dual type certification is pilot confusion.
WAT limits would differ between normal and commuter categories, requiring pilots who get type rated in these airplanes
to know two sets of limitations and to remember when each set of limitations is applicable. This proposed rule would
not preclude the type certification of similar airplanes with different model numbers, such as the present Cessna
models 500 and 501.

This proposal would make changes to &sect;23.25(a) and remove references to commuter category zero fuel weight in
paragraph (a) and standby power rocket engines in paragraph (a)(1)(iii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revised &sect;23.25(a) would clarify that the maximum weight that must be selected is the least of the three choices
given in &sect;23.25(a)(1). The airframe NPRM proposes moving the commuter category zero fuel weight requirement
in &sect;23.25(a) to &sect;23.343. The FAA proposes removing the reference to both standby power rocket engines
and to appendix E in &sect;23.25(a)(1)(iii) because this is a rare and obsolete design feature. If standby power rocket
engines were proposed as a design feature, the FAA would issue special conditions to ensure adequate airworthiness.

In Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Small Airplane Airworthiness Review Program Notice No. 4, Notice No. 90&hyph;18
(55 FR 26534, June 28, 1990), the FAA requested comments on the need for weight, altitude, and temperature (WAT) criteria,
as information or as a limitation on piston-powered, twin-engine part 23 airplanes. The FAA also requested comments
about WAT criteria on turbine-powered twin-engine part 23 airplanes, specifically during takeoff and landing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WAT criteria is used to determine the maximum weight an airplane can have in relation to altitude and temperature for
safe takeoff. This criteria provides a pilot with the information needed to determine if a takeoff and climb can be
successfully completed, including for multiengine airplanes, if one engine becomes inoperative. WAT criteria
has been required under part 23 for commuter category airplanes, at all approved altitudes. A limited WAT criteria
has been required for turbine engine powered airplanes at 5,000 feet and at standard temperatures plus 40
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, but not for higher altitudes or temperatures. For some multiengine powered airplanes WAT data has been provided
by the manufacturer as information to pilots but is not required to be followed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA received three comments on mandating WAT criteria in part 23. One commenter (GAMA) ``believes that WAT information
is useful but certainly not the only way to present operating data for any airplane'' and that making WAT criteria an
airplane or operating limitation for part 23 airplanes is ``an unnecessary and unjustified expansion or redirection
of operating criteria.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter (the Airline Pilots Associaton_ALPA) wants WAT information furnished during the certification
process. The commenter cites the variety of operational uses of these airplanes including in scheduled air carrier
and regional airline service. The commenter also cities the need for ``one level'' of safety as justification for
expanding the WAT requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other commenter (JAA) also supports WAT criteria. This commenter believes that the chance of a single-engine
failure on any airplane is high. Also, this commenter warns that safety considerations include airplane occupants
and personnel on the ground. According to the commenter, transport category airplanes follow WAT criteria by limiting
the operation of the airplane. Beyond the point where takeoff can be rejected, one-engine-inoperative climbs must
guarantee obstacle clearance. The commenter recognizes a need for generally similar requirements for commuter
category airplanes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The JAA believes that requiring a continued flight capability would preclude the operation of single-engine airplanes.
Also, the commenter believes that airplane size and stall speed provide characteristics that permit safe landings
in the event of an inoperative engine for single-engine airplanes and smaller multiengine airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter points out that between the two extremes of the transport category airplane and the single-engine airplane
lies the light twin-engine reciprocating airplanes and turbine engine airplanes, ranging from four seats to nine
and from 4,000 to 12,500 pounds. The commenter notes that, for these types of airplanes, it would be burdensome to require
compliance with full net flight path obstacle clearance. In the commenter's opinion, a safe forced landing becomes
less satisfactory with increased takeoff weight, involving longer stopping distances even for the same landing
speed. The commenter notes that the twin-engine airplanes have other significant adverse characteristics compared
to single-engine airplanes. First, an engine failure is twice as probable; second, asymmetric power demands immediate
pilot action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also points out that the inability to continue flight with one engine inoperative creates the following
situation: the chance of a second engine failure is increased; a suitable site for an emergency landing is reduced;
and the pilot resists the inevitable forced landing and tries to maintain flight. Training under more favorable conditions
may have taught the pilot to expect success in those situations. In unfavorable conditions, attempts to maintain
flight may lead to loss of airspeed at high asymmetric power and, commonly, loss of directional control that results
in a stall/spin accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter advocates certification and operating criteria for multiengine airplanes that blend the performance
requirements for a single-engine airplane and a transport category airplane. The commenter believes that the existing
requirements accept a limited period of risk just before and just after liftoff, where engine failure may not be fully
accounted for. The commenter believes that the application of WAT limits clearly accounts for actual conditions,
although the climb gradient requirements are lower than the requirements of part 25/JAR 25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter proposes no distinction between reciprocating and turbine engines. In the commenter's opinion, the
WAT criteria should be imposed, where applicable, as limitations through the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter does not believe that such proposals would involve costs disproportionate to the benefit. The commenter
suggests that the comment from the Small Airplane Airworthiness Review Conference, held October 22&hyph;26, 1984,
that such criteria would ``eliminate the certification of an entire class of airplanes,'' is an exaggeration. The
proposals are achievable, in the commenter's view, by typical modern light twin-engine airplanes with realistic
payloads, particularly the more significant executive/air taxi airplanes. The adoption of the WAT concept, in the
commenter's opinion, would instill a greater awareness of performance consideration in pilots from an early stage
of their training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also believes that the requirements on climb and handling qualities of the present &sect;&sect;23.65
and 23.67 are illogical and unreasonable. The commenter recommends using WAT criteria so that it applies equally
to all airplane operations because it offers improved airplane capability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter points out that manufacturers of ``WAT type'' airplanes routinely determine performance under a wide
range of conditions. The commenter also notes that flight manuals produced to the widely accepted General Aviation
Manufacturers Association (GAMA) specification already contain performance data beyond the minimum requirements
of part 23. In the commenter's opinion, additional testing or data scheduling create no additional costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine the necessity of applying WAT criteria to other than transport and commuter airplanes, the commenter
notes that present draft JAR 23 applies WAT limits only to piston-engine airplanes above 6,000 pounds and turbine-engine
airplanes. The JAR Operations Study Group proposes applying WAT limits to all JAR 23 airplanes in commercial operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, the FAA studied the accident record of reciprocating engine-powered, multiengine part 23 airplanes of over
6,000 pounds maximum takeoff weight with a substantial fleet size. The FAA completed the study using the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident briefs and evaluated those statistics over the study period of the individual
airplanes. The statistics show the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Over 100 accidents and 200 fatalities occurred due to engine failure during the study period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Forty-seven of the engine failure accidents occurred because the pilot failed to maintain flying speed and/or
directional control.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Engine reliability is a significant factor in the accident study. (For example, airplanes of similar or the same
aerodynamic configuration, but with different engines, have significantly different accident records.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the accident statistics, and recognizing the performance capabilities of the accident airplanes,
the FAA concludes the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Engine reliability would not be of major concern if the airplane had adequate performance on the remaining operative
engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The loss of flying speed and subsequent loss of airplane control would not be a significant problem if the airplane
exhibited adequate climb performance capabilities to fly out of an engine loss situation at low speeds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these statistics and conclusions from the FAA 1991 study and on comments, the FAA has determined that WAT limits
are necessary for safe operation of multiengine airplanes of the type that will be involved in transporting passengers
for hire. Operating rules (part 135) are already in place that specify some performance limitations. The cutoff weight
for reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of 6,000 pounds would encompass most airplanes of concern. All turbine
engine-powered airplanes are included because of the adverse effect of increasing temperatures on turbine engine
performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would change &sect;23.45 to require weight, altitude, and temperature (WAT) performance accountability
for normal, utility, and acrobatic airplanes with a maximum takeoff weight over 6,000 pounds and all turbine-powered
airplanes. Including WAT accountability necessitates reorganization and revisions to all paragraphs of this section.
The inclusion of WAT accountability in part 23 also requires changes to several other sections in part 23. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) would be revised to require that performance requirements be met for still air and ``standard atmosphere.''
Current (a)(1) uses the term ``standard atmospheric conditions.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicability of paragraph (a) (1) and (2) would be revised to require that all airplanes meet the performance
requirements in still air and standard atmosphere, and that ambient atmospheric conditions, which currently must
be met by commuter category airplanes, would have to be met by (1) commuter category airplanes, (2) reciprocating
engine-powered airplanes of more than 6,000 pounds maximum weight, and (3) turbine engine-powered airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) would replace current requirements of paragraph (b), pertaining to power or thrust available,
with the altitude and temperature requirements for performance data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.45(c) is modified &sect;23.51. It would require that performance data be determined with the
cowl flaps in the position used in cooling tests required by &sect;23.1041 to &sect;23.1047 and permits the cowl flap
position to be addressed uniformly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (d) is the same as current paragraph (c) pertaining to the determination of available propulsion
thrust. Proposed changes to &sect;23.45 (b), (c), (d), and (e) would delete references to ``thrust'' and retain just
``power,'' for standardization with the JAR. This is considered appropriate since power covers engine output, despite
how the absorbed power is transmitted to the atmosphere. The FAA proposes this change in subsequent sections where
the term ``power or thrust'' is used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (e) is the same as requirements of current paragraph (d) with a minor editorial revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new paragraph (f) is based on current paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(5)(i), which apply only to commuter category
airplanes. Proposed changes to &sect;23.45(f) would extend to all airplane categories the requirement for all takeoff
and landing procedures to be consistently executable by pilots of average skill. This is considered appropriate
since takeoffs and landings must be made routinely by operational pilots. It is also appropriate that takeoff and
landing performance data published in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) can be consistently achieved by operational
pilots.

Proposed new paragraph (g) would require determining takeoff distance, accelerate-stop distance, takeoff distance
and takeoff run, and landing distance on a smooth, dry, hard-surfaced runway. The FAA considers these limitations
necessary for WAT limited airplanes since the WAT takeoff performance is only valid on a particular defined surface.
The FAA does not consider the testing necessary to extend the same limitations to non-WAT airplanes burdensome to
applicants since that information is already available in GAMA Spec. No. 1 AFM's. Additionally, the proposal allows
for the derivation of landing and takeoff data on non-hard surfaces, such as grass and gravel and, thus, may not require
additional flight testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (h) is the same as current paragraph (e), which covers additional performance requirements for
commuter category airplanes, except for some minor revisions. In the list of items to be determined in paragraph (h)(3),
``landing distance'' would not be included since it would already be covered in proposed &sect;23.45(g). A reference
to &sect;23.67 in paragraph (h)(4) would be updated to be consistent with proposed revisions to that section in this
notice; and the phrase ``missed approaches'' would be changed to ``discontinued approaches'' to be consistent with
the proposed change to &sect;23.143. Proposed paragraph (h)(5)(i) requiring that the procedures must be able to
be consistently executed by a crew of average skill would have added to it ``in atmospheric conditions reasonably
expected to be encountered in service.'' These clarifying words would also appear in paragraph (h).

Section 23.49&blank;Stalling Speed
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 23.49 would be reorganized and edited for clarification. Currently the requirements for V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 requirements under paragraph (a). Existing paragraph (b) would be moved to paragraph (c) and existing paragraph
(c) would be moved to paragraph (d). Existing paragraph (e) would become paragraph (b) and the thrust conditions in
paragraph (f) would be incorporated under paragraph (a) items (1) and (2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed changes to paragraph (a) are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Proposed paragraph (a)(4) would be a requirement that the airplane be in the condition existing in the test, in
which V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
S0
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
S1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are being used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Proposed paragraph (a)(5) would be a revised version of current paragraph (a)(6). The current requirement states
that the center of gravity must be in the most unfavorable position within the allowable landing range. The proposed
requirement would state that the center of gravity must be in the position that results in the highest value of V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
S0
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
S1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) As mentioned under &sect;23.45, the current paragraph (a)(5) would be moved to &sect;23.45(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the changes are clarifying and not an increase in requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Section 23.51&blank;Takeoff Speeds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would revise the paragraph heading from ``Takeoff'' to ``Takeoff speeds'' and incorporate the takeoff
speed requirements currently contained in &sect;23.53. This revision to the heading and reorganization of takeoff
requirements is proposed for harmony with JAR 23.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.51(a) would be moved to &sect;23.53(a). Current paragraph (a) requires that the distance required
to take off and climb over a 50-foot obstacle must be determined with the engines operating within approved operating
limitations and with cowl flaps in the normal takeoff position. These requirements as modified would be covered under
proposed &sect;&sect;23.45 (c) and (d) and 23.1587.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.51(b) in measuring seaplane and amphibian takeoff distances would be deleted because it is a statement
of an acceptable method of compliance. Also, there is not a need for addressing a separate seaplane starting point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.51(c) concerning pilot skills and conditions would be deleted since it would be covered under the
general requirements in proposed &sect;23.45(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.51(d) would be deleted because the requirements are partly covered under &sect;23.45 in commuter
category performance and other performance requirements. In addition, the information requirements would be covered
under &sect;23.1587. Subpart G, under which &sect;23.1587 appears, is generally used to specify what information
must be in the AFM.

Proposed paragraph (a) would define V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
R
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as the speed at which the pilot makes a control input, with the intention of lifting the airplane out of contact with

single-engine airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the multiengine rotation speed discussed above, proposed paragraph (a) would include rotation speeds

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would move the takeoff speed requirements of the current &sect;23.53 to &sect;23.51. (See proposal
for &sect;23.51.) Proposed &sect;23.53 provides general takeoff performance requirements for normal, utility,
acrobatic, and commuter category airplanes. Proposed paragraph (a) is based on current &sect;23.51(a). Proposed

This proposal would revise &sect;23.55 to clarify the accelerate-stop segments and to make editorial changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This proposal would divide the accelerate-stop maneuver into three segments, rest to V

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to rest (proposed (a)(3)). This is not a new requirement, but it divides the total distance into three segments to be
considered. The phrase, ``in the case of engine failure,'' in current &sect;23.55(a)(2) would be deleted because
it would be included in proposed (a)(2). Also, the phrase, ``assuming that *&blank;*&blank;* the pilot has decided
to stop as indicated by application of the first retarding means at the speed V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' is deleted because it is stated in proposed &sect;23.51(c)(1)(ii). The ``exceptional skill'' phrase of &sect;23.55(b)(3)
would be deleted because it will remain in proposed &sect;23.45(h)(5)(i). The &sect;23.55(b) phrase ``if that means
is available with the critical engine inoperative'' would be deleted because it is covered by the safe and reliable
requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 23.57 would be revised to clarify and specify which takeoff path segments must be determined in flight. Proposed
paragraph (a) would clarify that the transition to the enroute configuration should be completed on or before reaching
1500 feet above the takeoff surface. In current &sect;23.57(c)(1), the slope of the airborne part of the takeoff path
must be ``positive at each point''; this is changed in proposed (c)(1) to ``not negative at any point,'' to allow acceleration
in level flight, which is implied by current &sect;23.61(c). A proposed editorial change to &sect;23.57(c)(3) would
specify that the climb gradient ``must not be less than *&blank;*&blank;*,'' as opposed to ``may not be less than.
*&blank;*&blank;*'' The option in current &sect;23.57(d) of determining the takeoff path, either by continuous
demonstration or by synthesis from segments, no longer reflects current practice, nor is it entirely desirable.
The only viable option in determining the takeoff path from rest to 35 feet above the takeoff surface is by a continuous
demonstration. The most practical method of determining the takeoff path from 35 feet to 1500 feet above the takeoff
surface is by synthesis from segments. Accordingly, proposed &sect;23.57(d) and (e) would incorporate these changes.

This proposal would clarify &sect;23.59 with no substantial change in requirements. The proposal would change the

not to present clearway data. The reference in current &sect;23.59(a)(2) and (b)(2) to ``along the takeoff path,''

Additionally, the reference to V

Proposed new &sect;23.63 would assemble general climb requirements from &sect;&sect;23.65 and 23.67 into a single
section and differentiate between WAT limited airplanes (reciprocating engine powered airplanes of above 6,000
pounds maximum takeoff weight and all turbine engine powered airplanes) and those airplanes that are not WAT limited
(reciprocating engine powered airplanes of 6,000 pounds or less). (See the proposed change to &sect;23.45 for discussion
of WAT limits.) Proposed new &sect;23.63(a)(1) would require that compliance be shown out of ground effect. This
requirement is in current &sect;23.67(e), which applies to commuter category airplanes. Proposed new &sect;23.63(a)(3)
requires that compliance must be shown, unless otherwise specified, with one engine inoperative, at a bank angle
not exceeding 5 degrees. This requirement is in current &sect;23.149 and has been applied generally for part 23 airplanes
except commuter category airplanes in certain circumstances.

This proposal would clarify &sect;23.65 and would change minimum climb speeds for multiengine airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed revisions to &sect;23.65(a) would change the applicability from ``each airplane'' as adopted in Amendment
No. 23&hyph;45 (58 FR 42136, August 6, 1993) to ``each normal, utility, and acrobatic category reciprocating engine-powered
airplane of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight.'' It would change the phrase ``angle of climb'' to ``climb gradient''
and establish the climb gradient at 8.3 percent for landplanes and 6.7 percent for seaplanes and amphibians with certain
specified performance conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The cowl flap requirements currently in paragraph (a)(5) would be moved to &sect;23.45(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.65(b) would be deleted. These requirements should have been deleted in Amendment No. 23&hyph;45
(58 FR 42136, August 6, 1993), but they were overlooked. Since the adoption of Amendment No. 23&hyph;45 there is no
longer a rate of climb requirement in &sect;23.65(a). The alternative means of compliance allowed by paragraph (b),
therefore, is obsolete and not consistent with the more stringent performance requirements proposed by this NPRM.
Also, the alternative means of compliance in paragraph (b) was rarely used by applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed &sect;23.65(b) would add WAT limits for reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of more than 6,000
pounds maximum weight and turbine engine-powered airplanes. (See proposal for &sect;23.45 for discussion of WAT
limits.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.65(c) would be moved to &sect;23.65(b) and the temperature and altitude requirements would be
deleted since WAT limits are proposed for turbine engine-powered airplanes and the four percent gradient would apply
at any approved takeoff ambient condition. Proposed &sect;23.65(b)(2) provides for landing gear down unless the
gear can be retracted in not more than seven seconds. This is more stringent than the present requirement, but the same
as the proposed one-engine-inoperative takeoff climb requirements, and is considered appropriate to this weight
and class of airplane with WAT limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.65(d) would be deleted since the requirements would be covered in the proposed &sect;23.45(h)(2)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed new &sect;23.66 would require the determination of the one-engine-inoperative climb capacity of all WAT
limited reciprocating engine-powered and turbine engine-powered airplanes immediately after takeoff. Since
most reciprocating engine-powered airplanes do not have autofeather, the condition immediately after takeoff
can be critical. There is not a minimum climb requirement in this configuration, only the determination of the climb
or descent gradient. This information does not become a limitation; it is provided to the pilot in the AFM (see &sect;23.1587)
to allow the pilot to make informed judgments before takeoff.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would reorganize &sect;23.67 for harmonization with the JAR; and would require WAT limits for some
airplanes; require wings level climb up to 400 feet for commuter category airplanes, and make minor changes in airplane
configuration requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revised &sect;23.67(a) would specify the climb requirements for non-WAT airplanes with no change in requirements
for those airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.67(b) would specify climb requirements for WAT airplanes. WAT criteria would be applied for both
reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of more than 6,000 pounds maximum weight and turbine engine-powered airplanes.
(See the discussion of WAT limits in the proposed change to &sect;23.45.) Turbine engine-powered airplanes are currently
subject to limited WAT limitations under &sect;23.67(c), which would be incorporated into proposed &sect;23.67(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The takeoff flap position for normal, utility, and acrobatic category reciprocating engine-powered airplanes
of 6,000 pounds or less is changed to ``wing flaps retracted'' from ``most favorable position'' (current &sect;23.67(4)).
Wing flaps retracted is the position most used in certification and in service for this size of airplane. The proposed
change is contained in &sect;23.67(a)(1)(iv), (a)(2)(iv), and (b)(2)(iv).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.67(d) is deleted since all climb speeds (both all-engine and one engine inoperative) are scheduled

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
Y 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is also proposed to be deleted in all other sections of part 23 for the same reason.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.67(e) for commuter category airplanes would be redesignated as &sect;23.67(c) with no change
in requirements except that the takeoff climb with landing gear extended must be conducted with the landing gear doors
open. This is a conservative approach offered by the JAA to specify a definite gear door configuration and to delete
the requirement to determine performance during the transient condition of gear doors opening and closing. Proposed
&sect;23.67(c)(1) specifies that the first segment climb must be conducted with the wings level and further specifies
that the climb speed for the segment must be V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

LOF 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and whatever the applicant selects at gear retraction. Proposed &sect;23.67(c)(2) requires conducting the second
segment climb with wings level, which would be appropriate for operational scenarios.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current &sect;23.67(e)(1) requirements are partially moved to &sect;23.67(c) and the remainder are contained

Section 23.75&blank;Landing Distance

, and move the portion on brake pressures to &sect;23.735, Brakes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The introductory paragraph of this section would be revised to delete the reference to the AFM because part 23, subpart
B, is generally used to specify what must be determined during flight test and part 23, subpart G, is generally used
to specify what must be placed in the AFM. The introductory paragraph would also be revised to require landing distances
to be determined at standard temperature for each weight and altitude. Service experience has shown that landing
distances are not sensitive to temperatures. The use of standard temperature is consistent with WAT requirements
and the increased level of safety introduced in this NPRM. The revised introductory paragraph deletes the reference
to ``approximately 3 knots'' for seaplanes and amphibians because this information will be moved to advisory material
on acceptable methods of compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 and requires its use. (See proposal for &sect;23.73.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the current &sect;23.75(b) is deleted because proposed &sect;23.45 would specify these general requirements.
Proposed new &sect;23.75(b) clarifies that a constant configuration must be maintained throughout the maneuver.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revised &sect;23.75(d) would continue the current requirement for showing that a safe transition to the balked landing
conditions can be made and specify the weight that must be considered for the transition to the balked landing conditions.
This proposed new requirement reflects current industry practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new &sect;23.75(e) is a general requirement to ensure the reliability of the brakes and tires.

Proposed &sect;23.75(f) is revised by changing the first use of the word ``means'' to ``retardation means,'' and

the airplane. This topic is covered in proposed &sect;23.45(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section &sect;23.75(h) is deleted because the introductory paragraph of proposed &sect;23.75 would contain commuter

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would be revised to include additional WAT requirements and to make editorial changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed revisions to &sect;23.77 (a) and (b) would differentiate between WAT and non-WAT; and, in paragraph (b),
would include the more stringent WAT limited airplane requirements. (See proposal for &sect;23.45.) Section 23.77(a)(4)
adds a new climb speed requirement to ensure that acceleration is not required during the transition from landing
to balked landing. The climb gradient of &sect;23.77(b) was selected to be slightly less than the non-WAT airplane
sea level requirement as a tradeoff for a balked landing climb capability at all altitudes and temperatures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commuter category climb gradient of 3.3 percent specified in &sect;23.77(c) changes to 3.2 percent for consistency
with part 25. Additional editorial changes and deletions are proposed for &sect;23.77(c) because the general requirements
would be covered in the proposed &sect;23.45.

Proposed &sect;23.143(a) would be revised to add the phrase ``during all flight phases'' to the lead-in of the paragraph.
``Go-around'' would be added to the list of flight phases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The JAA/FAA decided, during FAR/JAR Harmonization meetings, that the term ``go-around'' included the all engine
balked landings of &sect;23.77, various all engine and one-engine-inoperative aborted landings specified in the
AFM, and the commuter category discontinued approach of &sect;23.67(c)(4). In this NPRM, balked landing refers
only to the all engine balked landing of &sect;23.77.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The table in paragraph (c) would be changed to show a change in two-hand roll force from 60 to 50 pounds, which is consistent
with JAR 25. The table also would be changed to show a one-hand on the rim roll force of 25 pounds. This is a JAA/FAA harmonized
value.

Proposed &sect;23.161(d) would make editorial changes in the introductory paragraph. It would reference the appropriate
&sect;23.67 requirements and delete commuter category speed ranges, which are moved to the new &sect;23.161(e).
Section &sect;23.161(d)(4) is revised to specify flaps retracted instead of referencing the &sect;23.67 configurations.
Flaps retracted is the likely sustained configuration where a pilot would need to trim. Also, the flaps retracted
configuration for &sect;23.161(d)(4) would be consistent with the proposed &sect;23.67.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.175(a)(1) would change the flap position from the climb position to the flaps retracted position.
This is a clarifying change since virtually all part 23 airplanes use flaps retracted for climb. Also, this proposed
change would align the part 23 and part 25 climb static longitudinal stability requirements.

Proposed &sect;23.175(a)(3) would delete the option for the applicant to select some power other than maximum continuous
power as an operating limitation. As noted in the proposed change to &sect;23.155, this would eliminate a power specification
that is unnecessary and simplify normal operations for the pilot. Proposed &sect;23.175(a)(4) would make the trim
speed consistent with the enroute all-engine climb speed.

Proposed revisions to &sect;23.177 would delete the requirements for two-control airplanes, make minor clarifying
changes, and specify an exclusion for acrobatic category airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.177 would delete the introductory phrase concerning three-control airplanes, which is consistent
with the deletion of the requirements for two-control airplanes in current paragraph (b). The two-control airplane
regulations were introduced in 1945 but no two-control airplanes have been certificated for several decades and
no need is foreseen for these regulations. If an applicant proposes a two-control airplane, the FAA would issue special
conditions. After deleting the introductory portion of &sect;23.177(a), paragraph (a)(1) would be redesignated
as (a). In the first sentence, the proposed change replaces ``skid'' with ``wings level sideslip'' to clarify the
intended maneuver. Also, the proposed change increases the power requirement for demonstration of directional
stability in the landing configuration. The current requirement specifies power necessary to maintain a three degree
angle of decent. Maximum continuous power is considered appropriate since directional stability should be maintained
during a balked landing, particularly since directional instability is an undesirable characteristic at any point
in the flight envelope. Also, V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is replaced by V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to be consistent with &sect;23.1507.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.177(b), currently (a)(2), replaces ``any'' with ``all'' in the first sentence to clarify that
all landing gear and flap positions must be addressed. Also, the proposed paragraph would specify a minimum speed
at which static lateral stability may not be negative, as 1.3 V
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
S
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, for all configurations except takeoff. This is consistent with the other speeds specified in &sect;23.177(b) and
relieves the requirement for other than takeoff speeds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new &sect;23.177(c) would provide an exclusion for the dihedral effect for acrobatic category airplanes
approved for inverted flight. The proposed change recognizes that, in fully acrobatic airplanes, the dihedral effect
is not a desired characteristic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of proposed &sect;23.147(c), which ensures lateral control capability without the use of the primary
lateral control system, compensates for the relieving nature of proposed &sect;23.177(b) and the exception from
the requirements of &sect;23.177(b) for acrobatic category airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Present &sect;23.177(a)(3) is redesignated as &sect;23.177(d). The proposed &sect;23.177(d) deletes the next
to the last sentence, concerning bank angle and heading, because the current requirement is not a necessary test condition
and a constant heading during the sideslip may be impossible in some airplanes.

Section 23.201&blank;Wings Level Stall
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would delete both two-control airplanes and altitude loss requirements and would make clarifying
changes in &sect;23.201.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to &sect;23.201(a) deletes the applicability reference for an airplane with independently
controlled roll and directional controls. The last word, ``pitches'' is replaced by ``stalls'' since stalls may
be defined by other than nose-down pitching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Present &sect;23.201(b) is deleted since it applies to two-control airplanes. (See proposed change for &sect;23.177
for discussion of two-control airplane requirements.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current &sect;23.201(c) is divided into proposed &sect;23.201 (b) and (c). Proposed &sect;23.201(b) covers stall
recognition and proposed &sect;23.201(c) addresses stall recovery. Proposed &sect;23.201(b) clarifies that
the test should start from a speed at least 10 knots above the stall speed. Proposed &sect;23.201(b) has no change in
requirements. Section 23.201(c) is changed to specify how long the control must be held against the stop. This change
would ensure that the procedure for determining stall speed is the same procedure used to test stall characteristics.
The last sentence of current paragraph (c) on the increase of power is deleted because it would only apply to altitude
loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Present &sect;23.201(d) would be deleted, as suggested by the JAA, since the determination of altitude loss, and
its subsequent furnishing in the AFM, is not considered information useful to the pilot for safe operation of the airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.201(d) would be based on present &sect;23.210(e) and would be revised to clarify that the roll
and yaw limits apply during both entry and recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.201(e) is present paragraph (f) with some revisions. During FAR/JAR harmonization meetings,
the JAA pointed out to the FAA that in high power-to-weight ratio airplanes, extreme nose-up attitudes were the principal
criteria for use of reduced power, not the presence of undesirable stall characteristics. The FAA concurs and proposes
to delete the phrase concerning stall characteristics.

Section 23.203&blank;Turning Flight and Accelerated Turning Stalls
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;23.203 would be revised by adding the word ``turning'' before ``stalls'' and after ``accelerated''
in the heading, the introductory text, and in proposed paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(5). This proposed change clarifies
that accelerated stalls are performed in turning flight. Also, it clarifies the definition to show that accelerated
stalls are not intended to be performed in straight flight. This clarification reflects current practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.203 (a) and (b) would reference the stall definition in &sect;23.201(b), which is more specific
than the present general words ``when the stall has fully developed or the elevator has reached its stop.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For clarification, current paragraph (b)(4) would be separated into proposed paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) without
substantive change, and current paragraph (b)(5) would be redesignated as paragraph (b)(6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.203(c)(1) would clarify the wing flap positions by changing ``each intermediate position''
to ``each intermediate normal operating position.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to &sect;23.203(c)(4) would clarify the use of reduced power. (See the proposed change to &sect;23.201(f).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new paragraph (c)(6) has been added to be consistent with new &sect;23.207(c)(6) configurations (Amendment
No. 23&hyph;45).

Section 23.205&blank;Critical Engine-Inoperative Stalls
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would delete &sect;23.205. The present requirement to demonstrate stalls with the critical engine
inoperative is restricted to the enroute configuration and to a level of power asymmetry with which the airplane is
controllable with wings level at the stalling speed. As a result, the power on the operating engines at the stall is
normally fairly low, and neither the configuration nor the power setting represent the conditions most likely to
accompany an inadvertent stall in service. Reduction of power of the operating engine(s) during the recovery is permitted,
and it is questionable whether such action would be taken promptly in an inadvertent stall in service. Experience
shows that stalls with significant power asymmetry can result in a spin, even on airplanes that are certificated to
the present requirement. Apparently the requirement for demonstrating one-engine-inoperative stalls is not effective
in ensuring that inadvertent stalls in service with one engine inoperative will have satisfactory characteristics
and be recoverable. Sufficient protection against the hazard of stalling with one engine inoperative is provided
by the one-engine-inoperative performance requirements and operating speed margins, coupled with the requirements
for determination of V

Section 23.207&blank;Stall Warning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would delete the upper limit on stall speed margin and provide for mutable stall warning on acrobatic
category airplanes in &sect;23.207.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.207(c) would reference the stall tests required by &sect;23.201(b) and &sect;23.203(a)(1)
and specify that during such tests for one knot per second deceleration stalls, both wings level and turning, the stall
must begin at a speed exceeding the stalling speed by a margin of not less than 5 knots. The quantified upper limit in
the current rule of 10 knots or 15 percent of the stalling speed would be deleted. The upper limit has created problems
for manufacturers because of the complex design features required to show compliance. The upper limit requirement
was in effect replaced by the nuisance stall warning requirement in &sect;23.207.(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Present &sect;23.207(d) would be divided and moved to proposed &sect;23.207 (d) and (e). Proposed &sect;23.207(d)
on nuisance stall warnings would have no change in requirements. Proposed &sect;23.207(e) would delete the bottom
limit of five knots for decelerations greater than one knot per second. Also, it would specify that the stall warning
must begin sufficiently before the stall so that the pilot can take corrective action. This is considered appropriate
because, at the higher deceleration rates of three to five knots per second, a specified five knots may not be enough
stall warning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new &sect;23.207(f) allows for a mutable stall warning system for acrobatic category airplanes, with automatic
arming for takeoff and rearming for landing. This feature is useful for acrobatic pilots and provides safeguards
for takeoff and landing.

Secion 23.221&blank;Spinning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would revise the point to start the one-turn-spin recovery count, delete the ``characteristically
incapable of spinning'' option, and make minor changes in acrobatic category spins in &sect;23.221.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.221(a) would replace the exception for airplanes characteristically incapable of spinning
with an exception for airplanes that demonstrate compliance with the optional spin resistant requirements of paragraph
(a)(2) of this section. Criteria for an airplane incapable of spinning are unnecessary since criteria for spin resistant
airplanes are provided. Proposed &sect;23.221(a) would change the point at which the count for the one-turn-spin
recovery begins. The change would specify a more specific point to begin the count by replacing the current phrase
``after the controls have been applied'' with ``after initiation of the first control action for recovery.'' Under
the present rules, if an applicant proposes a multiple step recovery procedure that starts with the rudder, then the
airplane may be effectively recovered before the start of the recovery count.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.221(a)(1)(ii) would specify that no control force or characteristic can adversely affect prompt
recovery. This would be an improvement over the present prohibition of excessive back pressure in current &sect;23.221(a)(1)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Present &sect;23.221(a)(1) is proposed to be recodified into &sect;23.221(a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) with no
changes in the requirements. Present &sect;23.221(a)(2) on spin resistant airplanes would be restated with minor
editorial changes but with no change in requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.221(b) would specify the emergency egress requirements of &sect;23.807(b)(5) for those utility
category airplanes approved for spinning. This is considered an appropriate way to cross-reference the requirements
of &sect;23.807 to the flight requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed &sect;23.221(c) introductory paragraph would require acrobatic category airplanes to meet the one-turn-spin
requirements of &sect;23.221(a). This change is proposed because acrobatic category airplanes should have sufficient
controllability to recover from the developing one-turn-spin under the same conditions as normal category airplanes.
The proposed introductory paragraph would also cross-reference &sect;23.807 for emergency egress requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.221(c) pertaining to acrobatic category airplanes would add a requirement in proposed paragraph
(c)(1) for spin recovery after six turns or any greater number of turns for which certification is requested. The proposed
rule would require recovery within 1.5 turns after initiation of the first control action for recovery. This proposed
requirement would ensure recovery within 1.5 turns if the spin mode changes beyond six turns. As an alternative, the
applicant may stop at six turns and provide a limitation of six turns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.221(c)(2) would delete the option to retract flaps during recovery and would provide the applicant
with a choice of flaps up or flaps deployed for spin approval. The paragraph would continue to prohibit exceeding applicable
airspeed limits and limit maneuvering load factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new &sect;23.221(c)(4) is proposed to ensure that the acrobatic spins do not cause pilot incapacitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present &sect;23.221(d) is proposed to be deleted. The recognition of airplanes that are ``characteristically
incapable of spinning'' has been in the regulation since at least 1937. In 1942, the present weight, center of gravity,
and control mis-rig criteria were introduced into Civil Air Regulation (CAR) 03. Since then, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) spin resistant requirements, which are based on research, have been developed and
incorporated in the regulations by Amendment No. 23&hyph;42 (56 FR 344, January 3, 1991). If an applicant proposes
a non-spinable airplane, it would be appropriate to apply the more technologically advanced requirements of proposed
&sect;23.221(a)(2); therefore, &sect;23.221(d) would be deleted.

reciprocating engine-powered airplanes over 6,000 pounds. This change is proposed because these airplanes are
subject to WAT limits and it will ensure that airplane engines will cool at the ambient temperature limit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1545(b)(5) would delete any one-engine-inoperative best rate of climb speed marking requirements
for WAT limited airplanes. These airplanes would already have scheduled speeds in case of an engine failure. Proposed
paragraph (b)(5) would apply only to non-WAT airplanes for which the one-engine-inoperative best rate of climb speed
marking has been simplified to sea level at maximum weight. Since the blue arc rule was promulgated in Amendment No.
23&hyph;23 (43 FR 50593, October 30, 1978), certification experience has shown that the marking of an arc is unnecessarily
complicated. For many airplanes, the arc was so narrow that the arc was a line. Therefore, proposed paragraph (b)(5)
would require a blue radial line instead of an arc.

Proposed new &sect;23.1581(a)(3) would require information necessary to comply with relevant operating rules.
This is a FAR/JAR harmonization item and is considered necessary because some operational rules, such as &sect;135.391,
require flight planning with one-engine-inoperative cruise speed and/or driftdown data. For airplanes operated

that the AFM include the maximum takeoff weight for each airport altitude and ambient temperature within the range
selected by the applicant at which the accelerate-stop distance determined under &sect;23.55 is equal to the available
runway length plus the length of any stopway, if available. This is currently required for transport category airplanes

This proposal would rearrange the current material in &sect;23.1585 and add additional requirements as discussed
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1585(a) would contain the requirements applicable to all airplanes. The requirements would
be arranged in a different order from the current requirements in paragraph (a). The requirements for information
that must be included cover_unusual flight or ground handling characteristics; maximum demonstrated values of
crosswinds; recommended speed for flight in rough air; restarting an engine in flight; and making a normal approach
and landing in accordance with &sect;23.73 and &sect;23.75. All of these requirements are in current &sect;23.1585(a)
except for restarting a turbine engine in flight, which is in current paragraph (c)(5) pertaining only to multiengine
airplanes. The FAA decided that a restart capability is not required for single reciprocating engine airplanes for
the reasons given in the preamble discussion of proposal 3 in Amendment No. 23&hyph;43 (58 FR 18958, April 9, 1993).
The requirement for providing restart information should apply to single turbine engines, since turbine engine
designs incorporate a restart capability and inadvertent shutdowns may occur. Normal approach and landing information
in accordance with the landing requirement in proposed &sect;23.73 and &sect;23.75 is new. This is necessary to enable
pilots to achieve the published landing distances and, if necessary, to safely transition to a balked landing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1585(b) would be a revision of &sect;23.1585(b) on gliding after an engine failure for single-engine

 as determined in &sect;23.149. Current paragraph (c) requirements for information on procedures for continuing
a takeoff following an engine failure and continuing a climb following an engine failure would be moved to proposed
(e) for normal, utility, and acrobatic multiengines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1585(d) would apply to normal, utility and acrobatic airplanes. These airplanes would have to
comply with paragraph (a) and either (b) or (c). These airplanes would also have to comply with the normal takeoff,
climb, and the abandoning a takeoff procedures, which are currently contained in paragraph (a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, &sect;23.1585(c), for normal, utility and acrobatic multiengine airplanes, would require
compliance with proposed (a), (c), and (d) plus requirements for continuing a takeoff or climb with one engine inoperative,
which are now in current paragraph (c) (1) and (2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1585(f) would require commuter category airplanes to comply with paragraphs (a) and (c) plus
the normal takeoff requirements from current paragraph (a)(2) revised; accelerate-stop requirements, which are
new, and continuing takeoff after engine failure, which are in current paragraph (c)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Proposed &sect;23.1587 would rearrange existing material, delete ski plane performance exceptions, delete the
option of calculating approximate performance, delete stall altitude loss data, and require overweight landing
performance in &sect;23.1587. Stalling speed requirements of current paragraph (c) (2) and (3) would be combined
and moved to paragraph (a)(1) and would reference the stalling speed requirement of &sect;23.49. Information on
the steady rate and gradient of climb with all engines operating would be required by proposed paragraph (a)(2). This
is revised from current paragraph (a)(2). The reference would be changed to proposed &sect;23.69(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed (a)(3) would require, as is now required, that landing distance be determined under &sect;23.75, and would
add that this must be provided for each airport altitude, standard temperature, and type of surface for which it is
valid. Proposed paragraph (a)(4) would require information on the effect on landing distance when landing on other
than hard surface, as determined under &sect;23.45(g). Proposed paragraph (a)(5) would cover information on the
effects on landing distance of runway slope and wind. This would provide the pilot with data with which to account for
these factors in his or her takeoff calculations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current requirements in &sect;23.1587(b) on ski planes would be deleted. Proposed paragraph (b) would add a steady
angle of climb/descent requirement as determined under &sect;23.77(a). This requirement would apply to all non-WAT
airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (c) would apply to normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes, rather than all airplanes
as in current paragraph (c). The proposed (c) would delete stall altitude loss requirements that are in current paragraph
(c)(1). As mentioned, current stalling speed requirements would be moved to proposed paragraph (a)(1). Current
paragraph (c)(4) on cooling climb speed data would also be deleted since all airplanes would cool at scheduled speeds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (c)(1) would pertain to the takeoff distance determined under &sect;23.53 and the type of surface.
Proposed paragraph (c)(2) and (c)(3) pertain to the effect on takeoff distance of the runway surface, slope, and headwind
and tailwind component.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (c)(4) would impose a new requirement pertaining to the one-engine inoperative takeoff climb/descent
performance for WAT-limited airplanes. This pertains only to reciprocating engine-powered airplanes. It would
provide the pilot with the information determined under proposed &sect;23.66.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (c)(5) pertains to enroute rate and gradient of climb/descent determined under &sect;23.69(b),
for multiengine airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;23.1587(d) for commuter category airplanes would incorporate the present data plus the addition
of accelerate-stop data, overweight landing performance, and the effect of operation on other than smooth hard surfaces.
In addition, in order to consolidate all of the requirements for what must appear in the AFM in subpart G, proposed &sect;23.1587(d)(10)

Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation, Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination, and Trade Impact Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs
that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic impact of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs
agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA
has determined that this rule: (1) Would generate benefits that justify its costs and is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is not significant as defined in DOT's Policies and Procedures; (3)
would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) would not constitute a barrier
to international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below.

Regulatory Evaluation Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of the 57 sections that would be amended or added in this proposed rule, the FAA has identified 15 that could result in
additional compliance costs in one or more airplane categories. Amendments to five sections could result in cost
savings. The greatest costs would be incurred by manufacturers of WAT limited airplanes (e.g., multiengine airplanes
with maximum weights of more than 6,000 pounds). When amortized over a production run, the quantified incremental
costs would be relatively modest_less than $100 per airplane. The FAA solicits comments concerning the incremental
certification/development costs attributable to the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary benefit of the proposed rule would be the cost efficiencies of harmonization with the JAR for those manufacturers
that choose to market airplanes in JAA countries as well as to manufacturers in JAA countries that choose to market
airplanes in the U.S. Other benefits of the proposed rule would be decreased reliance on special conditions, simplification
of the certification process through clarification of existing requirements, and increased flexibility through
optional designs.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by Federal regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if
a proposed rule would have a significant economic impact, either detrimental or beneficial, on a substantial number
of small entities. Based on FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, the FAA has determined
that the proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The proposed rule would not constitute a barrier to international trade, including the export of American airplanes
to foreign countries and the import of foreign airplanes into the United States. Instead, the proposed flight certification
procedures would be harmonized with those of the JAA and would lessen restraints on trade.

Federalism Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA proposes to revise the flight airworthiness standards for normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category
airplanes to be compatible with the same standards that will be proposed for the same category airplanes by the Joint
Airworthiness Authority in Europe. If adopted, the proposed revision would reduce the regulatory burden on the United
States and European airplane manufacturers by relieving them of the need to show compliance with different standards
each time they seek certification approval of an airplane in a different country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Evaluation, the FAA has determined
that this proposed regulation is not a significant regulatory action. In addition, the FAA certifies that this proposal,
if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). An initial regulatory evaluation of the proposal has been placed in the
docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under

action appropriate to the situation, with the airplane initially in trim, in the following conditions:

(5) All propeller controls in the position at which compliance with &sect;23.69(a) has been shown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For all airplanes, it must be shown that the airplane is safely controllable without the use of the primary lateral
control system in any all-engine configuration(s) and at any speed or altitude within the approved operating envelope.
It must also be shown that the airplane's flight characteristics are not impaired below a level needed to permit continued
safe flight and the ability to maintain attitudes suitable for a controlled landing without exceeding the operational
and structural limitations of the airplane. If a single failure of any one connecting or transmitting link in the lateral
control system would also cause the loss of additional control system(s), the above requirement is equally applicable
with those additional systems also assumed to be inoperative.

. Each airplane must meet the trim requirements of this section after being trimmed and without further pressure upon,
or movement of, the primary controls or their corresponding trim controls by the pilot or the automatic pilot. In addition,
it must be possible, in other conditions of loading, configuration, speed and power to ensure that the pilot will not
be unduly fatigued or distracted by the need to apply residual control forces exceeding those for prolonged application
of &sect;23.143(c). This applies in normal operation of the airplane and, if applicable, to those conditions associated
with the failure of one engine for which performance characteristics are established.

 in other configurations, up to the maximum allowable speed for the configuration being investigated, in the takeoff,

 in other configurations. The angle of sideslip for these tests must be appropriate to the type of airplane, but in no
case may the constant heading sideslip angle be less than that obtainable with a 10 degree bank, or if less, the maximum
bank angle obtainable with full rudder deflection or 150 pound rudder force.

 for any landing gear and flap positions, and for any symmetrical power conditions up to 50 percent of maximum continuous
power, the aileron and rudder control movements and forces must increase steadily, but not necessarily in constant
proportion, as the angle of sideslip is increased up to the maximum appropriate to the type of airplane. At larger slip
angles, up to the angle at which full rudder or aileron control is used or a control force limit contained in &sect;23.143
is reached, the aileron and rudder control movements and forces must not reverse as the angle of sideslip is increased.
Rapid entry into, and recovery from, a maximum sideslip considered appropriate for the airplane must not result in
uncontrollable flight characteristics.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Normal category airplanes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A single-engine, normal category airplane must be able to recover from a one-turn spin or a three-second spin, whichever
takes longer, in not more than one additional turn after initiation of the first control action for recovery, or demonstrate
compliance with the optional spin resistant requirements of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The following apply to one turn or three second spins:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For both the flaps-retracted and flaps-extended conditions, the applicable airspeed limit and positive limit
maneuvering load factor must not be exceeded;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) No control forces or characteristic encountered during the spin or recovery may adversely affect prompt recovery;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) It must be impossible to obtain unrecoverable spins with any use of the flight or engine power controls either
at the entry into or during the spin; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For the flaps-extended condition, the flaps may be retracted during the recovery but not before rotation has
ceased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) At the applicant's option, the airplane may be demonstrated to be spin resistant by the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) During the stall maneuver contained in &sect;23.201, the pitch control must be pulled back and held against the
stop. Then, using ailerons and rudders in the proper direction, it must be possible to maintain wings-level flight
within 15 degrees of bank and to roll the airplane from a 30 degree bank in one direction to a 30 degree bank in the other
direction;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Reduce the airplane speed using pitch control at a rate of approximately one knot per second until the pitch control
reaches the stop; then, with the pitch control pulled back and held against the stop, apply full rudder control in a
manner to promote spin entry for a period of seven seconds or through a 360 degree heading change, whichever occurs
first. If the 360 degree heading change is reached first, it must have taken no fewer than four seconds. This maneuver
must be performed first with the ailerons in the neutral position, and then with the ailerons deflected opposite the
direction of turn in the most adverse manner. Power and airplane configuration must be set in accordance with &sect;23.201(e)
without change during the maneuver. At the end of seven seconds or a 360 degree heading change, the airplane must respond
immediately and normally to primary flight controls applied to regain coordinated, unstalled flight without reversal
of control effect and without exceeding the temporary control forces specified by &sect;23.143(c); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Compliance with &sect;&sect;23.201 and 23.203 must be demonstrated with the airplane in uncoordinated flight,
corresponding to one ball width displacement on a slip-skid indicator, unless one ball width displacement cannot
be obtained with full rudder, in which case the demonstration must be with full rudder applied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The airplane must recover from any point in a spin up to and including six turns, or any greater number of turns for
which certification is requested, in not more than one and one-half additional turns after initiation of the first
control action for recovery. However, beyond three turns, the spin may be discontinued if spiral characteristics
appear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicable airspeed limits and limit maneuvering load factors must not be exceeded. For flaps-extended configurations
for which approval is requested, the flaps must not be retracted during the recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) It must be impossible to obtain unrecoverable spins with any use of the flight or engine power controls either at
the entry into or during the spin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) There must be no characteristics during the spin (such as excessive rates of rotation or extreme oscillatory motion)
that might prevent a successful recovery due to disorientation or incapacitation of the pilot.
