SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is updating the table of normal cost percentages that Federal agencies pay
to finance the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). This regulation is necessary for the table to reflect
the changes in the rates that are effective in October 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 21, 1993, OPM published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice changing the normal cost percentages effective in October 1994. Subpart D of Part 841 of Title 5, Code of Federal
Regulations, contains the methodology that OPM uses to determine the rates that agencies must pay to fund the cost
of the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and the procedures that OPM must follow to change the rates. Under
those procedures, OPM must publish a notice of changes in the rates at least 3 months before the beginning of the fiscal
year in which the new rates become effective.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix A to Subpart D of Part 841 contains a table of the normal cost percentages. This table has no regulatory effect.
It merely provides information about the rates. This final rule amends that table to reflect the rates that will become
effective in October 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 553(b)(3)(B) of title 5, United States Code, I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice
of proposed rulemaking. Notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary because this final rule merely provides information
and has no regulatory effect.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 16, 1994, OPM published (59 FR 12143) a final rule concerning payment of survivor deposits by actuarial reduction.
(FR Doc. 94&hyph;6046) This document adopted OPM's interim rule on that subject as final rules. In two places, reference
to the page number for the interim rule was stated incorrectly. In both places, the incorrect reference to 58 FR 56877
is corrected to 58 FR 52877.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because the regulation only provides information about the rate of payment by Federal agencies to OPM for the normal
cost of their employees' FERS benefits.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 928 [7 CFR Part 928] regulating the handling
of papayas grown in Hawaii, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 120 papaya handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering fresh papayas
grown in Hawaii, and approximately 400 producers of papayas in Hawaii. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of these
handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule suspends for an indefinite period the minimum grade and the inspection requirements in effect under the
order. This action was recommended by the Papaya Administrative Committee (committee) on April 22, 1994, by a vote
of 8 in favor, 2 opposed, and 2 abstentions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee meets prior to and during each season to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous basis
for papayas regulated under the order. The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well
as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the rules
and regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 928.52 of the order authorizes the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container regulations
for fresh shipments of papayas. Section 928.53 allows for the modification, suspension or termination of such regulations
when warranted. Section 928.55 provides that whenever papayas are regulated pursuant to &sect;928.52 or &sect;928.53,
such papayas must be inspected by the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service and certified as meeting the applicable
requirements of such regulation. The cost of inspection and certification is borne by handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 928.313 of the rules and regulations currently in effect under the order establishes minimum grade requirements
for fresh shipments of Hawaiian papayas. This rule suspends &sect;928.313, which requires that such papayas grade
at least Hawaii No. 1, except that not more than 5 percent of the fruit may be immature, and that the weight requirements
specified in the Hawaiian grade standards do not apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current minimum grade requirement has been in effect since 1984. The objective of this requirement was to provide
that only acceptable quality fruit enter fresh market channels, thereby ensuring consumer satisfaction, increasing
sales, and improving returns to papaya producers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the industry continues to believe that quality is an important factor in maintaining sales, the committee recommended
this suspension because it believes the cost of inspection and certification (mandated when the grade regulations
are in effect) exceeds the benefits derived. The cost of papaya inspections on a per pound basis averages about $.006,
which is nearly as much as the assessment rate established under the order to cover the order's administrative and
promotion costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee members supporting the suspension stated that such action would be in the best interests of producers,
because eliminating the cost of inspection will increase producer returns. Those members contend that the marketplace
will dictate fruit quality, and competition among shippers will ensure shipments of good quality fruit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the industry is pursuing alternative means of improving and ensuring quality, such as providing financial
incentives to producers to deliver good quality fruit to handlers. Current industry practice is for producers to
deliver their fruit to handlers for grading, packing and marketing. Producers are paid by handlers based, in part,
on the quality of fruit they deliver. Producer prices are reduced to reflect the amount of fruit that is discarded during
handling because it is of unacceptable quality. All producers delivering fruit to a particular handler are typically
paid the same amount for their fruit, based on the average quality delivered by all producers. This practice causes
producers delivering high quality fruit to be penalized by producers delivering poorer quality fruit. A newly formed
producers' bargaining cooperative is attempting to change this practice by having low quality fruit attributed
to individual producers. That is, an individual producer would be paid based upon the quality of fruit that individual
delivered to the handler. Thus, producers would have a financial incentive to harvest and deliver high quality product.
This should help improve and maintain the quality of papayas entering the fresh market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee members opposed to the suspension stated that it would allow poor quality fruit on the market and have a negative
impact on the market. Additionally, those members believe that such a suspension will be perceived negatively by
the State of Hawaii Department of Agriculture. They are also concerned about the length of time necessary to reinstate
the grade requirements, if it is determined that such action is needed in the future to ensure that only fruit of acceptable
quality is shipped to fresh markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of committee members acknowledge the possibility that fruit quality could decline as a result of this
action, but do not believe that this is likely. They believe that the reduction in handling costs due to elimination
of mandatory inspection will outweigh any declines in returns attributable to reduced quality. Further, the committee
will monitor the impact this action has on the market, and will recommend reinstatement of quality standards if warranted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule suspends grade and inspection requirements in effect for fresh papayas. Such suspension will enable handlers
to ship papayas to the fresh market at a reduced cost, since handlers will no longer be required to have their fruit inspected
and pay the resulting inspection costs. Suspending grade requirements for fresh papayas is expected to increase
producer returns by reducing costs and maintaining the quality of fruit offered for sale. The industry is committed
to instituting alternative means of quality assurance by providing incentives to producers to harvest and deliver
only acceptable quality fruit. This activity should ensure that consumers continue to receive good quality fresh
papayas. This rule is in the best interest of producers, handlers and consumers, and is expected to increase returns
to papaya producers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's view is that this rule will have a beneficial impact on producers and handlers, since it will permit
the industry to ship fruit without paying the cost of inspection, thus improving producers' returns, and is not expected
to adversely impact the quality of fruit entering fresh markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the suspension of &sect;928.313, this rule also suspends &sect;&sect;928.150 and 928.152 of the
rules and regulations in effect under the order. Section 928.150 provides a means for handlers to receive waivers
from the mandatory inspection requirement under certain circumstances, and &sect;928.152 authorizes exemptions
from the current grade requirement relating to fruit maturity. Since this action suspends mandatory inspection
and grade requirements, these rules authorizing exemptions from such requirements would no longer be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A conforming change is also made in &sect;928.160, which requires handlers to file monthly utilization reports with
the committee. Among the information required to be submitted are the inspection certificate numbers applicable
to each fresh shipment of papayas. Since inspection will no longer be mandatory, the requirement that handlers submit
inspection certificate numbers would no longer be needed. Thus, &sect;928.160 is revised to suspend such requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number
0581&hyph;0102.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule should reduce the reporting burden on approximately 5 papaya handlers who have been completing PAC Form
7, Application to be an Approved Handler of Immature Papayas, and PAC Form 7(c), Immature Papaya Order Form. Form 7
is estimated to take 15 minutes to complete, and Form 7(c) about 10 minutes per form. No reduction in reporting burden
is expected as a result of the revision in &sect;928.160 pertaining to monthly utilization reports. While handlers
will no longer be required to provide inspection certificate numbers, the remaining information on the reports will
continue to be collected. It is estimated that each report requires 1 hour to complete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee,
and other information, it is found that the suspension of these sections, as set forth below, will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the

 because: (1) This rule suspends grade requirements for papayas grown in Hawaii; (2) Hawaiian papaya handlers are
aware of this suspension, which was recommended by the committee at a public meeting, and they will need no additional
time to comply with this suspension; (3) shipment of the 1994 season Hawaiian papaya crop is currently in progress;
(4) this rule needs to be made effective by July 1, 1994, to be of maximum benefit to the Hawaiian papaya industry; and
(5) the rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any comments received will be considered prior to any finalization
of this interim final rule.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim final rule amends outgoing inspection regulations under the California olive marketing order to authorize
handlers to use in-plant Quality Assurance Programs (QAPs) in lieu of continuous in-line inspection. This rule also
permits handlers to size whole pitted olives by diameter as an alternative to the current requirement that such olives
be sized by weight prior to pitting. Conforming changes are made to the size requirements for imported whole pitted
olives so that the requirements for domestic and imported olives are applied similarly. The changes in the California
olive requirements are designed to result in more efficient handling operations. The changes in import requirements
are necessary under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 148 and Marketing Order No. 932 [7 CFR Part 932], both
as amended, regulating the handling of olives grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order
is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter
referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim final rule is also issued pursuant to section 8e of the Act, which provides that whenever certain specified
commodities, including olives, are subject to grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements under a Federal marketing
order, the same or comparable requirements shall be applied to imports of those commodities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this interim final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This interim final rule
is not intended to have retroactive effect. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the impact of this interim final rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations issued
under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are 5 handlers of olives regulated under the order, and approximately 1,350 producers in the regulated area.
In addition, there are approximately 25 importers of olives subject to the requirements of the olive import regulation.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms, which include olive handlers and importers,
are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of the olive producers and importers
may be classified as small entities. None of the olive handlers may be so classified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Olive Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order, met on
December 14, 1993, and unanimously recommended revising outgoing inspection procedures to permit handlers to establish
a QAP in lieu of maintaining continuous in-line outgoing inspection of processed olives. Outgoing inspection is
the assignment of a final grade to the product after processing is completed, according to the requirements of the
U.S. Standards for Grades of Canned Ripe Olives (Standards) [7 CFR 52.3751 to 52.3764]. The committee also recommended
that handlers be allowed to size whole pitted olives by diameter after pitting, as an alternative to the current requirement
that such olives be sized by weight prior to pitting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to &sect;932.52 of the order, and &sect;932.152 of the current regulations, handlers are required to maintain
continuous in-line outgoing inspection for the handling of processed olives. Pursuant to &sect;932.53, such outgoing
inspection is performed by the Processed Products Branch (PPB) of the Department. Continuous in-line outgoing inspection
consists of inspection and grading services in an approved plant whereby one or more PPB inspector(s) are present
at all times the plant is in operation to make in-process checks on the preparation, processing, packing, and warehousing
of all products and to assure compliance with sanitary requirements. However, costs for continuous in-line outgoing
inspection have increased in recent years. Thus, the PPB is prepared to develop QAP inspection procedures which will
provide quality assurance certification for California olive handlers, thereby reducing handlers' inspection
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, most handlers employ their own quality-control personnel. The PPB is prepared to establish QAPs with
individual handlers as provided in the ``Regulations Governing Inspection and Certification of Processed Fruits
and Vegetables and Related Products'' [7 CFR 52.2]. As established, handlers will be permitted to use a QAP inspection
procedure rather than the currently-mandated continuous in-line outgoing inspection. Under a QAP, the PPB provides
training for the handler's quality-control personnel. The handler's quality-control personnel will be trained
in the same procedures currently used by the PPB inspectors. Once the handler's quality-control personnel are trained
to properly perform the same duties and responsibilities as a PPB inspector, a period of evaluation of the reliability
of the handler's quality control responsibilities begins. This is the reliability evaluation period. At such time
as the handler's quality-control personnel successfully complete the reliability evaluation period, a QAP will
begin operation with oversight provided by the PPB. The PPB inspectors will continue to issue certificates of inspection.
Certificates of inspection will be based on outgoing inspection records maintained by the handler's QAP personnel.
These will be verified through spot-checks and sample regrading by PPB inspectors. A QAP will continue to assure safe,
wholesome, and uniformly high-quality processed products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under a QAP, each handler and the PPB will develop an individually written plan tailored to each handler's facility.
A contract between the handler and the PPB will also be developed based upon the terms of the QAP. The contract will be
signed at the beginning of the reliability evaluation. Once a handler's QAP is approved, the handler is notified in
writing and the PPB begins verifying the work of the handler's QAP personnel. Such verification may include reviews
of plant sanitation, quality and non-quality product analyses, procedures and/or techniques, case-stamping,
checkloading, condition of container, or other types of procedures normally performed by the PPB. Inclusion of any
or all of these verification procedures will be determined by the operating characteristics of each handler's facility
or facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the event deviations from proper QAP procedures are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detected by the PPB during the reliability verification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, the handler will be informed of the problem and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective action required. If corrective action is taken, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the QAP continues in operation. Continued deviations may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in suspension of QAP approval. The suspension may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanent or temporary and may only be restored upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurrence by the PPB. During any suspension, the handler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required to use continuous in-line inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishing a QAP inspection procedure meets marketing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order inspection requirements, and provides handlers with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative to continuous in-line inspection (which requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the presence of a PPB inspector during final processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the packaging of olives). To effectuate this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change, paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of &sect;932.152, Outgoing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, are revised to add authority for handlers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use either the QAP process or continuous in-line inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 932.52 authorizes sizing of whole pitted olives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based upon count-per-pound designations (the actual weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of individual fruit) or modifications recommended by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee and approved by the Secretary. Section 932.152 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently specifies that all processed olives must be sized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with the count-per-pound designations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established for canned whole ripe olives, and further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that such sizing be done prior to pitting. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim final rule provides an alternative method for sizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whole pitted olives to provide handlers with more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility in their operations while ensuring that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate size standards are continued for whole pitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
olives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Standards provide a method for sizing whole pitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fruit on the basis of illustrations and approximate diameter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranges (section 52.3754, Table I). For example, olives that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are ``Jumbo'' in size are those that are approximately 22 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24 millimeters in diameter and conform closely with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable illustration in Table I. The committee believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this sizing method may be more appropriate for whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pitted olives, which now account for a substantial majority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the California olives packaged in the whole form. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule authorizes the sizing of whole pitted olives after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pitting in accordance with the illustrations and approximate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diameter ranges provided in the Standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Standards also provide allowances for size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variances for whole pitted olives in &sect;52.3756. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of U.S. Grade C (the minimum allowed under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order), provide that of the 60 percent, by count, of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
olives that are most uniform in size, the diameter of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largest olive cannot exceed the diameter of the smallest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
olive by more than 4 millimeters. These variances will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to whole pitted olives when handlers choose to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their pitted olives sized by diameter, after pitting. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee believes that these guidelines for sizing whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pitted olives are sufficient and that no additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications relating to size are needed at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide for this change in whole pitted olive sizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, paragraph (f) of &sect;932.152 is revised to add 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority for sizing by diameter as provided in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards. In addition, paragraph (b)(1) of &sect;932.152 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised by deleting the sentence which requires sizing prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pitting. Also, paragraph (b)(2) is revised to reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the elimination of the in-line inspection and sizing prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pitting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The outgoing regulations contain a table pertaining to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size certification of limited size olives for limited use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
styles at &sect;932.152(g)(1). In 1991, the committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended and the Secretary approved modifications in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sizes of limited use olives. While such modifications were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected elsewhere in the regulations, a conforming change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not made in Table II of &sect;932.152(g)(1). This rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrects the table, bringing it into conformance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules as they were modified in 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, olives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported into the United States are subject to comparable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size requirements as established for domestically grown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
olives under the order. Those requirements are found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Olive Regulation 1 [7 CFR 944.401]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the import regulation, canned pitted ripe olives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are subject to minimum size requirements in terms of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum diameter and a specific tolerance for undersized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fruit. The undersize tolerances set forth in the import 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation are based upon those established for canned whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
olives under the California olive marketing order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously explained, this interim final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes size requirements for canned pitted olives under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the order in terms of illustrations, approximate diameter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranges, and size variances which are set forth in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards. Thus, in accordance with section 8e of the Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conforming changes are made in the minimum size requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for imported canned pitted olives so that such requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are applied in a manner similar to that under the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that this rule will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matter presented, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including information and recommendations submitted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee and other available information, it is hereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of two interim
final rules that authorized expenditures and established assessment rates under Marketing Orders 948 and 953 for
the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period. Authorization of these budgets enables the Colorado Potato Administrative Committee,
Northern Colorado Office (Area III) and the Southeastern Potato Committee (Committees) to incur expenses that are
reasonable and necessary to administer the programs. Funds to administer these programs are derived from assessments
on handlers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is effective under Marketing Agreement No. 97 and Order No. 948, both as amended (7 CFR part 948), regulating
the handling of Irish potatoes grown in Colorado; and Marketing Agreement No. 104 and Order No. 953, both as amended
(7 CFR part 953), regulating the handling of Irish potatoes grown in Southeastern States (Virginia and North Carolina).
The marketing agreements and orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
(7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, Irish potatoes grown in Colorado and Virginia and North Carolina are subject to assessments. It is intended
that the assessment rates as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable Irish potatoes handled during the
1994&hyph;95 fiscal period, which began June 1, 1994, and ends May 31, 1995, for Southeastern potatoes and began July
1, 1994, and ends June 30, 1995, for Colorado potatoes. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order, is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS), has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 85 producers of Colorado Area III potatoes under the marketing order and approximately 15
handlers. Also, there are approximately 150 producers of Southeastern potatoes under the marketing order and approximately
60 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of the producers and handlers covered under these orders may
be classified as small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budgets of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period were prepared by the Committees, the agencies responsible
for local administration of their respective orders, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of
these Committees are producers and handlers of Colorado Area III and Virginia and North Carolina potatoes. They are
familiar with the Committees' needs and with the costs for goods and services in their local areas and are thus in a position
to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets were formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly
affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input into these processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recommended assessment rates were derived by dividing anticipated Committee expenses by expected respective
shipments of Colorado Area III and Virginia and North Carolina potatoes. Because these rates will be applied to actual
shipments of potatoes, the assessment rates must be established at levels that will provide sufficient income to
pay the Committees' expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Colorado Potato Administrative Committee, Northern Colorado Office (Area III) met on April 14, 1994, and unanimously
recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $24,325, $7,474 more than the previous year. Increases in the Federal portion
of the administrative budget include $200 for Committee meetings, $450 for Committee mileage, $50 for insurance
and bond, $2,860 for the manager's salary, $620 for medical insurance, $1,750 for office equipment, $500 for office
supplies, $219 for payroll taxes, $200 for telephone, $250 for miscellaneous, $125 for manager's expense, and $250
for Federal meetings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major expense item is $11,500 for the manager's salary. The actual salary will be $10,781.50, based on nine months
full-time work and three months at three-quarter time. An additional $718.50 was budgeted to have available and will
only be spent if the workload necessitates full-time work.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.02 per hundredweight, the same as last season.
This rate, when applied to anticipated potato shipments of 1,476,750 hundredweight, will yield $29,535 in assessment
income, which is adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal
period, estimated at $31,113, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of two fiscal periods' expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Colorado, both a State and a Federal marketing order operate simultaneously. The State order authorizes promotion,
including paid advertising, which the Federal order does not. All expenses in this category are financed under the
State order. The jointly operated programs consume about equal administrative time and the two orders continue to
split administrative costs equally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Southeastern Potato Committee met April 20, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $11,000,
the same as last year. Major expense items include $6,800 for Committee staff salaries and $900 for travel expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee also recommended an assessment rate of $0.0075 per hundredweight, $0.0025 less than last season's
rate. When the Committee met, planting for the 1994&hyph;95 crop season had not been completed. However, the manager
estimated shipments would generate about $7,000 in assessment income. This, along with funds from the Committee's
$15,000 reserve, will be adequate to cover the expenses incurred. Funds remaining at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal
period should be about the maximum permitted by the order of approximately one fiscal period's expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interim final rules were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 26, 1994, for 7 CFR part 948 (59 FR 27223) and 7 CFR part 953 (59 FR 27222). Those rules added &sect;948.211 and &sect;953.251
which authorized expenses, and established assessment rates for the Committees. Those rules provided that interested
persons could file comments through June 27, 1994. No comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived by the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing orders covered in this rulemaking are reasonable and likely
to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal periods for the programs began on June 1, 1994, for Southeastern potatoes and July
1, 1994, for Colorado Area III potatoes. The marketing orders require that the rates of assessment for the fiscal periods
apply to all assessable potatoes handled during the fiscal periods. In addition, handlers are aware of these actions
which were recommended by the Committees at public meetings and published in the

 This action establishes the quantity of Florida celery which handlers may ship to fresh markets during the 1994&hyph;95
marketing season at 6,712,910 crates or 100 percent of producers' base quantities. The 1994&hyph;95 marketing season
covers the period August 1, 1994, through July 31, 1995. This interim final rule is intended to lend stability to the
industry, and, thus, help provide consumers with an adequate supply of the product. As in past marketing seasons,
the limitation on the quantity of Florida celery handled for fresh shipment is not expected to restrict the quantity
of Florida celery actually produced or shipped to fresh markets, because production and shipments are anticipated
to be less than the marketable quantity. This action was unanimously recommended by the Florida Celery Committee
(Committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule establishes the quantity
of Florida celery (at 6,712,910 crates or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 percent of producers' base quantities) which handlers may ship to fresh markets during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing
season which covers the period August 1, 1994, through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 31, 1995. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an
irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately seven producers of celery in the production area and seven handlers of celery grown in Florida
subject to regulation under the celery marketing order. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small
Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural
service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of celery producers
and handlers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is based upon a recommendation and information submitted by the Committee and upon other available information.
The Committee met on June 15, 1994, and unanimously recommended a marketable quantity of 6,712,910 crates of fresh
celery for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing season beginning August 1, 1994. Additionally, a uniform percentage of 100
percent was recommended which will allow each producer, registered pursuant to section 967.37(f) of the order, to
market 100 percent of such producer's base quantity. These recommendations were based on an appraisal of expected
1994&hyph;95 supply and demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by section 967.37(d)(1) of the order, a reserve of 6 percent (402,775 crates) of the 1993&hyph;94 total
base quantities was made available to new producers and for increases for existing producers. The deadline for requesting
changes in base quantities was May 1, 1994. No applications for additional base quantities were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule will limit the quantity of Florida celery which handlers may purchase from producers and ship
to fresh markets during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing season to 6,712,910 crates. This marketable quantity is the same
as the 1993&hyph;94 marketable quantity, and is more than the average number of crates marketed fresh during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1987&hyph;88 through 1992&hyph;93 seasons. It is expected that such quantity will be more than actual shipments
for the 1994&hyph;95 season. Thus, the 6,712,910 crate marketable quantity is not expected to restrict the amount
of Florida celery which growers produce or the amount of celery which handlers ship. For these reasons, the interim
final rule should lend stability to the industry, and, thus, help provide consumers with an adequate supply of the
product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these considerations, the Administrator of AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available
information, is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impractical, unnecessary and contrary
to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists
for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) This action was recommended at a public meeting and all interested persons had an opportunity to express
their views and provide input; (2) it is desirable to have this action in place as soon as possible because celery planting
begins in July and the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 crop year is August 1, 1994; and (3) this rule provides a 30-day
comment period and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule which revised the administrative rules and regulations established under the Federal marketing order
for raisins produced from grapes grown in California. The interim final rule reapportioned the representation established
for independent and small cooperative marketing association handlers on the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee),
to provide more equitable representation. This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee, which
is responsible for local administration of the order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 989 [7 CFR Part 989], both as amended, regulating the handling
of raisins produced from grapes grown in California. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended, [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have any retroactive effect. This action will not preempt
any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the raisin marketing
order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of producers
and a minority of handlers of California raisins may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This rule finalizes an interim final rule which revised Section 989.126 of Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations
[7 CFR 989.102&hyph;989.176] and is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee and other available information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 26, 1994, [59 FR 27225], reapportioned the Committee representation established for independent and small
cooperative marketing association handlers on the Committee. The interim rule provided for broader independent
handler/small cooperative handler representation on the Committee to reflect the different handler segments in
the raisin industry. The change did not impose any additional regulatory, informational, or cost requirements on
handlers or producers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 989.26 of the order provides that the Committee shall consist of 47 members, of whom 35 shall represent producers,
10 shall represent handlers, 1 shall represent the cooperative bargaining association, and 1 shall be a public member.
The 10 handler positions are allocated between: (1) Cooperative marketing associations, each of which acquired
not less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year (referred to as major cooperative
handlers); and (2) independent handlers and small cooperative marketing associations; i.e., those who acquired
less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year. Currently, there is one cooperative
in group (1) engaged in handling raisins. That handler is allocated three positions on the Committee. Group (2) handlers
are allocated seven positions. The allocation of members between the two handler groups is based on the provisions
specified in paragraph (d) of &sect;989.26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 989.126(b) of the Administrative Rules and Regulations had previously provided for independent and small
cooperative handler representation on the Committee as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Two members selected from and representing the four handler(s) other than major cooperative handler(s) who acquired
the largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Two members selected from and representing the six handlers other than major cooperative marketing association
handler(s) who acquired the next largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year;
and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) The remaining member(s) selected from and representing all other handlers, including small cooperative marketing
association handler(s) and all processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of this final rule, category (1) is referred to as the ``large-sized handler'' group, category (2)
is referred to as the ``medium-sized handler'' group, and category (3) is referred to as the ``all other handler''
group. The number of handlers in the ``all other handler'' group has decreased from 10 to 7 since the 1990&hyph;91 crop
year. In addition, during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year, the ``medium-sized handler'' group acquired more than four
times the tonnage acquired by the ``all other handler'' group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this information, the Committee met on March 9, 1994, and unanimously recommended to move one handler position
from the ``all other handler'' group to the ``medium-sized handler'' group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule amended &sect;989.126(b) of the Administrative Rules and Regulations by changing the independent
and small cooperative handler representation on the Committee as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Two members selected from and representing the four handler(s) other than major cooperative handler(s) who acquired
the largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Three members selected from and representing the six handlers other than major cooperative marketing association
handler(s) who acquired the next largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The remaining member(s) selected from and representing all other handlers, including small cooperative marketing
association handler(s) and all processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The previous and current independent handler/small cooperative handler representation are shown as follows:

The shift in membership recognized the relative importance of the ``large-sized handler,'' ``medium-sized handler,''
and ``all other handler groups,'' and provides an opportunity for the ten largest independent/small cooperative
handlers to be represented on the Committee either as a member or as an alternate member. The ``all other handler''
group is eligible to nominate two members and two alternate members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended June 27, 1994. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's unanimous recommendation
and other available information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published
in the

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule establishes a separate brown rot tolerance for dried prunes produced in California and for dried prunes
imported into the United States. This rule specifies a separate tolerance of 3 percent for brown rot affected prunes,
within the combined tolerance allowance of 5 percent. The separate tolerance should benefit producers, handlers,
and consumers, and foster continued growth of the market for dried prunes. This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation
of the Prune Marketing Committee (Committee), which is responsible for local administration of the order. As provided
under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, a corresponding change is being made in the prune
import regulation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 993 [7 CFR Part 993], both as amended, hereinafter
referred to as the ``order'', regulating the handling of dried prunes produced in California. The marketing agreement
and order are authorized under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674],
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule, which also amends the prune import regulation (section 999.200), is also issued pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 8e of the Act. Section 8e provides that whenever certain specified commodities, including prunes, are regulated
under a Federal marketing order, imports of that commodity must meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality,
and maturity requirements as those in effect for the domestically produced commodity. Marketing order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 993, as amended [7 CFR Part 993] prescribes grade and size requirements for dried prunes produced in California.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his/her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this final rule on small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Import regulations issued under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders. Thus, they
also have small entity orientation, and impact both small and large business entities in a manner comparable to rules
issued under such marketing orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 20 handlers of dried prunes produced in California subject to regulation under the marketing
order, and approximately 1,360 producers in the regulated area. In addition, at least two importers of dried prunes
are subject to import regulations and will be affected by this action. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of handlers
and producers of California dried prunes may be classified as small entities. The majority of the importers of dried
prunes may also be classified as small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule revises &sect;993.601 of Subpart_Grade Regulations and is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee
and other available information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of &sect;993.49 of the marketing order provide the Secretary the authority to modify the minimum
standards for natural condition prunes received from producers and dehydrators (inbound inspection). Likewise,
paragraphs (a) and (b) of &sect;993.50 provide the Secretary authority for the modification of the minimum standards
for prunes that are shipped or otherwise disposed of by a handler (outbound inspection). Whenever a regulation is
established that increases grade requirements, it normally applies to both natural condition (unprocessed) prunes
and processed (cleaned or treated with water or steam) prunes. Minimum grade standards are specified under &sect;993.97
and have been modified in the rules and regulations under &sect;&sect;993.149 and 993.150.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current procedures for handling and scoring (inspecting) prunes, clusters of brown rot affected prunes are
removed from inbound samples during the initial grading process and are not scored against the lot. However, single
prunes affected with brown rot are often not removed during initial grading and are subsequently scored as defective
during inspection. For both incoming and outgoing prune inspections, the combined defect allowance, which includes
mold, imbedded dirt, insect infestation and decay, cannot exceed 5 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There has been a high incidence of brown rot infection in the 1992 and 1993 California prune crops. Brown rot is caused
by two closely related fungi in the blossoms and fruit of prunes and other stone fruits. Success of treatment varies,
making control of brown rot very difficult. Previously infected orchards are more susceptible to re-infection,
and, thus, a reoccurrence of brown rot in the 1994 prune crop is expected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Harvested prunes affected by brown rot cannot be marketed as prunes and, thus, have no value to handlers, since even
blending them with good prunes for the manufacture of prune products, such as prune juice and concentrate, yields
an unacceptable flavor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the expected high incidence of prunes affected by brown rot in the 1994 crop, the Committee met on December
8, 1993, and unanimously recommended establishing a separate defect tolerance of 3 percent for brown rot to be included
in the current 5 percent combined defects tolerance for mold, imbedded dirt, insect infestation and decay. Finally,
the Committee recommended that the new tolerance be applied to both inbound and outbound inspections. This rule will
have the effect of lowering the brown rot tolerance from the current maximum of 5 percent (assuming no other defects)
to a maximum of 3 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee believes the addition of specific brown rot tolerances will encourage growers to improve their cultural
practices to reduce the incidence of brown rot in their 1994 crops. In addition, notification of the new requirements
early in the growing season would provide growers with sufficient time to implement cultural practices that should
reduce the incidence of brown rot in their prunes. The California prune industry will benefit through increased sales,
which is expected to improve growers' returns. Handlers will benefit by paying for fewer prunes that have no value
and by lowering their sorting costs. Finally, this rule will result in a consistently higher quality product being
shipped, which will benefit consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This tolerance also applies to imported prunes. Section 8e of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality
or maturity requirements are in effect for dried prunes under a domestic marketing order, imported dried prunes must
meet the same or comparable requirements. Because this final rule establishes an additional tolerance for dried
prunes under the domestic handling regulation, a corresponding change to the import prune regulation [7 CFR part
999.200] is also included in this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee recommended that this rule become effective by early July 1994, to ensure that implementation be in
place by the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 crop year, which begins August 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule concerning this action was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 18, 1994, [59 FR 25841]. Comments on the proposed rule were invited from interested persons until June 17, 1994.
No comments were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all available information, it is found that the action, as hereinafter set forth, will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the United States Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of
this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date
of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) This action was unanimously recommended by the Committee; (2) the 1994&hyph;95 crop year begins August
1, 1994, and this rule should be effective promptly to cover as many of the 1994&hyph;95 season prunes as possible;
and (3) the proposed rule provided a 30-day comment period and no comments were received.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is establishing a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for television receiving
sets and compact disc players. The basis for a waiver for these classes of products is that there are no small business
manufacturers or processors available to supply them to the Federal Government. The effect of these waivers is to
allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract
set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA 8(a) Program for television receiving sets or compact disc
players.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 100&hyph;656, enacted on November 15, 1988, incorporated into the Small Business Act the previously existing
regulation that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses or the SBA 8(a) Program must provide
the products of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer
or processor. This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule. The SBA regulations which implement
this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.906(b) and 121.1106(b). Section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II), 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II),
provides for waiver of this requirement by SBA for any ``class of products'' for which there are no small business manufacturers
or processors available to participate in the Federal procurement market. To be considered available to participate
in the Federal procurement market on these classes of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted
a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal Government within the last 24 months.
The SBA defines ``class of products'' based on two coding systems. The first is the Office of Management and Budget
Standard Industrial Classification Manual, and the second is the Product and Service Code established by the Federal
Procurement Data System.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SBA was originally asked to process 15 class waivers of these Nonmanufacturer Rule, and sources were found for
all but these remaining two classes: (1) Television receiving sets and (2) compact disc players.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding television receiving sets, the SBA sought small business sources by contacting the General Services Administration's
Federal Supply Service in Fort Worth, Texas. The SBA also researched its Procurement Automated Source System (PASS)
and the Thomas Register. In addition, SBA published a notice seeking potential sources in the May 6, 1994, Commerce
Business Daily and an intent to grant a class waiver in the April 22, 1994,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 59 FR 19150. After a 15-day comment period, two comments were received received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both comments regarded the existence of a small business manufacturer of health care televisions. These televisions
are wall- or ceiling-mounted and are normally used in hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis facilities. Although
health care televisions may be purchased and used by individuals in their homes, these televisions are not normally
used in households for home entertainment. Two marketing firms for these televisions confirmed that these televisions
are not considered household items and are not marketed to individuals for home entertainment. After reviewing the
marketing information for health care televisions, it has become apparent that they are in a different category from
household television receiving sets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the absence of small business manufacturers, SBA is establishing a class waiver for television receiving
sets (SIC code 3651, PSC code 7730) pursuant to Section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv)(ii) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II).
The effect of this class waiver is to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic
manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA 8(a) Program for household
television receiving. This waiver will be in effect indefinitely, but is subject to review by SBA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding compact disc players, the SBA sought small business sources by contacting the General Services Administration's
Federal Supply Service in Fort Worth, Texas. The SBA also researched the PASS and the Thomas Register. In addition,
SBA published a notice seeking potential sources in the May 9, 1994, Commerce Business Daily and an intent to grant
a class waiver in the April 22, 1994,

Based on the absence of small business manufacturers, SBA is establishing a class waiver for compact disc players
(SIC code 3651, PSC code 7730) pursuant to the statutory authority cited above. The effect of this class waiver is to
allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract
set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA 8(a) Program for compact disc players. This waiver will be
in effect indefinitely, but is subject to review by SBA.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is establishing a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for office copiers.
The basis for a waiver for office copiers is that there are no small business manufacturers or processors available
to supply them to the Federal Government. The effect of this waiver is to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers
to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses or awarded
through the SBA 8(a) Program for office copiers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SBA was originally asked to process a request for a class waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for copiers. After
discussions with the General Services Administration's Office of Scientific Equipment Commodity Center, this
was modified to be copiers/duplicating equipment. The SBA then searched the Procurement Automated Source System
(PASS) and Thomas Register and published a notice seeking potential sources in the Commerce Business Daily. In addition,
SBA published a notice of intent to grant a class waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule in the March 15, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 59 FR 11938 (1994). After a 15-day comment period, two comments were received. Both comments regarded the existence
of a small business manufacturer of duplicators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment from a Federal agency informed SBA of the existence of a small business which manufactures office duplicators.
The second comment was from a small business manufacturer of spirit duplicators and stencil/mimeograph duplicators,
which they routinely provide to the Federal Government. Their duplicators use liquid ink and spirit fluid to produce
duplicates, and when compared with office copiers, their duplicators are slow and labor intensive. Due to their speed
and labor intensive nature, these duplicators tend to be marketed primarily to churches and schools, and are intended
for relatively low volume work. The firm's marketing representative informed SBA that these duplicators are not
in direct competition with office copiers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the marketing information for these duplicators, it became apparent that these products are in a
different category than office copiers. For these reasons, the class of products which is being waived from the Nonmanufacturer
Rule is more narrowly defined to include only office copiers. All types of duplicating equipment are excluded from
this class waiver.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above information, SBA is establishing a waiver for office copiers (SIC code 3579, PSC code 3610) pursuant
to Section 8(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 636(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II). The effect of this class
waiver is to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal
contract set aside for small businesses or awarded through the SBA 8(a) Program for office copiers. This waiver will
be in effect indefinitely, but is subject to periodic review by the SBA.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The first purpose of this document is to announce that the Small Business Administration (SBA) is terminating the
waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for: (1) Bars and rods, high nickel alloy, aluminum, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum,
copper, copper-nickel, aluminum-bronze, and naval brass; and (2) Structural shapes, angles, channels, tees and
zees, aluminum and high nickel alloy. The decision to terminate these waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule is based
on evidence provided to the SBA that there is a small business which manufactures items within these classes of products.
This small business is available to provide items within each class to the Federal government. Terminating these
waivers will require recipients of contracts set aside for small or 8(a) businesses to provide the products of domestic
small business manufacturers or processors where these classes of products are required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The second purpose of this document is to announce that SBA is retaining class waivers for: (1) Bars and rods, high nickel
alloy; (2) plate sheet, strip and foil, stainless steel and high nickel alloy; (3) wire, nonelectrical, high nickel
alloy; (4) plate, sheet and strip, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum, copper-nickel, and copper; and (5)
sheet and plate aluminum products. The effect of retaining these class waivers is that small businesses which receive
either small business set-aside or SBA 8(a) Program contracts for these products awards may provide the products
of any domestic manufacturer or processor.

Section 210 of Public Law 101&hyph;574 further amended the Small Business Act to allow for waivers for classes of products

Decision to terminate two class waivers:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. SBA announced its decision to grant a class waiver for bars and rods, high nickel alloy, aluminum, nickel-copper,
nickel-copper-aluminum, copper, copper-nickel, aluminum-bronze, and naval brass in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 15, 1991, 56 FR 22306. Recently, the Defense Logistics Agency's (DLA) Defense Industrial Supply Center (DISC)
brought to SBA's attention the existence of a small business manufacturer for items within this class of products.
Based on this information, a notice of the Agency's intent to terminate this waiver and waivers for six other classes
of products was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 10, 1994, 59 FR 1360. The notice allowed thirty days for a comment period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments received from the small businesses and DLA were similar to each other. They agreed that a small business
exists which manufactures items in this class of products. However, they believed they may not be able to supply all
of their potential procurement requirements with items manufactured by the small business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the SBA's published regulations, 58 FR 48954 (1993), ``(u)pon receipt by the SBA of evidence that a small
business manufacturer or processor exists in the Federal market for a waived class of products, the waiver shall be
terminated by the Associate Administrator for (Government Contracting).'' Based on this regulation, the SBA is
required to terminate the class waiver for this class of products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the waiver previously granted for bars and rods, high nickel alloy, aluminum, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum,
copper, copper-nickel, aluminum-bronze, and naval brass (Product and Service Code (PSC) 9530, Standard Industrial
Classification Code (SIC) 3356) is terminated, effective ninety days from the date of this notice. Small business
set-aside or SBA 8(a) Program contracts for this class of products may rely on this waiver where the solicitation is
dated before the ninetieth day after the date of the

The SBA originally announced its decision to grant class waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for these five classes
of products in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 15, 1991, 56 FR 22306. While researching SBA's Procurement Automated Source System (PASS) on a related issue,
SBA became aware of the possible existence of small business manufacturers for items within each of these classes
of products. After the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcement on January 10, 1994, of an intent to terminate these classes of products, the SBA received comments from
several small businesses and DLA regarding this matter. All parties urged that SBA not terminate waivers for these
five classes of products on the basis that doing so would adversely affect both the Federal procurement process for
these items and the existing suppliers for those products. Also, we learned that the production capabilities of the
small business manufacturers of these products is severely limited in quantity and product type. Based on these comments,
the SBA will retain the class waivers for these classes of products.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 1, 1994, SBA promulgated a final rule amending the size standard in 13 CFR 121.802 for its Surety Bond Guaranty
Program (59 FR 28231). The amended regulatory text was designated a paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;121.802. However,
in a previous amendment of &sect;121.802, which contains size standards for SBA financial assistance, SBA had promulgated
a new size standard for Small Business Investment Company assistance by dividing the text of paragraph (a)(2) into
two separate paragraphs, paragraph (a)(2) for development company assistance and paragraph (a)(3) for SBIC assistance,
and redesignating paragraph (a)(3), containing the size standard for surety bond guaranty assistance, as paragraph
(a)(4). When promulgating its final rule amending the surety bond guaranty size standard, however, SBA inadvertently
identified the amended regulatory text as paragraph (a)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42&hyph;300 and &hyph;320 series airplanes. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action requires an inspection to verify that the cables supplying power to the aileron trim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are adequately protected and to detect any damage to these cables. This amendment also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires installation of protective sleeves on unprotected cables, and replacement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damaged cables. This amendment is prompted by reports of a short circuit of these cables 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to worn protective sleeves. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short circuiting of the cables that supply power to the aileron trim, which could lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss of aileron trim control.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, recently notified the FAA that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42&hyph;300 and &hyph;320 series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes. The DGAC advises that the cables that supply power to the aileron trim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-circuited on an in-service airplane. Investigation revealed that the protective sleeve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on these cables was worn. Short circuiting of the cables that supply power to the aileron 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trim, if not corrected, could result in loss of aileron trim control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Avions de Transport Regional has issued Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0070, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 20, 1993, which describes procedures for visually inspecting to verify that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective sleeve on the cables that supply power to the aileron trim adequately protect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cables, and to detect damaged cables. This service bulletin also contains instructions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacing damaged cables with cables that have been modified in accordance with Avions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
de Transport Regional Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0014, Revision 2, dated December 20, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993. This latter service bulletin describes procedures for installation of protective sleeves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Modification A0014) on cables that are not adequately protected. The DGAC classified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these service bulletins as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;004&hyph;054(B), dated
January 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued to prevent loss of aileron trim control due to a short circuit in the cables that supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power to the aileron trim. This AD requires visually inspecting to verify that the cables 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that supply power to the aileron trim are adequately protected, and to detect damaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cables; replacing damaged cables with cables that have been previously modified; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installing protective sleeves on unprotected cables. The actions are required to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD applies only to airplanes having manufacturer's serial numbers 003 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through 072. For airplanes having manufacturer's serial numbers 073 and subsequent, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
glass fabric adhesive tape has been applied to the cables prior to delivery of the airplane; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, these airplanes are not subject to the unsafe condition addressed by this AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.

Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications

All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;99&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is amending Appendix A of CFTC rule 1.55(c)
adopted by the Commission on June 28, 1994, to identify the United Kingdom and Ireland as additional jurisdictions
whose relevant regulatory authorities have adopted the generic risk disclosure statement for specified products.
This order is issued pursuant to the Commission's recent rulemaking amending, among other provisions, CFTC rule
1.55(c), 59 FR 34376 (July 5, 1994), to permit registrants to deliver to customers a two-page generic risk disclosure
statement that may be used to satisfy the CFTC's risk disclosure requirements applicable to domestic and foreign
commodity futures and commodity options, and which also is intended to satisfy the risk disclosure requirements
of certain foreign jurisdictions. The Commission noted that it would on a periodic basis, update the listing of those
jurisdictions that accept the generic risk disclosure document as meeting specified disclosure requirements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On June 28, 1994 the Commission amended rules 1.55(c), 33.7(a) and 190.10(c) to permit registrants to deliver to customers
a generic risk disclosure statement contained in new Appendix A of CFTC rule 1.55(c), which satisfies risk disclosure
statement requirements contained in CFTC rules 1.55(b), 33.7(b) and 190.10(c) as well as the special disclosure
requirement related to futures-style margining of the options premium permitted on certain foreign exchanges.
As the generic statement was developed in cooperation with various international regulators and is intended to satisfy
the risk disclosure requirements of certain foreign jurisdictions who have implemented the language of this risk
disclosure statement in their jurisdictions in accordance with their domestic law, Appendix A specifies those jurisdictions
that permit the use of the generic risk disclosure statement and the products for which the statement may be used. The
CFTC noted that it would amend Appendix A on a periodic basis to provide updated information in this regard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of the generic risk disclosure statement in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the United Kingdom Securities and Futures Authority (``SFA'') and the Central Bank of Ireland (``CBI'') on July
11, 1994 confirmed the conclusion of applicable national procedures to permit the statement to be used to satisfy
relevant risk disclosure obligations within their jurisdictions. The generic risk disclosure statement addresses,
in the case of members of the United Kingdom SFA, commodity futures, options on commodity futures, options on commodities
and options on securities, and in the case of members of exchanges whose rules have been approved by the CBI, financial
futures and options on financial futures. Accordingly, the CFTC is amending Appendix A to reflect the addition of
the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland as jurisdictions in which the generic risk disclosure statement may be
used to satisfy relevant risk disclosure requirements for the products specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission is clarifying the entry for the United States in Appendix A to conform the text in the entry
to the text of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SmithKline Beecham Animal Health, 1600 Paoli Pike, West Chester, PA 19380, has informed FDA that it has transferred
ownership of, and all rights and interests in, approved NADA 065&hyph;488 to Walco International, Inc., 15 West Putnam,
Porterville, CA 93257. In addition, Walco has not previously been listed in 21 CFR 510.600(c)(1) as a sponsor of an
approved NADA. That section is amended to add entries for the firm. Furthermore, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 8, 1991, FDA published a document to reflect a change of sponsor from Beecham Animal Health (Drug labeler
code 000029) to SmithKline Beecham Animal Health (Drug labeler code 053571). The current 21 CFR 522.1696a(b)(1)
and (b)(2) does not reflect that change. This document removes the entry for Beecham in 21 CFR 522.1696a(b) and adds
in its place the entry for Walco International, Inc., the new sponsor. Accordingly, the agency is amending the regulations
in 21 CFR 510.600(c)(1) and (c)(2) and 21 CFR 522.1696a(b)(1) and (b)(2) to reflect those changes.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains final regulations regarding the place for filing a notice of tax lien against personal property.
Sections 1015(s)(1) (A) and (B) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (TAMRA), amended section 6323
of the Internal Revenue Code to provide that a state conforming to or reenacting a federal law establishing a national
filing system is not considered to have designated a second office for filing a notice of tax lien. TAMRA also amended
section 6323 to provide that the filing of a notice of federal tax lien is governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code
and is not subject to any other federal law that establishes a national filing system.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final regulations amend the Procedure and Administration Regulations (26 CFR part 301) under section 6323
of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The regulations reflect the amendment of section 6323 by sections 1015(s)(1)
(A) and (B) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;647, 102 Stat. 3573) (TAMRA).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 22, 1993, (58 FR 21550) providing proposed rules under section 6323 of the Code. No public comments were received
and accordingly, the final regulations are substantially identical to the proposed regulations. Certain minor
stylistic changes have been made.

Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1015(s)(1) (A) and (B) of TAMRA amended section 6323(f) of the Code by clarifying that a state's conformance
to or reenactment of a federal law establishing a national filing system for personal property does not constitute
a second office for filing in that state. The existing regulations provide that if a state has designated more than
one office for filing liens, the IRS must file the notice of tax lien with the clerk of the appropriate United States
district court. TAMRA also clarified that the filing of notices of liens by the IRS is to be governed solely by the Code
and is not subject to any other federal law establishing a national filing system.

, 56 B.R. 732 (S.D. Fla. 1985). In that case, the IRS filed its Notice of Federal Tax Lien with the clerk of the county circuit
court, but the court held that under section 6323(f)(1) the IRS was instead required to file its Notice of Federal Tax
Lien in the office of the clerk of the United States district court. The court found that the State of Florida had designated
not one, but two offices for the filing of Federal tax liens against personal property: The office of the clerk of the
circuit court of the county in which the personal property was located and, because the state had adopted the U.S. government's
national filing system for civil aircraft, the F.A.A.'s offices in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The final regulations
revise &sect;301.6323(f)&hyph;1 by providing that state law that conforms to or reenacts a federal law establishing
a national filing system does not constitute a second office for filing; by providing that the filing of liens is not
subject to federal laws (other than the Code) establishing a national filing system for liens; and by adding two examples,
one of which resembles the fact pattern of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.

A state law that conforms to or reenacts a federal law establishing a national filing system does not constitute a designation
by state law of an office for filing liens against personal property. Thus, if state law provides that a notice of lien
affecting personal property must be filed in the office of the county clerk for the county in which the taxpayer resides
and also adopts a federal law that requires a notice of lien to be filed in another location in order to attach to a specific
type of property, the state is considered to have designated only one office for the filing of the notice of lien, and
to protect its lien the Internal Revenue Service need only file its notice in the office of the county clerk for the county
in which the taxpayer resides.

(c) National filing system. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The filing of federal tax liens is to be governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code and is not subject to any other federal
law that may establish a national system for filing liens and encumbrances against a particular type of personal property.
Thus, for example, the Service is not subject to the requirements established by the Federal Aviation Agency for filing
liens against civil aircraft in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Example 5.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The law of State F provides that notices of lien affecting personal property are to be filed with the clerk of the circuit
court in the county in which the personal property is located. State F has conformed state law to federal law to provide
that all instruments affecting title to an interest in any civil aircraft of the United States must be recorded in the
Office of the Federal Aviation Administrator (FAA) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. On July 1, 1990, a tax lien arises against
ABC airline, which owns aircraft situated in State F. The Internal Revenue Service files a Notice of Federal Tax Lien
with the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which the aircraft is located but does not file the notice with the
FAA in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Because the FAA system adopted by State F does not constitute a second place of filing
pursuant to section 6323(f), the federal tax lien is validly filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 6.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Assume the same facts as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 5 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
except that State F did not reenact or conform state law to the FAA requirements. The result is the same because the filing
of federal tax liens is governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code, and is not subject to any other national filing
system.

This document clarifies the Final Rule published May 6, 1994 (59 FR 23637), regarding the redelegation of certain
functions and authority which were vested in the Attorney General by the Controlled Substances Act and subsequently
delegated to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. In that Final Rule, the Administrator redelegated
to the Deputy Administrator the authority to exercise all necessary functions under 21 CFR Part 1300 which have not
already been redelegated in subpart R of 28 CFR 0.104. This notice will serve to clarify that all functions under 21
CFR Parts 1300&hyph;1316 were delegated to the Deputy Administrator by the Final Rule published May 6, 1994.

OSM is approving a proposed amendment to the Indiana permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the
Indiana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment consists of
revisions to Indiana's Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Statutes concerning an exemption for operations conducted
under IC 13&hyph;4.1 (Indiana SMCRA) from the need for a ``construction in a floodway'' permit issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), Division of Water. The amendment is intended to consolidate and streamline
Indiana's permit system by implementing statutory changes contained in the 1993 Senate Enrolled ACT (SEA) 179.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated October 1, 1993 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1325), the IDNR submitted a proposed amendment
to the Indiana program concerning statutes enacted by Indiana under SEA 179 from the 1993 Indiana Legislative Session.
SEA 179 contains numerous amendments to the Indiana statutes, but only those which pertain to the Indiana program
are discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the May 5, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The comment period closed on June 6, 1994. On May 26, 1994 (59 FR 27251), OSM
corrected a typographical error in the May 5, 1994, proposed rule announcement.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendment to the Indiana program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
IC 13&hyph;4.1&hyph;4&blank;Permit Approval or Denial
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Indiana has amended subsection IC 13&hyph;4.1&hyph;4&hyph;3(a) concerning the findings required to be made by
the director of the IDNR prior to issuing a permit. New subdivision 3(a)(10) is added to provide as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) if any part of the operation would take place in a floodway (as defined in IC 13&hyph;2&hyph;22&hyph;3), the operation
will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) result in unreasonably detrimental effects upon the fish, wildlife, or botanical resources;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) adversely affect the efficiency; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its submittal of this amendment, Indiana explained that the proposed language quoted above is being added to the
Indiana program as a consequence of an amendment to IC 13&hyph;2&hyph;22&hyph;13. New subdivision 13(e)(3) is added
to IC 13&hyph;2&hyph;22&hyph;13 to provide that operations conducted under IC 13&hyph;4.1 (Indiana SMCRA) are
exempted from the need for a ``construction in a floodway'' permit issued by the IDNR, Division of Water. Instead,
any activity in a floodway which is to be conducted as part of an operation regulated under IC 13&hyph;4.1 must be identified
in the permit application to the Division of Reclamation. A determination must then be made by the Division of Reclamation
that the environmental standards identified in the proposed language are met. This determination will then become
part of the ``Findings Document'' which accompanies each of the Division's final permit recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no direct Federal counterpart in SMCRA or the Federal regulations to the proposed amendment. As explained
by Indiana in its submittal of this amendment, the purpose of this legislative change is to consolidate and streamline
the permit system as well as strengthen the technical review of the floodway permit work. Indiana further explained
that any disturbance on a mine site is part of a much larger effort already being reviewed by the Division of Reclamation.
Further, Indiana asserts that this change allows for a more thorough evaluation of the work when taken in context with
the overall plan of operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director finds that the proposed amendments are not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations. None
of the existing Indiana program provisions are rendered less effective by the inclusion of the proposed provisions
in the Indiana program. On the contrary, all of the approved provisions of the Indiana program remain in full effect.
Further, the proposed provisions are not inconsistent with SMCRA sections 503 concerning State programs, and 505
concerning State laws. Therefore, the Director is approving the amendment.

IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal Agency Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and 3 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various interested
Federal agencies. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) commented on the amendment (Administrative Record Number
IND&hyph;1378). The FWS stated that if the review of impacts to ``fish, wildlife, and botanical resources'' continues
to be administered by the IDNR's Division of Fish and Wildlife, or other trained fish and wildlife biologists, the
FWS assumes that the level of protection of fish and wildlife resources would not be changed from the current situation.
As discussed above in the Director's Findings, Indiana explained in its submittal that the proposed amendment should
strengthen the technical review of the floodway permit work since the review will become part of a much larger effort
already being conducted by the Division of Reclamation. The change, Indiana asserts, will allow for a more thorough
evaluation of the construction on a floodway. In his review of this amendment, the Director has concluded that none
of the existing Indiana program provisions are rendered less effective by the inclusion of the proposed provisions
in the Indiana program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FWS further stated that the FWS does not anticipate any impacts to Federally endangered/threatened species as
a result of the proposed revision. The Director concurs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 23176). The comment period closed on June 6, 1994. No one requested an opportunity to testify at the scheduled
public hearing so no hearing was held. No public comments were received in response to this amendment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the findings above, the Director is approving Indiana's program amendment concerning construction in a
floodway as submitted by Indiana on October 1, 1993. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 914 codifying decisions
concerning the Indiana program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective
immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into
conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required
by SMCRA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving proposed Program Amendment Number 67 to the Ohio permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred
to as the Ohio program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment was initiated
by Ohio and is intended to make the Ohio program as effective as the corresponding Federal regulations concerning
postmining land uses. Specifically, the amendment proposes to clearly identify postmining land use categories,
to clarify the comparison of premining and postmining land uses, to clarify that ``undeveloped land'' may be the designated
postmining land use only if the premining land use is undeveloped land, to clarify that ``forestland'' and ``fish
and wildlife habitat'' are distinct postmining land uses, and to eliminate redundant provisions more stringent
than the Federal regulations for notice and approval of alternative postmining land uses by other reviewing agencies
and for the design of postmining land use plans by an engineer.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated May 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2017), the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment Number 67. In this amendment, Ohio proposed
to revise one rule at Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17 to make the Ohio program as effective
as corresponding Federal regulations concerning postmining land uses. OSM announced receipt of proposed Program
Amendment Number 67 in the May 26, 1994,

on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on June 27, 1994.

III. Director's Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendment to the Ohio program. Revisions not specifically addressed below concern nonsubstantive
wording changes, or revised cross-references and paragraph notations to reflect organizational changes resulting
from this amendment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio is revising paragraphs (C) (1) through (11) to clarify the titles of the eleven approved postmining land use categories.
Since these are nonsubstantive changes, the Director finds that the revised State rules are no less effective than
their Federal counterparts at 30 CFR 701.5.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio is revising paragraph (B)(1) to clarify that the postmining land use for land that was mined pursuant to a license
issued prior to April 10, 1972, shall be judged on the basis of the highest and best use that can be achieved which is compatible
with surrounding areas and does not require the disturbance of areas previously unaffected by mining. The State's
proposed language is consistent with the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817/133(b). The Director,
therefore, finds that the revised State rule is no less effective than its Federal counterpart.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (B)(2) that, if the premining land use was changed within five
years of the beginning of mining, the postmining land use shall be compared to the historic use of the land as well as
its use immediately before mining. There are no Federal counterparts at 30 CFR 816/817.133. However, the State rule
at 1501:13&hyph;4&hyph;04(I)(1)(a) requires information on historical land use in permit applications if the
land use changed within five years before mining. This corresponds to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780.23(a)(1)
and 784.15(a)(1). Since the State rule at OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(B) states that ``[t]he premining uses of land
to which the postmining land uses are compared shall be those which the land previously supported *&blank;*&blank;*''
this would include historical land uses if the land use changed within five years before mining. Therefore, the Director
finds that the deletion of former paragraph (B)(2) will not render the Ohio program less effective than the Federal
regulations.

OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(B)(2), Undeveloped land use. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio is adding a new requirement in paragraph (B)(2) that land may be returned to the undeveloped postmining land use
category only if the land was categorized as undeveloped prior to mining. Ohio's proposed rule clarifies that undeveloped
land may be the designated postmining land use only if the premining land use is undeveloped land. The Director finds
that the proposed rule is not inconsistent with and is no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.133(b)
and 30 CFR 701.5.

OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(C), Undeveloped land use

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Ohio is revising paragraph (C) to require that all proposed changes of land use, including changes from undeveloped
land to forestland or fish and wildlife habitat, shall be considered an alternative land use change subject to approval
by the Chief of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (the Chief). The Director finds
that Ohio's proposed rule is not inconsistent with and is not less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR
816/817.133 and the Federal definition of ``land use'' at 30 CFR 701.5.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(8) that plans to change the postmining land use to undeveloped
land from some other land use category must treat the land as if the postmining land use were in the forestland/fish
and wildlife habitat category. The proposed deletion of this paragraph is consistent with revised paragraphs (B)(2)
and (C) which clarify that undeveloped land may be the designated postmining land use only if the premining land use
is undeveloped land. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed deletion of paragraph (D)(8) will not render
the Ohio rule less effective than the Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Ohio is revising paragraphs (C)(9) and (C)(10) to clarify that ``forestland'' and ``fish and wildlife habitat''
are distinct postmining land uses. The ``forest'' category includes land used for commercial or noncommercial production
of wood or wood products. The Director finds that the revised rules are no less effective than the Federal regulations
at 30 CFR 816/817.133 and the corresponding Federal definitions at 30 CFR 701.5.

OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(D)(1), Agency review of postmining land uses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(1) that requests for alternative postmining land use
must contain a written statement of views from the authorities having statutory responsibilities for land use policies
and plans. Ohio is also deleting the requirement in paragraph (D)(1) that the operator must obtain any required approval
of the final land use from local, State, or Federal land management agencies, including any necessary zoning or other
required changes. The counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.133(c) impose no similar requirements.
Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of these requirements will not render the Ohio program less effective
than the Federal regulations.

OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17(D)(6), Agency review of postmining land uses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Ohio is revising paragraph (D)(6) to clarify that, for approval by the Chief, proposed alternative postmining land
uses must identify measures to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on fish and wildlife and on threatened or endangered
plants or animals or their critical habitats and must demonstrate that an opportunity to comment has been provided
in accordance with OAC section 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;11 to appropriate State and Federal fish and wildlife management
agencies. There are no Federal counterparts at 30&hyph;CFR 816/817.133. Therefore, the Director finds that the
revisions do not render the Ohio program less effective than the Federal regulations.

. Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(9) that alternative postmining land use plans must demonstrate
that the operator has provided written notice of the proposed land use to appropriate State and Federal agencies with
instructions for those agencies to provide any comments on the proposed land use to the Chief. The Federal requirements
at 30 CFR 816/817.133 do not impose a similar requirement. Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of this
requirement will not render the Ohio program less effective than the Federal regulations.

. Ohio is deleting the existing requirement at paragraph (D)(2) that postmining land use plans must be designed under

requirements at 30 CFR 816/817.133. The Director, therefore, finds that the deletion of paragraph (D)(2) will not

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing
was held.

Federal Agency Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal
agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Ohio program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, stated that it does not recommend that any forestland
be grazed as indicated in paragraph (C)(3) of OAC 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17. The only change proposed by Ohio at paragraph
(C)(3) was to clarify the title of the approved postmining land use. Therefore, the Director will not address this
comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No other comments were received.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the EPA with respect
to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the
authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). None of the revisions that Ohio proposed to make in this amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore,
OSM did not request EPA's concurrence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (Administrative
Record No. OH&hyph;1993). The EPA responded on June 20, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2030), that it reviewed
the proposed amendment but had no comments.

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed program amendment as submitted by Ohio on May 17, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 935 codifying decisions concerning the Ohio program are being amended to implement
this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process
and to encourage States to conform their programs with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of
State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

VI. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order No. 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Management
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements
of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731 and 732 have been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements which require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding Federal
regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 10, 1994 (59 FR 24100), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that Texaco Chemical Co., P.O. Box 27707, Houston,
TX 77227-7707, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 2E4191 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant
to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(d)
by amending the current exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of diethylene glycol by expanding
its use as an inert ingredient, to read ``deactivator, adjuvant for formulations used before crop emerges from the
soil.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the amended tolerance exemption will
protect the public health. Therefore, the amended tolerance exemption is established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has adopted rules to implement the provisions of the Telecommunications Authorizations Act of 1992,
which created a new section 4(g)(3) of the Communications Act that authorizes the Commission to accept unconditional
gifts, donations and bequests in furtherance of its functions. The Commission has ensured that its rules are consistent
with the directive in section 4(g)(3) to promulgate implementing regulations that ``include provisions to preclude
the acceptance of any gift, bequest or donation that would create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict
of interest.'' These regulations will promote the performance of the Commission's regulatory functions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

1. This is a summary of the Report and Order (R&amp;O) in GC Docket 93&hyph;153, adopted June 24, 1994 and released July
22, 1994. The full text of this document is available for inspection and copying Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 4:30
p.m. in the FCC Dockets Reference Room (Room 239), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554, and may be purchased from

2. The purpose of this R&amp;O is to implement the conflict of interest restrictions in section 4(g)(3) of the Communications
Act, which authorizes the Commission to accept unconditional gifts, donations and bequests. In order to develop
implementing regulations, the Commission looked for guidance to the policies of other agencies that have statutory
gift acceptance authority, the provisions of the new Office of Government Ethics (OGE) government-wide standards
of employee conduct, and General Services Administration (GSA) regulations implementing agency acceptance of
travel reimbursement. The Commission requested commenters to submit alternative proposals. None of the parties
who filed comments in this proceeding endorsed an absolute ban on the acceptance of gifts from Commission regulatees.
As discussed in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), 58 FR 34405 (1994), and as also pointed out by commenters,
we continue to believe that imposing such an absolute ban would exclude a vast number of potential donors, and those
who may be the most likely donors of equipment or other services that would be useful to the Commission in achieving
more efficient performance of its regulatory functions. In addition, as discussed in our NPRM, gifts to agencies
do not necessarily involve the same type or degree of conflicts or appearance concerns as those of personal gifts made
to employees with decisionmaking responsibility_the focus of most traditional conflict of interest regulations,
such as the OGE government-wide standards of employee conduct. In the NPRM, we concluded that, in the context of agency
gift acceptance, more flexible approaches could be used. Commenters agreed with the conclusion reached in our NPRM
that less restrictive policies can be formulated which adequately address conflict of interest concerns. Accordingly,
the Commission has decided to reject an absolute ban on gifts from regulated entities and to construe section 4(g)(3)
in a flexible manner that will better achieve its statutory objective and promote the performance of the Commission's
regulatory functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 4(g)(3), unlike some agency gift acceptance statutes, expressly limits the Commission's gift acceptance
authority to gifts that are ``unconditional.'' This statutory restriction effectively precludes gifts that are
made contingent on official action. To guard against any potential that official action could be influenced by gifts,
we have determined that it is critical to ensure that the section 4(g)(3) prohibition on conditional gifts is carefully
and scrupulously observed. The regulations adopted in this Order contain certain structural safeguards and absolute
prohibitions designed to avoid both conflict of interest concerns and appearance concerns. In addition, the regulations
impose mandatory factors that authorized agency ethics officials must consider in determining whether conflicts
or appearance problems exist. Finally, the regulations contain public disclosure and reporting requirements that
are intended to minimize or eliminate appearance problems. We believe that these mechanisms work together effectively
to eliminate the conflicts of interest and appearance concerns. In order to insulate agency officials with programmatic
responsibilities, insofar as possible, from involvement in determinations regarding gift acceptance or discussions
with potential donors regarding gifts, we are requiring potential donors and Commission employees who receive gift
overtures to refer such matters to the Commission's designated agency ethics official. We also are imposing an absolute
bar on agency solicitation of gifts from regulated entities and others identified as prohibited sources under the
new OGE standards of conduct. We are requiring that all monetary gifts be made by check rather than in cash. Further,
because we think that conflicts of interest and appearance problems may be greatest when the gifts made to the agency
appear to enure more to the personal benefit of employees, we have decided that certain types of gifts should be prohibited
altogether, e.g., food and drink which would continue to be governed by the OGE standards of conduct or other independent
authority.

4. We have also decided not to accept under section 4(g)(3) gifts of travel expenses for attendance at meetings that
are governed by the regulations implementing 31 U.S.C. 1353, the government-wide travel reimbursement statute.
The GSA rules implementing section 1353 prohibit agencies from using general gift acceptance statutes to accept
travel reimbursement for attendance at meetings that are covered by that section. As we noted in the NPRM, however,
GSA's rules implementing 1353 do not govern the acceptance of travel and related expenses for attendance at, or participation
in, meetings or events that are required to carry out an agency's statutory or regulatory functions. We agree with
commenters that there are substantial public interest benefits to be gained by employees' attendance at, or participation
in, certain government sponsored meetings or events (such as international coordination meetings provided for
by treaty). Thus, to the extent that attendance at, or participation in, government sponsored meetings or events
are deemed outside the scope of 1353 coverage (because the meetings are required in order to carry out statutory or
regulatory functions) we will permit the acceptance of travel reimbursement for them under section 4(g)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Commission has established the imposition of mandatory factors that Commission officials must consider in
determining whether conflicts or appearance problems may exist. Where gifts are offered by a regulated entity, we
will require officials making conflict of interest determinations to evaluate at the outset the extent to which benefits
of the gift might accrue to individual employees. If the gift does benefit an individual employee, agency officials
shall consider whether that employee is responsible for matters affecting the potential donor that are currently
pending before the agency and the significance of the employee's role in such matters. Whether or not the proposed
gift benefits employees personally, we will consider: the nature and sensitivity of any matters pending at the Commission
affecting the regulated source and the timing of the gift; the market value of the gift; and the frequency of gifts made
by a particular donor. Finally, we have adopted public disclosure and reporting requirements that are intended to
minimize or eliminate appearance problems. The Commission will keep a detailed record of all gifts accepted from
prohibited sources and make the following information publicly available concerning gifts that are accepted: the
identity of the prohibited source; a description of the gift; market value of the gift; documentation concerning
the prohibited source's reason for the gift; a verification from the prohibited source that the gift is unconditional
(not contingent on any promise or expectation that the Commission's receipt of the gift will benefit the donor in any
regulatory matter); and the date the gift is accepted by the Commission. The Commission shall file a semi-annual report
to Congress listing the gift, donor, and value of all gifts accepted from any donor under section 4(g)(3) authority.

6. We believe that, as mandated by section 4(g)(3) of the Communications Act, the regulations adopted here will preclude
real and apparent conflicts of interest when the Commission exercises its new gift acceptance authority. In order
to ensure the integrity of our process, we have, as discussed above, adopted numerous safeguards which will require
careful consideration of conflicts of interest issues by impartial agency ethics officials. Our rules will also
ensure that our actions implementing this authority are exposed to the fullest possible public and congressional
scrutiny.

The purpose of this subpart is to implement the Telecommunications Authorization Act of 1992 which amended the Communications
Act by creating section 4(g)(3), 47 U.S.C. 154(g)(3). The provisions of this subpart shall apply to gifts, donations
and bequests made to the Commission itself. Travel reimbursement for attendance at, or participation in, government-sponsored
meetings or events required to carry out the Commission's statutory or regulatory functions may also be accepted
under this subpart. The acceptance of gifts by Commission employees, most notably gifts of food, drink and entertainment,
is governed by the government-wide standards of employee conduct established at 5 CFR part 2635. Travel, subsistence
and related expenses for non-government-sponsored meetings or events will continue to be accepted pursuant to the
Government Employees Training Act, 41 U.S.C. 4111 or 31 U.S.C. 1353, and its General Services Administration's implementing
regulations, 41 CFR 304&hyph;1.8, as applicable.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, on its own motion, amends the Table of FM Allotments to specify the correct classes of channels allotted
to various communities. These amendments are necessary to reflect changes that have been authorized in response
to applications filed by licensees and permittees operating on these channels. This action constitutes an editorial
change in the Table of Allotments. Therefore, a public notice and comment proceeding is unnecessary. See 5 U.S.C.
553(b) (A) and (B). With this action, this proceeding is terminated.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current policy contained in NASA FAR Supplement &sect;1819.505 (c), (d), and (e) addresses situations in which a
small business set-aside is not initiated or pursued. In NFS &sect;1819.505(c), if the contracting officer disapproves
the Small Business Specialist's set-aside recommendation, the contracting officer shall promptly refer the case
to the SBA representative (if one is assigned and available) for review. In NFS &sect;1819.505(d), cases involving
the non-initiation of a set-aside require referral to the SBA representative (if one is assigned and available) for
review. NFS &sect;1819.505(e) addresses the situation when an SBA representative is not assigned or available,
and the contracting officer disagrees with the Small Business Specialist's recommendation on a small business set-aside,
or withdrawal or modification of a set-aside determination. The Small Business Specialist may make a written appeal
to the center procurement officer whose decision may overrule the Small Business Specialist's recommendation.
Upon later review of this action, SBA may disagree with the procurement officer's decision not to set aside a procurement
for small business and may appeal the decision. If SBA does pursue an appeal in the situations described in NFS &sect;1819.505
(c), (d), or (e), the Office of Procurement at NASA Headquarters wants the NASA center to notify them in writing as soon
as SBA appeals the procurement officer's decision.

approving the contracting officer's determination described in 1819.505(e), SBA may disagree with the procurement
officer's decision not to set aside a procurement for small business. If the SBA appeals the procurement officer's
decision, Code H should be notified in writing as soon as SBA appeals this decision. This notification should include
a history of the center and SBA discussions on the procurement as well as any actions the center has taken.

NASA FAR Supplement (NFS) 1842.801(a) requires the contracting officer to take action after receipt of a NASA Form
456, Notice of Contract Costs Suspended or Disapproved, or a DCAA Form 1, Notice of Costs Suspended and/or Disapproved
under Cost Reimbursement Contracts. However, when more than one contract is cited on the notice, the NFS does not specify
which contracting officer has responsibility for the action. NFS 1842.801 is changed to clarify that the contracting
officer with the most dollars affected is responsible for coordination with the other affected contracting officers,
including those of other federal agencies. The cross-reference at 1842.801(b) is also revised to identify the correct
cite. In addition, 1853.242&hyph;72 is revised to include the correct prescription cite. Other minor changes have
also been made for efficiency or clarification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Return the unsigned NASA Form 456 to the auditor with a detailed explanation of why the suspension or disapproval
is not being countersigned, and process the contractor's claim for payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When more than one NASA contract is affected by a notice, the NASA contracting officer with the largest amount of

officers, including those of other federal agencies, listed in the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The NASA contracting officer, when in agreement with the NASA Form 456 initiated by the auditor, shall assign a
notice number and shall countersign the form. An original and three copies (which includes two acknowledgement copies,
one each for return to the contracting officer and the auditor) of the form shall be sent to the contractor by certified
mail, return receipt requested; one copy shall be attached to the Standard Form 1034 and each copy of the Standard Form
1034A (see 1842.7101(c)) on which the deduction for the suspension/disapproval is made, and one copy shall be sent
to the auditor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The total amount suspended or disapproved, as shown on the NASA Form 456, shall be inserted in the Differences block
of the Standard Form 1034 and 1034A, citing the applicable NASA Form 456. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e)(1) If the amount of the deduction is more than the amount of the public voucher, the installment method of deduction
shall be applied to the current and subsequent public vouchers until the amount is fully liquidated. The deductions
on any voucher may not exceed the voucher amount to avoid processing of a voucher in a credit amount. Public voucher(s)
with zero amounts must be forwarded to the fiscal or financial management office for appropriate action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If deductions are in excess of contractor claims, recovery may be made through a direct refund from the contractor,
in the form of a check payable to NASA, or by a set-off deduction from the voucher(s) submitted by the contractor under
any other contract, unless those contracts contain a ``no set-off'' provision. If a set-off is affected, the voucher(s)
from which the deduction is made should be annotated to identify the contract and appropriation affected and the applicable
NASA Form 456.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS implements regulations for several management measures to prevent certain Gulf of Alaska (GOA) trawl fisheries
from taking an unnecessarily large share of the GOA halibut bycatch limit; amend the directed fishing standards to
prohibit using retained amounts of arrowtooth flounder, or groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing,
as a basis for calculating retainable amounts of other, more valuable groundfish species that are closed to directed
fishing; change the opening date of the yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian
Islands management area (BSAI) from May 1 to January 1; and implement changes pertaining to the annual specification
and management of GOA halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits. This action is necessary to reduce the likelihood
that one sector of the Alaska trawl fleet will preempt others for a share of the Pacific halibut bycatch limit established
for vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, and provide greater opportunity to harvest available groundfish under halibut
bycatch restrictions in both the GOA and BSAI fisheries. This action is intended to further the objectives of the fishery
management plans for the groundfish fisheries off Alaska.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The domestic groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the GOA and the BSAI are managed by the Secretary
of Commerce in accordance with the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish
Fishery of the BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Regulations authorized under the FMP that pertain to the
U.S. groundfish fisheries appear at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing regulations provide a framework process for the annual specification of GOA halibut PSC limits for trawl
and fixed gear fisheries and for apportioning these limits by season. Although these regulations limit the bycatch
of Pacific halibut in the GOA groundfish trawl fisheries, they have resulted in conflict among and preemption of groundfish
trawling operations in the GOA as different trawl fishery components compete for shares of the available halibut
PSC limit. This results in the attainment of the halibut bycatch cap before some groundfish Total Allowable Catch
(TAC) limits have been taken, causing a closure of trawling operations in the GOA, even though the full groundfish
harvest amount has not been taken in some fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule implements the following three measures to address the preemption of one trawl fishery sector by another.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Establish two GOA trawl fishery categories for the purpose of apportioning the GOA halibut bycatch limit already
established for the trawl gear fisheries (&sect;672.20 (f)). These two categories are the following: (1) The shallow-water
fishery complex (pollock, Pacific cod, Atka mackerel, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, and ``other species'');
and (2) the deep-water fishery complex (the deep-water flatfish, rex sole, arrowtooth flounder, sablefish, and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Revise the method for calculating retainable amounts of groundfish species under directed fishing standards
(&sect;672.20(h) and &sect;675.20(i)). Revised methods prohibit using retained amounts of arrowtooth flounder,
or groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing, as a basis for calculating retainable amounts of other,
more valuable groundfish species that are closed to directed fishing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Adjust the opening date for the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``other flatfish'' fisheries from May 1 to January 1. As a
result of this season adjustment, directed fishing standards governing retainable amounts of flatfish species
at &sect;675.20(h)(2) also are revised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule also implements editorial changes to regulatory language pertaining to the annual specification
and management of GOA halibut PSC limits. In addition, NMFS apportions the 1994 GOA halibut trawl PSC limit among fisheries
and seasons as set out below:

An emergency rule implementing these measures was published on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6222), under section 305(c)
of the Magnuson Act. At its April 1994 meeting the Council voted to extend the emergency rule for another 90 days (59
FR 24965, May 13, 1994). A proposed rule to implement these measures was published in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 4, 1994 (59 FR 23044). A complete description of, and justification for, the management measures, including
editorial changes to regulations addressing GOA halibut bycatch amounts, was discussed in the preamble to the proposed
rule. Additional information also is available in the EA/RIR (see

Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Splitting the halibut bycatch limit between the shallow-water fishery complex and the deep-water fishery complex
splits the limit between a well-observed fleet with 100-percent observer coverage (mainly in the deep-water fisheries)
and a poorly observed fleet with 30-percent observer coverage (mainly in the shallow-water fisheries). Because
the 30-percent boats have greater latitude to take an observer, the bycatch data collected for the shallow-water
fisheries would be biased and, therefore, less accurate than the data collected for the deep-water fisheries, thus
jeopardizing the management of the halibut bycatch limits. This action would degrade the scientific basis for halibut
bycatch management and is contrary to national standard 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with national standard 2, NMFS continues to monitor the groundfish fishery using the best information
available. Opportunities do exist in the 30-percent observer coverage fleet for vessel operators to manipulate
observer coverage to reduce or increase coverage in different fisheries. However, NMFS has taken measures to increase
observer coverage in the groundfish fleet to improve the accuracy of catch monitoring. A recent amendment to the Observer
Plan (59 FR 22133, April 29, 1994) changed observer coverage requirements for vessels required to obtain 30-percent
observer coverage. The amendment to the Observer Plan limits the manipulation of observer coverage by requiring
vessels to carry an observer during at least 30 percent of their fishing days in each calendar quarter in which the vessels
participate for more than 3 fishing days in a directed fishery for groundfish. These vessels are also required to have
an observer on board the vessel during one trip in each fishery, as defined in the Observer Plan amendment, in which
they participate. These measures should reduce the potential for manipulation of observer coverage and increase
the amount of observer data available for the management of the specific fisheries.

Comment 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Processors are not required to report harvests such that NMFS can reasonably attribute shoreside catch to a given
target with its appropriate bycatch. Currently, one target species is assigned per week, even though vessels delivering
to a plant may have targeted several different species. This system cannot be used to monitor scientifically a separate
shallow-water fisheries halibut bycatch limit and is inconsistent with national standard 2.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: For purposes of attributing halibut bycatch, NMFS assigns a target fishery based on maximum retained amounts (except
midwater pollock, for which pollock must comprise 95 percent or more of the total catch) and estimates halibut bycatch
for each unique combination of processor, gear type, and reporting area, on a weekly basis. Halibut bycatch is attributed
to one of the two fishery categories for which a trawl halibut bycatch allowance is made. Bycatch from the bottom pollock,
Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel, or ``other species'' fisheries is attributed
to the shallow-water species complex. Bycatch from the sablefish, rockfish, deep-water flatfish, and arrowtooth
flounder fisheries is attributed to the deep-water species complex. NMFS does not have the ability to assign target
fisheries based on vessel hauls or individual vessel deliveries. Given this procedure, NMFS does monitor bycatch
consistent with the intent of the regulations and based on the best available scientific information.

Changes in the Final Rule From the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule includes one editorial change in &sect;672.20(f)(3)(i) to clarify an inconsistency with respect
to paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of the same section. Section (f)(1)(iv) provides the authority to establish a separate halibut
PSC allowance by regulatory area and district; however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;672.20(f)(3)(i) does not provide the authority for closures based on regulatory area or district once an allowance
is reached. Language has been added to paragraph &sect;672.20(f)(3)(i) to indicate that, upon attainment of a bycatch
allowance for the entire Gulf of Alaska or the applicable regulatory area or district, a closure would be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon reviewing the reasons for, and the comments on, this action, NMFS has determined that this rule is necessary for
fishery conservation and management.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that this rule,
if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The reasons were
published in the preamble to the proposed rule (59 FR 24965, May 5, 1994). As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis
was not prepared. NMFS prepared an analysis of the economic impact on small entities as part of the EA/RIR. A copy of
the EA/RIR is available from NMFS (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has determined that delaying the effectiveness of this final rule for the entire 30 days under the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(d), is contrary to the public interest in orderly conduct of the fisheries in the EEZ. This
rule supersedes the original emergency rule implementing these measures which expires August 9, 1994. The fishery
has been operating under the emergency rule with a benefit to the fishery. To avoid an interruption in the fishery as
it is currently being conducted under the emergency rule, NMFS is waiving a portion of the 30-day delayed effectiveness
period for this rule to correspond with the expiration of the emergency rule.

, allow some or all of those vessels to continue to fish for groundfish using nonpelagic trawl gear under specified
conditions, subject to the other provisions of this part. In authorizing and conditioning such continued fishing
with bottom-trawl gear, the Regional Director will take into account the following considerations, and issue relevant
findings: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The risk of biological harm to halibut stocks and of socio-economic harm to authorized halibut users posed by continued
bottom trawling by these vessels; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The extent to which these vessels have avoided incidental halibut catches up to that point in the year;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The confidence of the Regional Director in the accuracy of the estimates of incidental halibut catches by these
vessels up to that point in the year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Whether observer coverage of these vessels is sufficient to assure adherence to the prescribed conditions and
to alert the Regional Director to increases in their incidental halibut catches; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The enforcement record of owners and operators of these vessels, and the confidence of the Regional Director that
adherence to the prescribed conditions can be assured in light of available enforcement resources.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule revises 32 CFR Part 516, Litigation, Army Regulation 27&hyph;40, Litigation, previously published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a proposed rule (57 FR 31852). This rule devotes a separate subpart to service of process (subpart B). The former
``investigative report'' is replaced by ``litigation report'' reflecting current usage (subpart C). A separate
subpart is devoted to individual liability (subpart D). This rule also treats environmental litigation (subpart
F), deletes coverage of criminal prosecutions in U.S. Magistrate and District Courts, delegates more authority
to the installation level to determine release of information and appearance of witnesses (subpart G); and updates
procedures to obtain release from local or state jury duty (subpart J).

(a) Defined. Process is a legal document that compels a defendant in an action to appear in court or to comply with the
court's demands, for example, in a civil case a summons or subpoena, or in a criminal case, a warrant for arrest, indictment,
contempt order, subpoena, or summons. Service of process is the delivery of the document to a defendant to notify him
of a claim or charge against him.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Policy. DA personnel will follow the guidance of this chapter when civil officials attempt to serve civil or criminal
process on individuals on Federal property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Procedures. Provost marshals shall ensure that installation law enforcement personnel are adequately trained
to respond to situations which arise with regard to service of civil and criminal process. SJAs or legal advisers shall
provide guidance to law enforcement personnel in these matters.

(a) Surrender of personnel. Guidance for surrender of military personnel to civilian law enforcement officials
is in Chapter 7 of AR 630&hyph;10 and AR l90&hyph;9. Army officials will cooperate with civilian law enforcement authorities
who seek the surrender of a soldier in connection with criminal charges. Special rules apply when a bail bondsman or

Service of civil process within the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Policy. DA officials will not prevent or evade the service or process in legal actions brought against the United
States or against themselves in their official capacities. If acceptance of service of process would interfere with
the performance of military duties, Army officials may designate a representative to accept service. DA personnel
sued in their individual capacity should seek legal counsel concerning voluntary acceptance of process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Requests for witnesses or evidence in civil proceedings. See subpart H to this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Process of Federal courts. Subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the commander, civil officials will
be permitted to serve Federal process. (See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4, 45).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Process of state courts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In areas of exclusive Federal jurisdiction that are not subject to the right to serve state process, the commander
or supervisor will determine whether the individual to be served wishes to accept service voluntarily. A JA or other
DA attorney will inform the individual of the legal effect of voluntary acceptance. If the individual does not desire
to accept service, the party requesting service will be notified that the nature of the exclusive Federal jurisdiction
precludes service by state authorities on the military installation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On Federal property where the right to serve process is reserved by or granted to the state, in areas of concurrent
jurisdiction, or where the United States has only a proprietary interest, Army officials asked to facilitate service
of process will initially proceed as provided in the preceding subparagraph. If the individual declines to accept
service, the requesting party will be allowed to serve the process in accordance with applicable state law, subject
to reasonable restrictions imposed by the commander.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Process of foreign courts. A U.S. District Court may order service upon a person who resides in the judicial district
of any document issued in connection with a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal. (28 U.S.C. 1696). In
addition, the U.S. State Department has the power to receive a letter rogatory issued by a foreign or international
tribunal, to transmit it to a tribunal, officer or agency in the United States, and to return it after execution. (28
U.S.C. 1781). Absent a treaty or agreement to the contrary, these provisions will govern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Seizure of personal property. State and Federal courts issue orders (for example, writ of attachment) authorizing
a levy (seizure) of property to secure satisfaction of a judgment. DA personnel will comply with valid state or Federal
court orders commanding or authorizing the seizure of private property to the same extent that state or Federal process
is served.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Process of foreign courts. In foreign countries service of process issued by foreign courts will be made under
the law of the place of service, as modified by status of forces agreements, treaties or other agreements. In foreign
areas under exclusive U.S. jurisdiction, service of process issued by foreign courts will be made under the law specified
by appropriate U.S. authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Process of Federal courts. Service of process on U.S. citizens or residents may be accomplished under the following
provisions: The Hague Convention, reprinted in 28 USCA Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, following Rule 4; Fed. R.
Civ. P. 4(i); 28 USC 1781 and 1783; and, the rules of the Federal court concerned. If a DA official receives a request
to serve Federal process on a person overseas, he will determine if the individual wishes to accept service voluntarily.
Individuals will be permitted to seek counsel. If the person will not accept service voluntarily, the party requesting
service will be notified and advised to follow procedures prescribed by the law of the foreign country concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Process of state courts. If a DA official receives a request to serve state court process on a person overseas, he
will determine if the individual wishes to accept service voluntarily. Individuals will be permitted to seek counsel.
If the person will not accept service voluntarily, the party requesting service will be notified and advised to follow
procedures prescribed by the law of the foreign country concerned. (See, for example, The Hague Convention, reprinted
in 28 USCA Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, following Rule 4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Suits against the United States. DA personnel served with foreign civil process will notify the appropriate SJA
or legal adviser, who will return the document to the issuing authority explaining the lack of authority to accept
service for the United States. Service on the United States must be made upon DOJ through established diplomatic channels.

(a) Immediate notice to HQDA. When an SJA or legal adviser learns of litigation in which the United States has an interest,
and it appears that HQDA is not aware of the action, the SJA or legal adviser will telephonically notify the responsible
HQDA office. (See &sect;516.15(c)). Immediate notice is particularly important when litigation involves one of
the following: a lawsuit against an employee in his individual capacity; a motion for a temporary restraining order
or preliminary injunction; a habeas corpus proceeding; a judicial or administrative proceeding involving less
than 60 days to file an answer; and, actions with possible Congressional, Secretarial, or Army Staff interest. For
legal proceedings instituted in foreign tribunals, the SJA or legal adviser will also notify the major overseas commander
concerned and the appropriate U.S. Embassy or Legation. A telephonic report to HQDA should include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Title or style of the proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. A soldier may file a writ of habeas corpus to challenge his continued custody (usually in a post court-martial
situation) or retention in the Army. As is the case with injunctive relief in the preceding paragraph, installation
SJAs and legal advisers must take immediate action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Notification to Litigation Division and U.S. Attorney. The SJA or legal adviser will notify Litigation Division
and the responsible U.S. Attorney's Office immediately upon learning that a petition for writ of habeas corpus has
been filed. All relevant documentary evidence supporting the challenged action should be assembled immediately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Procedures in habeas corpus. Upon the filing of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the court will dismiss the
petition, issue the writ, or order the respondent to show cause why it should not be granted. If a writ or order to show
cause is issued, the SJA or legal adviser should be prepared to assist the responsible Litigation Division or DOJ attorney
in preparing a return and answer. If so directed, the SJA will also prepare a memorandum of points and authorities to
accompany the return and answer. The government's response should cover the following: whether the Army has custody
of petitioner; whether respondent and petitioner are within the judicial district; and, whether appellate or administrative
remedies have been exhausted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Writs or orders issued by state courts. No state court, after being judicially informed that a petitioner is in
custody under the authority of the United States, should interfere with that custody or require that petitioner be
brought before the state court. A deserter, apprehended by any civil officer having authority to apprehend offenders
under the laws of the United States or of any state, district, territory, or possession of the United States, is in custody
by authority of the United States. If a writ of habeas corpus is issued by a state court, the SJA or legal adviser will
seek guidance from Litigation Division.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Foreign court orders. A foreign court should not inquire into the legality of restraint of a person held by U.S.
military authority. If a foreign court issues any process in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus, the SJA or legal adviser
will immediately report the matter to the appropriate U.S. forces commander and to Litigation Division.

Litigation against government contractors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. A contract might require that the government reimburse a contractor (or subcontractor) for adverse
judgments or litigation expenses. Unless a contractor or subcontractor facing a lawsuit requests representation
by DOJ, the Army presumes the contractor will obtain private counsel to defend the case. If the contract so allows,
however, the contractor may request and HQDA may recommend that DOJ represent the contractor if it is in the best interests
of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Actions by SJA or legal adviser. If a contractor or subcontractor faces litigation and the underlying contract
with the government requires reimbursement for adverse judgments or costs of the litigation, the SJA or legal adviser,
through the contracting officer, should determine if the contractor desires representation by DOJ. If so, the contractor
or authorized agent will sign a request for representation. (See Figure D&hyph;3, Appendix G, of this part.) The SJA
or legal adviser will determine whether, in his opinion, representation by DOJ should be granted. He will prepare
a memorandum to support his recommendation, especially concerning any issue regarding the government's obligation
to reimburse the contractor under the contract. The SJA or legal adviser will forward his memorandum, along with the
contractor's request, to Litigation Division.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Actions by Litigation Division. The Chief, Litigation Division, will evaluate the submission and decide if it
is in the Army's best interest that the request be granted. He will prepare a memorandum supporting his decision and
send the packet to DOJ. The Chief's decision constitutes the final DA position on the matter. If DOJ grants the contractor's
request, the Chief, Litigation Division, will ensure that the contractor is notified through the SJA or legal adviser
and the contracting officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Private Counsel. A contractor represented by DOJ may ask that private counsel assist the DOJ attorney in the litigation.
The DOJ attorney will remain in control of the litigation, and the fees for private counsel will not be reimbursable
except under unusual circumstances. The contractor must seek both DOJ and DA approval to employ private counsel when
DOJ representation has been granted. Even if DOJ and DA grant authority to employ private counsel, the contracting
officer will determine whether a contractor will be reimbursed under the contract for private counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Settlement. The contractor, unless the contract specifies otherwise, will ultimately decide whether to compromise
a suit. Reimbursement under the contract is determined by the contracting officer, with the advice of his attorney.

The SJA or legal adviser will prepare a litigation report when directed by HQDA. The report will contain the following
sections: Statement of Facts; Setoff or Counterclaim; Responses to Pleadings; Memorandum of Law; Witness List;
and, Exhibits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Statement of Facts. Include a complete statement of the facts upon which the action and any defense thereto are
based. Where possible, support facts by reference to documents or witness statements. Include details of previous
administrative actions, such as the filing and results of an administrative claim. If the action is predicated on
the Federal Tort Claims Act, include a description of the plaintiff's relationship to the United States, its instrumentalities,
or its contractors. Also include a statement whether an insurance company or other third party has an interest in the
plaintiff's claim by subrogation or otherwise and whether there are additional claims related to the same incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Setoff or Counterclaim. Discuss whether setoff or counterclaim exists. If so, highlight the supportive facts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Responses to Pleadings. Prepare a draft answer or other appropriate response to the pleadings. (See Figure C&hyph;1,
to this part). Discuss whether allegations of fact are well-founded. Refer to evidence that refutes factual allegations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Memorandum of Law. Include a brief statement of the applicable law with citations to legal authority. Discussions
of local law, if applicable, should cover relevant issues such as measure of damages, scope of employment, effect
of contributory negligence, or limitations upon death and survival actions. Do not unduly delay submission of a litigation
report to prepare a comprehensive memorandum of law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Potential witness information. List each person having information relevant to the case and provide an office
address and telephone number. If there is no objection, provide the individual's social security account number,
home address, and telephone number. This is ``core information'' required by Executive Order No. 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform). Finally, summarize the information or potential testimony that each person listed could provide.

(f) Exhibits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Attach a copy of all relevant documents. This is ``core information'' required by Executive Order No. 12778 (Civil
Justice Reform). Unless otherwise directed by HQDA, each exhibit should be tabbed and internally paginated. References
to exhibits in the litigation report should be to page numbers of particular exhibits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Copies of relevant reports of claims officers, investigating officers, boards or similar data should be attached,
although such reports will not obviate the requirement for preparation of a complete litigation report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Prepare an index of tabs and exhibits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where a relevant document has been released pursuant to a FOIA request, provide a copy of the response, or otherwise
identify the requestor and the records released. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Distribution and number of copies. Unless HQDA directs otherwise, SJAs or legal advisers will mail (first class)
an original and one copy of the litigation report to the responsible HQDA office (See &sect;516.15 of this part) and
one copy to the U.S. Attorney's Office handling the case. If possible, record the litigation report onto a magnetic
diskette, using either WordPerfect, Enable, or ACSII, and send it to Litigation Division.

(a) General. The DA Form 4 (See Figure C&hyph;2, Appendix G, of this part) is used to authenticate Army records or documents.
Documents attached to a properly prepared and sealed DA Form 4 are self-authenticating. (See Fed. R. Evid. 902). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Preparation at the installation level. A DA Form 4 need not be prepared until the trial attorney presenting the
government's case identifies documents maintained at the installation level which he will need at trial. Once documents
are identified, the custodian of the documents will execute his portion of the DA Form 4. (See Figure C&hyph;2, Appendix
G, of this part). The custodian certifies that the documents attached to the DA Form 4 are true copies of official documents.
Documents attached to each form should be generally identified; each document need not be mentioned specifically.
Only the upper portion of the form should be executed at the local level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Actions at HQDA. Upon receipt of the DA Form 4 with documents attached thereto, HQDA will affix a ribbon and seal
and deliver it to the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army. That office will place the
official Army seal on the packet.

(a) General. Under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. l746, whenever any matter is required or permitted to be established
or proven by a sworn statement, oath or affidavit, such matter may also be established or proven by an unsworn written
declaration under penalty of perjury. Because such declaration does not require a notary or other official to administer
oaths, individuals preparing statements for use in litigation should consider using this format. (See Figure C&hyph;3,

This subpart guidance when DA personnel, as a result of the performance of their official duties, are either sued in
their personal capacity, or are charged in a criminal proceeding. Examples of civil actions alleging individual
liability include the following: a medical malpractice lawsuit against health care providers; suits resulting
from motor vehicle accidents; constitutional torts; or, common law torts such as assault, libel, or intentional
infliction of emotional distress. Likewise, state or Federal criminal charges can arise from the performance of
official duties, including environmental crimes or motor vehicle accidents.

in their individual capacity as a result of performance of their official duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) DOJ policy on representation. If in the best interest of the United States, upon request of the individual concerned,
and upon certification by his agency that he was acting within the scope of his employment, DOJ may represent present
and former DA personnel sued individually as a result of actions taken within the scope of their employment. Representation
can be declined for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to the following: the employee was not acting within
the scope of his office; there is a conflict of interest; or, actions were not taken in a good faith effort to conform
to law.

Procedures for obtaining certification and DOJ representation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) SJA or legal adviser procedures. When an SJA or legal adviser learns of a criminal charge or of a lawsuit alleging
individual liability against DA personnel as a result of performance of official duties, he will take the following
actions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) Immediately notify Litigation Division and the appropriate U.S. Attorney and FAX or express deliver copies of
process and pleadings to each office. Where time for response is limited, request that the U.S. Attorney either petition
the court for an extension of time, or provide temporary counsel and representation pending formal approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Investigate whether the employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment. Obtain, if possible,
statements from the defendant, supervisors, and witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Advise the individual defendant of the rights and conditions set out in 28 CFR 50.15, which include the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) His right to request representation by a DOJ attorney and, in appropriate cases, certification that he was acting
within the scope of employment. (See 28 U.S.C. 2679; 28 CFR 50.15). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The right to request private counsel at government expense, subject to the availability of funds. (See 28 CFR
50.16). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) That the United States is not obligated to pay or indemnify defendant for any judgment rendered against him in
his individual capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the defendant desires certification or DOJ representation, have him sign a request. (See Figure D&hyph;1,
Appendix G, of this part). Obtain a signed scope of employment statement from the defendant's supervisor. (Figure
D&hyph;2, Appendix G, of this part). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Prepare a report with, at a minimum, the following information: facts surrounding the incident for which defendant
is being sued and those relating to scope of employment; the SJA's or legal adviser's conclusions concerning scope
of employment; and, a recommendation whether certification by the Attorney General or representation by a DOJ attorney
should be granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) In cases involving National Guard personnel, address also the following: whether defendant was acting in a state
(Title 32 U.S.C.) or Federal (Title 10 U.S.C.) capacity during relevant periods (include orders); if defendant was
acting under state authority, is it nevertheless in the interest of the United States to represent the individual;
any impact on policies or practices of DA, the National Guard Bureau, or DOD; whether the relief requested can be granted
only by a Federal officer or agency; and, whether Federal law or regulation required actions by state officials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Send the report, request for representation, and scope of employment statements to Chief, Litigation Division.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Chief, Litigation Division, procedures. The Chief, Litigation Division, will review the report and evidence
regarding representation and scope of employment and will determine whether certification and representation
are appropriate. He will send his recommendation to the appropriate U.S. Attorney or office within DOJ. The Chief,
Litigation Division, will notify the defendant of DOJ's decision.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. DA personnel, sued in their individual capacity or facing criminal charges as a result of performance
of official duties, have no right to employ a private sector counsel at government expense or to expect reimbursement
for the same. For proceedings in the United States, a request for employment of counsel at government expense may be
approved by DOJ, contingent among other things upon availability of funds and a determination that employment of
private counsel at government expense is in the best interests of the United States. (See 28 CFR 50.16). Special rules
apply in overseas areas. (See paragraph (e) of this section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Individual request procedures. The individual will prepare a request that private counsel be employed for him
at government expense. The request must also contain the following statement: ``I understand that the United States
is not required to employ private counsel on my behalf, and that I may be responsible for expenses incurred prior to
proper authorization by the Department of the Army or the Department of Justice.''

who will make a recommendation and forward the packet to the local SJA or legal adviser. The SJA or legal adviser will
prepare his own recommendation and forward the matter to Litigation Division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Chief, Litigation Division, procedures. If the Chief, Litigation Division, determines that the request for
private counsel is meritorious, he will prepare an appropriate recommendation and forward the packet to Civil Division,
DOJ, for final approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Special actions in foreign countries. Employment of private counsel in foreign proceedings is governed by AR
27&hyph;50 (Status of Forces Policies, Procedures, and Information). Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1037, soldiers,
as well as employees or those accompanying the armed forces overseas, may be granted individual counsel in civil and
criminal proceedings, under the criteria of AR 27&hyph;50.

Requests for indemnification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Policy. An individual liable for a judgment rendered against him in his individual capacity has no right to reimbursement
from DA. DA will consider, however, a request for indemnification from DA personnel where conduct within the scope
of official duties has resulted in personal liability and indemnification is in the best interests of the United States.
Indemnification is strictly contingent upon an appropriation to pay the judgment, as well as availability of such
funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Individual request procedures. An individual against whom an adverse judgment has been rendered may request
indemnification. The request must include, at a minimum, the following: how the employee was acting within the scope
of his employment; whether the requestor has insurance or any other source of indemnification; and, how reimbursement
is in the best interests of the United States. The request must also contain the following statements: ``I understand
that acceptance of this request for indemnification for processing by DA does not constitute an acceptance of any
obligation to make such a payment. I also understand that payment is contingent on availability of funds and that it
will only be made if such is determined to be in the best interests of the United States.'' The individual should attach
a copy of relevant documents, for example, court's opinion, judgment, and other allied papers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Supervisory and SJA procedures. The request for indemnification will be submitted through supervisory channels
to the local SJA or legal adviser. Each supervisor will make a recommendation on the propriety of reimbursement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Chief, Litigation Division, procedures. Requests for indemnification will be forwarded to Chief, Litigation
Division. The Chief, Litigation Division, will examine the submission and, after consultation with DOJ or other
agencies, forward the packet with his recommendation to the Army General Counsel. The General Counsel will obtain
a final decision by the Secretary of the Army or his designee on the matter. There is no administrative appeal of the
Secretary's (or his designee's) decision.

General. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 2651). The act provides for the recovery of medical care expenses
incurred because of a tortfeasor's actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711). The act provides for the collection of claims for money or property
arising from the activities of Federal agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Third-party Collection Program (10 U.S.C. 1095). The statute provides for collection of reasonable costs of
health-care services, provided in facilities of the uniformed services to covered beneficiaries, from private
insurers or third-party payers. In accordance with DOD Instruction 6010.15, ``Third Party Collection (TPC) Program,''
7 March 1991, the authority to settle or waive a DOD claim under the act is delegated to TJAG or to his designee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Executive Order No. 12778, (56 FR 55195; 3 CFR, 1991 Comp. p. 359), Civil Justice Reform. This order establishes
several requirements on Federal agencies involved in litigation or contemplating filing an action on behalf of the
United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) AR 27&hyph;20, Claims. Chapter l4 (Affirmative Claims) contains comprehensive guidance for Recovery Judge
Advocates (RJAs) in the administrative determination, assertion, collection, settlement, and waiver of claims
in favor of the U.S. for property damage and for medical care claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Duties and Procedures. In accordance with Chapter 14, AR 27&hyph;20, Commander, USARCS, has supervisory responsibility
over the administrative processing of property and medical care claims by RJAs. The Commander, U.S. Army Health Services
Command (HSC), has supervisory responsibility over the Third Party Collection Program (TPCP). The HSC TPCP Implementation
Plan effects DOD Instruction 6010.15 and establishes procedures for processing TPC claims. Litigation Division,
in conjunction with DOJ and U.S. Attorneys, is responsible for pursuing, through litigation, claims not resolved
administratively. DOJ is ultimately responsible for initiating litigation for the United States. (28 U.S.C. 515).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Assertion of claims on behalf of the United States by private attorneys. The Army incurs potentially recoverable
expenses when it provides medical care to soldiers or dependents injured by tortfeasors (for example, a soldier is
hospitalized after an automobile accident). When injured personnel employ a private attorney to sue the tortfeasor,
it may be in the Government's best interests to enter into an agreement with the private attorney to include the Army's
medical care claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Statute of limitations. There is a three year statute of limitations for actions in favor of the U.S. for money damages
founded upon tort. (28 U.S.C. 2415(b)). Limitations periods can vary, however, depending upon the theory of liability
and the jurisdiction involved. RJAs must be alert to the applicable period of limitations. A case referred for litigation
should arrive at Litigation Division at least 6 months before the expiration of the limitations period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Reporting of recoveries. Amounts recovered through litigation will be reported to USARCS by Tort Branch, Litigation
Division, or, where referred directly to a U.S. Attorney or the Nationwide Central Intake Facility (NCIF), by the
responsible RJA.

litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Criteria for referral. The RJA will forward the claims file and a litigation report (See &sect;516.35 of this part)
through USARCS to Litigation Division when the claim has not been resolved administratively and any of the following
conditions exist: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claim exceeds $5,000; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It involves collection from the injured party or his attorney; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The claim raises an important question of policy; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) There is potential for a significant precedent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Alternative methods. When none of the conditions cited in the preceding subparagraph are present, the RJA may
refer the claim directly to the U.S. Attorney for the district in which the prospective defendant resides. Similar
property claims may be referred through USARCS to DOJ's Nationwide Central Intake Facility (NCIF) rather than directly
to the U.S. Attorney. Notice of all such referrals shall be provided through USARCS to Tort Branch, Litigation Division.
The RJA should be ready to provide support to the U.S. Attorney if requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Closing Files. A file referred directly to the U.S. Attorney will be closed if the U.S. Attorney determines further
action is unwarranted. If the RJA disagrees, the file should be forwarded with the RJA's recommendation through USARCS
to Litigation Division.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. In preparing a referral for litigation the RJA will ensure the file contains at least the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A litigation report (See &sect;516.23 of this part) that demonstrates a factual basis for the claim and a theory
of recovery under applicable state law. (See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Copies of all medical records and bills reflecting the reasonable value of the medical care furnished to the injured
party, including DA Form 2631&hyph;R (Medical Care-Third Party Liability Notification), and DA Form 3154 (MSA Invoice
and Receipt). These documents should be authenticated as necessary on a DA Form 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Copies of all documents necessary to establish the value of lost or damaged property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Transmittal letter. The letter of transmittal referring the claim for litigation should briefly summarize the
facts giving rise to the claim and the collection actions previously taken by the Army and the injured party.

(a) General. The majority of cases filed on behalf of the United States will fall under this subpart E. All other civil
cases which cannot be resolved administratively or by direct referral to DOJ will be forwarded through channels to
Litigation Division with a litigation report. (See &sect;516.23 of this part). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Government contractors. It may be in the Government's best interest to authorize a Government contractor, whose
contract provides for the reimbursement of necessary legal expenses, to employ private counsel to initiate legal
proceedings against a third party. To obtain authorization to employ private counsel in such instances the contractor
should follow the procedures in &sect;516.21(c) of this part.

(a) General. U.S. Attorneys are authorized to accept a Federal agency's request for the following purposes: to initiate
an action to recover possession of real property from tenants, trespassers, and others; to enjoin trespasses on Federal
property; and, to collect delinquent rentals or damages for use and occupancy of real property for amounts less than
$200,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Procedures. When eviction or an action to collect delinquent rent is necessary, the SJA or legal adviser will notify
General Litigation Branch, Litigation Division, of the situation. If approved by Litigation Division, the SJA or
legal adviser may ask the U.S. Attorney to file suit. A copy of the complaint will be sent to Litigation Division. DOJ
can take action to evict the occupants for violation of the terms of occupancy and collect delinquent rent or other
charges. Once the matter has been referred to the U.S. Attorney, payments for rent should be sent to the U.S. Attorney.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Introduction. This subpart implements DOD Directive 5405.2 (See Appendix C to this part and 32 CFR part 97). It
governs the release of official information and the appearance of present and former DA personnel as witnesses in
response to requests for interviews, notices of depositions, subpoenas, and other requests or orders related to
judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. Requests for records, if not in the nature of legal process, should be processed
under AR 25&hyph;55 (The Department of the Army Freedom of Information Act Program) or AR 340&hyph;21 (The Army Privacy
Program). This subpart pertains to any request for witnesses, documents, or information for all types of litigation,
including requests by private litigants, requests by State or U.S. attorneys, requests by foreign officials or tribunals,
subpoenas for records or testimony, notices of depositions, interview requests, civil cases, criminal proceedings,
private litigation, or litigation in which the United States has an interest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General Rule. Except as authorized by this subpart, present or former DA personnel will not disclose official
information (See Appendix F_Glossary) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Exception. Present or former DA personnel may disclose official information if they obtain the written approval
of the appropriate SJA, legal adviser, or Litigation Division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Referral to deciding official. If present or former DA personnel receive a subpoena, court order, request for
attendance at a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, or request for an interview related to actual or potential
litigation, and it appears the subpoena, order, or request seeks disclosures described in a above, the individual
should immediately advise the appropriate SJA or legal adviser. If the SJA or legal adviser cannot informally satisfy
the subpoena, order, or request in accordance with &sect;&sect;516.43 through 516.50 of this subpart, he should
consult with Litigation Division.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) Requesters' responsibilities. Individuals seeking official information must submit, at least 14 days before
the desired date of production, a specific written request setting forth the nature and relevance of the official
information sought. (Requesters can be referred to this Subpart G). Subject to &sect;516.47(a), present and former
DA personnel may only produce, disclose, release, comment upon, or testify concerning those matters specified in
writing and properly approved by the SJA, legal adviser, or Litigation Division. (See United States ex. rel. Touhy
v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Litigation in which the United States has an interest. If a subpoena, order, or request relates to litigation in
which the United States has an interest and for which litigation responsibility has not been delegated, the SJA or
legal adviser will coordinate with Litigation Division under &sect;516.42. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Motions to stay or quash subpoenas. A subpoena should never be ignored, and an SJA or legal adviser should seek assistance
from Litigation Division or the U.S. Attorney's office whenever necessary. If a response to a subpoena or order is
required before a release determination can be made or before Litigation Division or the U.S. Attorney can be contacted,
the SJA or legal adviser will do the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Furnish the court or tribunal a copy of this regulation (32 CFR part 516, Subpart G) and applicable case law (See
United States ex. rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951)); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Inform the court or tribunal that the requesting individual has not complied with this Chapter, as set out in 32
CFR 97 &amp; 516, or that the subpoena or order is being reviewed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Seek to stay the subpoena or order pending the requestor's compliance with this chapter or final determination
by Litigation Division; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the court or other tribunal declines to quash or stay the subpoena or order, inform Litigation Division immediately
so a decision can be made whether to challenge the subpoena or order. If Litigation Division decides not to challenge
the subpoena or order, the affected personnel will comply with the subpoena or order. If Litigation Division decides
to challenge the subpoena or order, it will direct the affected personnel to respectfully decline to comply with the
subpoena or order. (See United States ex. rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Classified or sensitive information. Only Litigation Division may authorize the release of official information
or appearance of DA personnel as witnesses in litigation involving terrorism, espionage, nuclear weapons, or intelligence
sources and methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Requests for Inspector General records or testimony. IG records, and information obtained through performance
of IG duties, are official information under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Army. (See AR 20&hyph;l,
Chapter 3.) IG records frequently contain sensitive official information that may be classified or obtained under
guarantees of confidentiality. When justification exists, DA attorneys will seek court protection from disclosure
of IG records and information. No DA personnel will release IG records or disclose information obtained through performance
of IG duties without the approval of The Secretary of the Army, The Inspector General, TIG Legal Advisor, or Chief,
Litigation Division. When IG personnel receive a subpoena, court order, request for attendance at a judicial or quasi-judicial
proceeding, or a request for an interview which the IG reasonably believes is related to actual or potential litigation
concerning IG records or related information, they should immediately notify the Inspector General Legal Adviser
or the Chief, Litigation Division. IG personnel will follow the guidance of this subpart concerning actions to be
taken regarding disclosure and testimony.

(a) Preservation of originals. To preserve the integrity of DA records, DA personnel will submit properly authenticated
copies rather than originals of documents or records for use in legal proceedings, unless directed otherwise by Litigation
Division. (See 28 U.S.C. 1733.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Authentication of copies. Copies of DA records approved for release can be authenticated for introduction in
evidence by use of DA Form 4. (See &sect;516.25 for instructions.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Records maintained in U.S. Army Engineer Districts and Divisions will be forwarded to HQDA(CECC&hyph;K), WASH
DC 20314&hyph;1000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All other records will be forwarded to the appropriate office at HQDA (See &sect;516.42). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Fees and charges. AR 37&hyph;60 prescribes the schedule of fees and charges for searching, copying, and certifying
Army records for release in response to litigation-related requests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Release of records of other agencies. Normally an individual requesting records originating in agencies outside
DA (that is, FBI reports, local police reports, civilian hospital records) that are also included in Army records
should be advised to direct his inquiry to the originating agency.

Determination of release authorization.

(a) Policy. DA policy is to make official information reasonably available for use in Federal and state courts and
by other governmental bodies unless the information is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from public
disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Releasability factors. In deciding whether to authorize release of official information, the deciding official
should consider the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Has the requester complied with DA policy governing the release of official documents in &sect;516.41(d) of this
part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is the request unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable court rules? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is the disclosure appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the matter in which the request arose? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Would the disclosure violate a statute, executive order, regulation, or directive? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Is the disclosure appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Would the disclosure reveal information properly classified pursuant to the DOD Information Security Program
under AR 380&hyph;5, unclassified technical data withheld from public release pursuant to 32 CFR &sect;250, or other
matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Would disclosure interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, reveal
the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, disclose trade secrets or confidential commercial
or financial information, or, otherwise be inappropriate under the circumstances? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Would the disclosure violate any person's expectation of confidentiality or privacy?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the deciding official, after considering the factors set forth in &sect;536.44, determines that all or part of
requested official records are releasable, copies of the records should be furnished to the requester.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General. If the deciding official, after considering the factors in &sect;516.44, determines that all or part
of requested official records should not be released, he will promptly communicate directly with the attorney or
individual who caused the issuance of the subpoena, order, or request and seek to resolve the matter informally. If
the subpoena or order is invalid, he should explain the basis of the invalidity. The deciding official should also
explain why the records requested are privileged from release. The deciding official should attempt to obtain the
agreement of the requester to withdraw the subpoena, order, or request or to modify the subpoena, order, or request
so that it pertains only to records which may be released. (See Figure G&hyph;1, Appendix G, of this part.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) A subpoena duces tecum or other legal process signed by an attorney or clerk of court for records protected by the
Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, does not justify the release of the protected records. The deciding official should explain
to the requester that the Privacy Act precludes disclosure of records in a system of records without the written consent
of the subject of the records or ``pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.'' (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(11)).
An ``order of the court'' for the purpose of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(11) is an order or writ requiring the production
of the records, signed by a judge or magistrate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Unclassified records otherwise privileged from release under 5 U.S.C. 552a may be released to the court under
either of the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The subpoena is accompanied by an order signed by a judge or magistrate, or such order is separately served, that
orders the person to whom the records pertain to release the specific records, or that orders copies of the records
be delivered to the clerk of court, and indicates that the court has determined the materiality of the records and the
nonavailability of a claim of privilege. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The clerk of the court is empowered by local statute or practice to receive the records under seal subject to request
that they be withheld from the parties until the court determines whether the records are material to the issues and
until any question of privilege is resolved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Subpoenas for alcohol abuse or drug abuse treatment records must be processed under 42 U.S.C. 290dd-3 and 290ee-3,
and Public Health Service regulations published at 42 CFR 2.1_2.67. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Upon request, SJAs and legal advisers may furnish to the attorney for the injured party or the tortfeasor's attorney
or insurance company a copy of the narrative summary of medical care that relates to a claim under Subpart E of this part.
If additional medical records are requested, only those that directly pertain to the pending action will be furnished.
If furnishing copies of medical records would prejudice the cause of action, the matter will be reported to Litigation
Division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Referral to Litigation Division. If the SJA or legal adviser is not able to resolve a request for Army records informally,
he should contact Litigation Division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Litigation Division may respond to subpoenas or orders for records privileged from release by informing the local
U.S. Attorney about the subpoena and requesting that office file a motion to quash the subpoena or a motion for a protective
order. The records privileged from release should be retained by the custodian pending the court's ruling upon the
government's motion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When a motion to quash or for a protective order is not filed, or the motion is unsuccessful, and the appropriate
DA official has determined that no further efforts will be made to protect the records, copies of the records (authenticated
if necessary) will be submitted to the court (or to the clerk of court) in response to the subpoena or order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Classified and privileged materials. Requests from DOJ, U.S. Attorneys, or attorneys for other governmental
entities for records which are classified or otherwise privileged from release will be referred to Litigation Division.

(a) Policy. The involvement of present or former DA personnel in private litigation is solely a personal matter between
the witness and the requesting party, unless one or more of the following conditions apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The testimony involves official information. (See Appendix F_Glossary to this part). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The witness is to testify as an expert. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The absence of the witness from duty will seriously interfere with the accomplishment of a military mission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Former DA personnel. Former DA personnel may freely respond to requests for interviews and subpoenas except in
instances involving official information (paragraph (a)(1) of this section) or concerning expert testimony prohibited
by &sect;516.49. In those instances, the subject of the request or subpoena should take the action specified in &sect;&sect;516.41(c)
and 516.42.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Present DA personnel. Present DA personnel will refer all requests for interviews and subpoenas for testimony
in private litigation through their supervisor to the appropriate SJA or legal adviser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Discretion to testify. Any individual not wishing to grant an interview or to testify concerning private litigation
may seek the advice of an Army attorney concerning the consequences, if any, of refusal. Any individual not authorized
to consult with Army counsel should consult with private counsel, at no expense to the government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In instances involving &sect;516.47(a)(1), the matter will be referred to the SJA or legal adviser serving the
organization of the individual whose testimony is requested, or to HQDA pursuant to &sect;516.47(a). The deciding
official will determine whether to release the information sought under the principles established in &sect;516.44.
If funding by the United States is requested, see &sect;516.55(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the deciding official determines that the information may be released, the individual will be permitted to
be interviewed, deposed, or to appear as a witness in court provided such interview or appearance is consistent with
the requirements of &sect;&sect;516.49 and 516.50. (See, for example, Figure G&hyph;2, Appendix G, to this part).
A JA or DA civilian attorney should be present during any interview or testimony to act as legal representative of the
Army. If a question seeks information not previously authorized for release, the legal representative will advise
the witness not to answer. If necessary to avoid release of the information, the legal representative will advise
the witness to terminate the interview or deposition, or in the case of testimony in court, advise the judge that DOD
directives and Army regulations preclude the witness from answering without HQDA approval. Every effort should
be made, however, to substitute releasable information and to continue the interview or testimony.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) General rule. Present DA personnel will not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony
either in private litigation or in litigation in which the United States has an interest for a party other than the United
States. Former DA personnel will not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony concerning
official information, subjects, or activities either in private litigation or in litigation in which the United
States has an interest for a party other than the United States. (See Figure G&hyph;3, Appendix G of this part). An SJA
or legal adviser is authorized to deny a request for expert testimony, which decision may be appealed to Litigation
Division.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Exception to the general prohibition. If a requester can show exceptional need or unique circumstances, and the
anticipated testimony will not be adverse to the interests of the United States, Litigation Division may grant special
written authorization for present or former DA personnel to testify as expert or opinion witnesses at no expense to
the United States. In no event may present or former DA personnel furnish expert or opinion testimony in a case in which
the United States has an interest for a party whose interests are adverse to the interests of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Exception for AMEDD personnel. Members of the Army medical department or other qualified specialists may testify
in private litigation with the following limitations (See Figure G&hyph;4, Appendix G, of this part):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The litigation involves patients they have treated, investigations they have made, laboratory tests they have
conducted, or other actions taken in the regular course of their duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) They limit their testimony to factual matters such as the following: their observations of the patient or other
operative facts; the treatment prescribed or corrective action taken; course of recovery or steps required for repair
of damage suffered; and, contemplated future treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Their testimony may not extend to expert or opinion testimony, to hypothetical questions, or to a prognosis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Court-ordered expert or opinion testimony. If a court or other appropriate authority orders expert or opinion
testimony, the witness will immediately notify Litigation Division. If Litigation Division determines it will
not challenge the subpoena or order, the witness will comply with the subpoena or order. If directed by Litigation
Division, however, the witness will respectfully decline to comply with the subpoena or order. (See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Reassignment of witnesses. When requested by the U.S. Attorney, the SJA or legal adviser will ensure that no witnesses
are reassigned from the judicial district without advising the DOJ attorney. If a witness is vital to the government's
case and trial is imminent, the SJA or legal adviser should make informal arrangements to retain the witness in the
command until trial. If this is not feasible, or if a satisfactory arrangement cannot be reached with the DOJ attorney,
the SJA or legal adviser should notify Litigation Division.

Witnesses for the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Status of witness. A military member authorized to appear as a witness for the United States, including those authorized
to appear under &sect;516.55(d), will be placed on temporary duty. If USAR or NG personnel are requested as witnesses
for the United States, and if their testimony arises from their active duty service, they should be placed on active
duty to testify. The status of a civilian employee will be determined under Federal Personnel Manual 630, subchapter
10. DA personnel who appear as necessary witnesses for a party asserting the government's claim for medical care expenses
are witnesses for the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Travel arrangements. Travel arrangements for witnesses for the United States normally are made by DOJ through
Litigation Division for other than local travel. Litigation Division will issue instructions for this travel, including
fund citation, to the appropriate commander. A U.S. Attorney, or an attorney asserting the government's medical
care claim under Subpart E, may make arrangements for local travel through the SJA or legal adviser for attendance
of a witness who is stationed at an installation within the same judicial district, or not more than 100 miles from the
place where testifying. Other requests, including those under &sect;516.55(d), will be referred to Litigation
Division. The instructions from Litigation Division, or the request from the U.S. Attorney or the attorney asserting
the government's claim, will serve as a basis for the issuance of appropriate travel orders by the local commander.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Travel and per diem expenses. The witness' commander or supervisor should ensure the witness has sufficient funds
to defray expenses. The SJA or legal adviser will provide assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Where local travel is performed at the request of a U.S. Attorney and the testimony does not involve information
acquired in the performance of duties, transportation arrangements and any per diem expenses are the responsibility
of the U.S. Attorney.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An attorney asserting the government's medical care or property claim may be required to advance local travel
expense money to the witness requested and to include these in recoverable costs where the government's claim is not
large enough to justify expenditures of government travel funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Other local travel and per diem expense for cases involving Army activities or claims are proper expenses of the
command issuing the orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Litigation Division will furnish travel expense and per diem funds for other than local travel and will receive
reimbursement from DOJ or other government agencies as appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Status of witness. If authorized to appear as a witness for a state or private litigant, and the testimony to be given
relates to information obtained in the performance of official duties, a military member will attend in a permissive
TDY status. If authorized to appear as a witness, but the testimony does not relate to information obtained in the performance
of official duties, a military member may be granted a pass or permissive TDY under AR 630&hyph;5, or be required to
take ordinary leave. The status of a civilian employee will be determined under 5 CFR Chapter I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Travel arrangements. The requesting party or state agency will make all travel arrangements for attendance of
DA personnel authorized to appear as witnesses for a state or private litigant. The local commander may issue appropriate
orders when necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Travel expenses. The United States may not pay travel, meals, and lodging expenses of the witness, other than normal
allowances for subsistence pursuant to the DOD Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual. These expenses
are solely a matter between the witness and the party seeking his appearance. Witnesses ordinarily should be advised
to require advance payment of such expenses. Military personnel authorized to appear in a pass or permissive TDY status
are not entitled to receive witness attendance fees, but may accept travel, meals, and lodging expense money from
the requesting litigant. All witness fees tendered the military member, to the extent they exceed such actual expenses
of the member, will be remitted to the Treasurer of the United States. A civilian employee authorized to appear in his
or her official capacity will accept the authorized witness fees, in addition to the allowance for travel and subsistence,
and make disposition of the witness fees as instructed by his or her personnel office.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Referral to the SJA. Requests or subpoenas from a foreign government or tribunal for present DA personnel stationed
or employed within that country to be interviewed or to appear as witnesses will be forwarded to the SJA of the command
exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the unit to which the individual is assigned, attached, or employed.
The SJA will determine the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether a consideration listed in &sect;516.47(a)(1) through (a)(3) applies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether the information requested is releasable under the principles established in &sect;516.43 through &sect;516.46.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether the approval of the American Embassy should be obtained because the person is attached to the Embassy staff
or a question of diplomatic immunity may be involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) United States has an interest in the litigation. If the SJA determines that the United States has an interest in
the litigation, the commander may authorize the interview or order the individual's attendance in a temporary duty
status. The United States will be deemed to have an interest in the litigation if it is bound by treaty or other international
agreement to ensure the attendance of such personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) United States has no interest in the litigation. If the SJA determines that the United States does not have an interest
in the litigation, the commander may authorize the interview or the appearance of the witness under the principles
established in &sect;516.47 through &sect;516.50.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Witnesses located outside the requester's country. If the requested witness is stationed in a country other than
the requester's, the matter will be referred to Litigation Division.

remedies in significant cases of fraud or corruption relating to Army procurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The key elements of the Army's procurement fraud program follow: centralized policy making and program direction;
fraud remedies coordination; decentralized responsibility for operational matters, such as reporting and remedial
action; continuous case monitorship by PFD from the initial report until final disposition; and, command-wide fraud
awareness training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Remedies for PFI will be pursued in a timely manner and properly coordinated with other agencies. Every effort
will be made to support criminal investigation and prosecution of fraudulent activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) A specific remedies plan will be formulated for each significant case of fraud or corruption involving procurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Coordination on the status and disposition of cases will be maintained between PFD, OTJAG, PFI Coordinators at
MACOMs, and Procurement Fraud Advisers at subordinate commands. Coordination of procurement and personnel actions
will be accomplished with investigative agencies as required by those agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Training which relates to fraud and corruption in the procurement process is a significant element of this program.

Reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Typical fraud indicators during the procurement cycle are listed in Figure D&hyph;1, Appendix G, to this part.
The mere presence of one or more of these indicators does not, by itself, require reporting under paragraph b of this
section. Reports should be submitted if there is a reasonable suspicion of procurement fraud or irregularity or the
procuring agency refers the matter for investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) ``Procurement Flash Reports'' will be transmitted by FAX directly to PFD whenever a PFI Coordinator or PFA receives
notice of a PFI involving the Army. To facilitate filing, a separate sheet should be used for each case reported. These
reports will provide a succinct summary of the following available information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Name and address of contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Known subsidiaries of parent firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Any of the above categories that cannot be completed will be annotated as ``unknown at present.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When a report is required by DFARS or is requested by PFD, the provisions of DFARS 209.406&hyph;3 (48 CFR 209.406&hyph;3)
will be followed. That paragraph provides the basic content and format for PFI reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All personnel will cooperate to ensure that investigations and prosecutions of procurement fraud are completed
in a timely and thorough manner. Requests for assistance from federal prosecutors should be processed through the
local PFA whenever possible. Requests for federal investigators will be processed through the supporting USACIDC
and the PFA will be notified. When the conduct of criminal investigations and prosecutions conflict with the progress
of procurements, reasonable deference will be given to criminal investigators and prosecutors whenever possible.
Any serious conflict that cannot be resolved at a local level will be immediately reported to the PFI Coordinator or
PFD for action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) PFI Coordinators and PFAs may request access to information obtained during criminal investigations that is
not protected by Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) and use this information to assist them in taking appropriate administrative,
contractual, and civil remedies. Requests for this information should be made directly to the appropriate federal
investigative agency. The investigative organization may withhold requested information if release would compromise
an investigation. Difficulties in obtaining information which cannot be resolved locally will be referred to PFD
for appropriate action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) USACIDC will notify, in writing, local PFAs as well as PFD within 30 days, of initiation of a significant investigation
of fraud or corruption related to Army procurement activities. Such notification will include the following:

Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (PFCRA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) PFCRA was enacted on 21 October 1986 (Public Law 99&hyph;509) and implemented by DOD on 30 August 1988 (DOD Directive
5505.5). (See Appendix E to this part.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) PFCRA expands the capability of the government to deter and recover losses from false, fictitious or fraudulent
claims and statements. It is also applicable to program fraud and provides an administrative remedy in addition to
those otherwise available to the Army in procurement fraud or pay and entitlements fraud cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) As part of the Army implementation, the Secretary of the Army's duties and responsibilities under PFCRA as Authority
Head are delegated to the Army General Counsel. The Chief, Intellectual Property Law Division, is the Army's Reviewing
Official within the meaning of PFCRA. Army implementation also requires DA to follow the policies and procedures
prescribed in enclosure 2 of DOD Directive 5505.5. (See Appendix E to this part.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The DOD Inspector General (IG) is the Investigating Official within DOD. The duties of this position will be performed
by the Assistant IG For Investigations. This individual is vested with the authority to investigate all allegations
of liability under PFCRA. That authority includes the power to task subordinate investigative agencies to review
and report on allegations that are subject to PFCRA. If the Investigative Official concludes that an action under
PFCRA is warranted in an Army case, the official will submit a report containing the findings and conclusions of such
investigation through PFD to the Army Reviewing Official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Pursuant to DOD IG guidance, USACIDC will forward appropriate cases that appear to qualify for resolution under
PFCRA to the Investigating Official in a timely manner. Additionally, USACIDC will forward current information
regarding the status of remedies pending or concluded. USACIDC may obtain remedies information by coordinating
with PFD and the cognizant command.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In pay and entitlement or transportation operation fraud cases, USACIDC will coordinate with the Office of the
Secretary of the Army, Financial Management, Review and Oversight Directorate (SAFM&hyph;RO), to determine the
status of any pending or proposed action under the Debt Collection Act. This information, in addition to information
obtained under &sect;517.68(e), will be forwarded with appropriate cases to the Investigating Official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) In those cases where the Investigating Official has submitted a report to the Army Reviewing Official for action
under PFCRA, PFD will, at the direction of the Reviewing Official, prepare all legal memoranda as necessary to transmit
the Reviewing Official's intention to issue a complaint. As part of this responsibility PFD will do the following:
coordinate with the affected command or agency to ensure that all appropriate remedies have been considered; evaluate
the overall potential benefits to the Army; and, ensure that action under PFCRA is not duplicative of other remedies
already taken. In order to fully supplement the Reviewing Official's file, PFD may request a litigation report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) PFD will coordinate all cases involving transportation operations emanating from Military Traffic Management
Command (MTMC) activity, under the military transportation exception to the FAR, and all cases involving pay and
entitlements fraud with SAFM&hyph;RO, for comments and recommendations. These matters will be forwarded with the
case file to the Reviewing Official.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the Attorney General approves the issuance of a complaint, PFD, at the direction of the Army Reviewing Official,
shall prepare the complaint and all necessary memoranda as required. PFD shall also designate attorneys to represent
the Authority in hearings under PFCRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Labor Counselor will arrange for individual counsel for consultation from local assets. If local assets are
not sufficient, assistance may be requested from other DOD activities in the area or from HQDA, DAJA&hyph;LE. DA attorneys
tasked to consult with one or more witnesses individually will not be tasked to represent the DA activity concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Labor Counselor, as the legal representative of the activity, is precluded from assisting or representing
individual witnesses during OSC interviews.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) ``Accused'' or ``suspected'' DA personnel and counsel for representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the OSC identifies a DA civilian employee or a military member as an ``accused'' or ``suspected'' individual,
or if the Labor Counselor concludes that an individual is a ``suspect,'' the Labor Counselor will inform the individual.
The Labor Counselor also will advise the individual of the availability of counsel for representation upon approval
by DA General Counsel. (See Glossary, Counsel for Representation).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the ``suspected'' individual desires legal representation by DA, the individual must request counsel by submitting
a written request through DAJA&hyph;LE to DA General Counsel. (See Figure I&hyph;1, Appendix G, to this part).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) During the investigation but prior to DA General Counsel approval of the request for counsel, an ``accused'' or
``suspected'' individual will be provided the assistance of counsel for consultation in the same manner as any other
OSC requested witness. ``Accused'' or ``suspected'' individuals who do not request counsel for representation
will be provided counsel for consultation in the same manner as any other OSC requested witness.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) If the DA General Counsel approves the request for counsel, the Chief, DAJA-LE, will appoint a DA attorney to represent
the individual. This appointment may be made telephonically but will be confirmed in writing. The Chief, DAJA-LE,
will make appropriate coordination with MACOM SJAs and command counsel to confirm availability of the attorney.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) An attorney appointed by DA may represent a civilian employee in any proceeding initiated by OSC before the MSPB.
However, counsel provided by DA may not represent the employee in any proceeding initiated by DA, in any appeal from
a final decision by the MSPB, or in any collateral proceeding before any forum other than the MSPB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) OSC may not bring a disciplinary action before the MSPB against a military member. Accordingly, DA counsel will
not be required to represent the military member in any MSPB disciplinary proceeding. However, counsel may represent
the member during the OSC investigation with the understanding that the evidence obtained by OSC may be referred to
the member's command for possible disciplinary action under the UCMJ or appropriate regulations. If DA initiates
action against the military member for misconduct disclosed in the OSC investigation, the member will obtain counsel
as provided under the UCMJ or relevant regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) OSC requests for records must be in writing. The Labor Counselor will assist OSC representatives in identifying
the custodian of specific records sought during the inquiry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Generally, requested records should be furnished to OSC representatives if such records would be released under
AR 25&hyph;55 or AR 340&hyph;21 to other government agencies in the normal course of official business. Records constituting
attorney work product should not be released without approval of the Chief, DAJA-LE. IG records will not be released
without the approval of the Inspector General. (AR 20&hyph;1). The Labor Counselor should seek guidance from the
Chief, DAJA-LE, if there is any doubt concerning the release of records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If, after completion of the OSC investigation, the OSC files a complaint against DA or a DA employee, release of
records and other information will be accomplished pursuant to MSPB rules of discovery (5 CFR part 1201, subpart B).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Funding. The command, activity, or installation within which the allegations of misconduct arose will provide
funding for travel, per diem and other necessary expenses related to the OSC investigation. These expenses may include
appropriate funding for witnesses, counsel for consultation and DA General Counsel approved counsel for representation.

Exemption determination authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The commander exercising special court-martial convening authority (SPCMCA) over a unit has the authority to
determine whether a soldier of that unit, who has been served with a summons, is exempt from serving on a state or local
jury unless that authority has been limited or withheld in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. This
authority may not be delegated to a subordinate commander who does not exercise SPCMCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A commander superior to the SPCMCA, who also exercises SPCMCA or general court-martial convening authority (GCMCA)
over a unit, may limit or withhold the exemption determination authority of subordinate commanders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A GCMCA, who orders a unit or soldier assigned to one command to be attached or detailed to another command for disciplinary
purposes (for example, ``for administration'' or ``for administration of military justice''), may reserve exemption
determination authority to the commander exercising SPCMCA in the chain of command to which the unit or soldier is
assigned rather than the chain of command to which the unit or soldier is attached or detailed.

Procedures for exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Active duty soldiers served with a summons to serve on a state or local jury will promptly advise their commander
and provide copies of pertinent documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Unit commanders will evaluate the summons considering both the individual soldier's duties and the unit mission.
Coordination with the servicing judge advocate or legal adviser and with the appropriate state or local official
may be necessary to determine any impact on the soldier's duties or on unit readiness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the soldier is not exempt under &sect;516.75 (b) or (c), the commander will process the soldier for permissive
TDY in accordance with AR 630&hyph;5, Leaves and Passes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the soldier is exempt under &sect;516.75 (b) or (c), the commander will forward the summons and any related documentation,
with recommendations, through the chain of command to the commander with exemption determination authority over
the soldier concerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The commander with exemption determination authority over the soldier concerned will determine whether the
soldier is exempt. His determination is final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The exemption determination authority will notify responsible state or local officials whenever a soldier summoned
for jury duty is exempt. The notification will cite 10 U.S.C. 982 as authority.

(a) Soldiers who are required to comply with summons to serve on state or local juries will be placed on permissive TDY
under the provisions of AR 630&hyph;5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Jury fees accruing to soldiers for complying with the summons to serve on state and local juries must be turned over
to the appropriate finance office for deposit into the U.S. Treasury. Commands will establish procedures with local
authorities and their servicing finance and accounting activity to ensure that such jury fees are so deposited. Soldiers,
however, may keep any reimbursement from state or local authority for expenses incurred in the performance of jury
duty, including transportation, meals, and parking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Responsibilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
l. The General Counsel, Department of Defense (GC, DoD), shall provide general policy and procedural guidance by

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Authority to Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 a. In response to a litigation request or demand for official DoD information or the testimony of DoD personnel as witnesses,
the General Counsels of DoD, Navy, and the Defense Agencies; the Judge Advocates General of the Military Departments;
and the Chief Legal Advisors to the JCS and the Unified and Specified Commands, with regard to their respective Components,
are authorized_after consulting and coordinating with the appropriate Department of Justice litigation attorneys,
as required_to determine whether official information originated by the Component may be released in litigation;
whether DoD personnel assigned to or affiliated with the Component may be interviewed, contacted, or used as witnesses
concerning official DoD information or as expert witnesses; and what, if any, conditions will be imposed upon such
release, interview, contact, or testimony. Delegation of this authority, to include the authority to invoke appropriate
claims of privilege before any tribunal, is permitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. In the event that a DoD Component receives a litigation request or demand for official information originated by
another Component, the receiving Component shall forward the appropriate portions of the request or demand to the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Factors to Consider
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In deciding whether to authorize the release of official DoD information or the testimony of DoD personnel concerning
official information (hereinafter referred to as ``the disclosure'') pursuant to paragraph F.1., DoD officials
should consider the following types of factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Whether the request or demand is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable court rules;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Whether the disclosure, including release in camera, is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the
case or matter in which the request or demand arose; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Whether the disclosure would violate a statute, executive order, regulation, or directive; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Whether the disclosure, including release in camera, is appropriate or necessary under the relevant substantive
law concerning privilege; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Whether the disclosure, except when in camera and necessary to assert a claim of privilege, would reveal information
properly classified pursuant to the DoD Information Security Program under DoD 5200.1&hyph;R (reference (d)),
unclassified technical data withheld from public release pursuant to DoD Directive 5230.25 (reference (e)), or
other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Whether disclosure would interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights,
reveal the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, disclose trade secrets or similarly confidential
commercial or financial information, or otherwise be inappropriate under the circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Decisions on Litigation Requests and Demands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Subject to paragraph F.3.e., DoD personnel shall not, in response to a litigation request or demand, produce, disclose,
release, comment upon, or testify concerning any official DoD information without the prior written approval of
the appropriate DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. Oral approval may be granted, but a record of such approval
shall be made and retained in accordance with the applicable implementing regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. If official DoD information is sought, through testimony or otherwise, by a litigation request or demand, the individual
seeking such release or testimony must set forth, in writing and with as much specificity as possible, the nature and
relevance of the official information sought. Subject to paragraph F.3.e., DoD personnel may only produce, disclose,
release, comment upon, or testify concerning those matters that were specified in writing and properly approved
by the appropriate DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462
(1951). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Whenever a litigation request or demand is made upon DoD personnel for official DoD information or for testimony
concerning such information, the personnel upon whom the request or demand was made shall immediately notify the
DoD official designated in paragraph F.1. for the Component to which the individual contacted is or, for former personnel,
was last assigned. In appropriate cases, the responsible DoD official shall thereupon notify the Department of Justice
of the request or demands. After due consultation and coordination with the Department of Justice, as required, the
DoD official shall determine whether the individual is required to comply with the request or demand and shall notify
the requestor or the court or other authority of the determination reached. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. If, after DoD personnel have received a litigation request or demand and have in turn notified the appropriate DoD
official in accordance with paragraph F.3.c., a response to the request or demand is required before instructions
from the responsible official are received, the responsible official designated in paragraph F.1. shall furnish
the requestor or the court or other authority with a copy of this Directive and applicable implementing regulations,
inform the requestor or the court or other authority that the request or demand is being reviewed, and seek a stay of
the request or demand pending a final determination by the Component concerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. If a court of competent jurisdiction or other appropriate authority declines to stay the effect of the request or
demand in response to action taken pursuant to paragraph F.3.d., or if such court or other authority orders that the
request or demand must be complied with notwithstanding the final decision of the appropriate DoD official, the DoD
personnel upon whom the request or demand was made shall notify the responsible DoD official of such ruling or order.
If the DoD official determines that no further legal review of or challenge to the court's ruling or order will be sought,
the affected DoD personnel shall comply with the request, demand, or order. If directed by the appropriate DoD official,
however, the affected DoD personnel shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand. See United States ex rel.

4. Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the guidelines in DoD Instruction 7230.7 (reference (f)), the appropriate officials designated
in paragraph F.1. are authorized to charge reasonable fees, as established by regulation and to the extent not prohibited
by law, to parties seeking, by request or demand, official DoD information not otherwise available under the DoD Freedom
of Information Act Program (reference (g)). Such fees, in amounts calculated to reimburse the Government for the
expense of providing such information, may include the costs of time expended by DoD employees to process and respond
to the request or demand; attorney time for reviewing the request or demand and any information located in response
thereto and for related legal work in connection with the request or demand; and expenses generated by materials and
equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information. See Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders,
437 U.S. 340 (1978). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Expert or Opinion Testimony 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
DoD personnel shall not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony concerning official
DoD information, subjects, or activities, except on behalf of the United States or a party represented by the Department
of Justice. Upon a showing by the requestor of exceptional need or unique circumstances and that the anticipated testimony
will not be adverse to the interests of the Department of Defense or the United States, the appropriate DoD official
designated in paragraph F.1. may, in writing, grant special authorization for DoD personnel to appear and testify
at no expense to the United States. If, despite the final determination of the responsible DoD official, a court of
competent jurisdiction, or other appropriate authority, orders the appearance and expert or opinion testimony
of DoD personnel, the personnel shall notify the responsible DoD official of such order. If the DoD official determines
that no further legal review of or challenge to the court's order will be sought, the affected DoD personnel shall comply
with the order. If directed by the appropriate DoD official, however, the affected DoD personnel shall respectfully
decline to comply with the demand. See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is DoD policy that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each of the DoD Components shall monitor, from its inception, all significant investigations of fraud or corruption
related to procurement activities affecting its organizations, for the purpose of ensuring that all possible criminal,
civil, administrative, and contractual remedies in such cases are identified to cognizant procurement and command
officials and that appropriate remedies are pursued expeditiously. This process shall include appropriate coordination
with all other affected DoD Components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. All investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities shall be reviewed to determine and
implement the appropriate contractual and administrative actions that are necessary to recover funds lost through
fraud or corruption and to ensure the integrity of DoD programs and operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Appropriate civil, contractual, and administrative actions, including those set forth in enclosure 1, shall
be taken expeditiously. During an investigation and before prosecution or litigation, and when based in whole or
in part on evidence developed during an investigation, such actions shall be taken with the advance knowledge of the
responsible DoD criminal investigative organization and, when necessary, the appropriate legal counsel in the
Department of Defense and the Department of Justice (DoJ). When appropriate, such actions shall be taken before final
resolution of the criminal or civil case.

To overcome Federal statutory restrictions on the disclosure of the requested file imposed by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C.
&sect;552a, you must provide either a written release authorization signed by the individual to whom the file pertains
(that is, SSG Kramer) or a court ordered release signed by a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction. A subpoena signed
by a clerk of court, notary, or other official is insufficient.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, because of the attorney-client relationship between Captain Selby and SSG Kramer, you must produce
a written waiver of the attorney-client privilege from SSG Kramer. Because the privilege may protect both documents
and testimony, Captain Selby may not divulge such information without SSG Kramer's consent.

In addition to the above requirements, Captain Selby's supervisor must approve her absence from duty.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 32 CFR &sect;516.43. In this regard, we suggest you take the deposition at Fort Smith. In any event, however, you or
your client must pay all travel expenses, as this is purely private litigation and witness' appearance must be at no

Finally, if Captain Selby does appear as a witness, she may only give factual testimony. She may not testify as an opinion

employees from appearing as expert witnesses in private litigation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subject to the following conditions, your request is approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This grant of authority is limited to factual testimony only. Captain Sawyer may not testify as an expert witness.
This limitation is based on Army policy prohibiting Government employees from appearing as expert witnesses in private
litigation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 32 CFR &sect;516.42. Captain Sawyer may not provide official information that is classified, privileged, or otherwise
protected from public disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision whether to testify in private litigation is within the discretion of the prospective witness. This authorization
is also subject to the approval of the witness' supervisors to be absent during the period involved. Finally, because
this is private litigation, the witness' participation must be at no expense to the United States.

Dear Mr. Taylor: This responds to your request for Mr. Charles Montrose to appear as an expert witness in private litigation:
Smithers 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
ABC Video.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 For the following reasons, the request is denied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Army Regulation 27&hyph;40 forbids Army personnel from providing expert testimony in private litigation, with
or without compensation, except under the most extraordinary circumstances. See 32 CFR &sect;&sect;97.6(e), 516.42.
Several reasons support the exercise of strict control over such witness appearances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Army policy is one of strict impartiality in litigation in which the Army is not a named party, a real party in interest,
or in which the Army does not have a significant interest. When a witness with an official connection with the Army testifies,
a natural tendency exists to assume that the testimony represents the official view of the Army, despite express disclaimers
to the contrary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Army is also interested in preventing the unnecessary loss of the services of its personnel in connection with
matters unrelated to their official responsibilities. If Army personnel testify as expert witnesses in private
litigation, their official duties are invariably disrupted, often at the expense of the Army's mission and the Federal
taxpayer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Army is concerned about the potential for conflict of interest inherent in the unrestricted appearance
of its personnel as expert witnesses on behalf of parties other than the United States. Even the appearance of such
conflicts of interest seriously undermines the public trust and confidence in the integrity of our Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This case does not present the extraordinary circumstances necessary to justify the requested witness' expert testimony.
You have demonstrated no exceptional need or unique circumstances that would warrant (his or her) appearance. The
expert testimony desired can be secured from non-Army sources. Consequently, we are unable to grant you an exception
to the Army's policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If you have any questions, please call me or CPT Taylor at 919&hyph;882&hyph;4500.

Dear Mr. Taylor: This responds to your request to depose Dr. (MAJ) J. McDonald, Fort Smith Medical Treatment Facility.
Pursuant to 32 CFR &sect;&sect;516.33&hyph;516.49, you may depose him subject to the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
He may testify as to his treatment of his patient, Sergeant Rock, as to related laboratory tests he may have conducted,
or other actions he took in the regular course of his duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
He must limit his testimony to factual matters such as his observations of the patient or other operative facts, the
treatment prescribed or corrective action taken, course of recovery or steps required for treatment of injuries
suffered, or contemplated future treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
His testimony may not extend to hypothetical questions or to a prognosis. He may not testify as an ``expert.'' This
limitation is based on Department of Defense and Army policy prohibiting present or former military personnel and
Army civilian employees from providing opinion or expert testimony concerning official information, subjects,
or activities in private litigation. See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 32 CFR &sect;&sect;97.6(e), 516.42. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witnesses may not provide official information that is classified, privileged, or otherwise protected from
public disclosure. To protect the Army's interests, CPT Taylor or another Army attorney will be present during the
depositions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To overcome restrictions imposed by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect;552a, Dr. McDonald may not discuss matters derived
from the patient's medical records absent the patient's written consent or a court order signed by a judge. A subpoena
issued by someone other than a judge or magistrate is insufficient.

e. Mandatory stock levels and inventory requirements appear excessive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Items appear to be unnecessarily declared excess or sold as surplus, while same items are being reprocured.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. It appears that an item or service is being purchased more as a result of aggressive marketing efforts rather than
in response to a valid requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Need determination appears to be unnecessarily tailored in ways that can only be met by certain contractors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Items and services are continually obtained from the same source due to an unwarranted lack of effort to develop
second sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. During the development of the statements of work and specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Statements of work and specifications appear to be intentionally written to fit the products or capabilities of
a single contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Statements of work, specifications, or sole source justifications developed by or in consultation with a preferred
contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Information concerning requirements and pending contracts is released only to preferred contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Allowing companies and industry personnel who participated in the preparation of bid packages to perform on subsequent
contracts in either a prime or subcontractor capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Release of information by firms or personnel participating in design or engineering to companies competing for
prime contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Prequalification standards or specifications appear designed to exclude otherwise qualified contractors or
their productions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Requirements appear split up to allow for rotating bids, giving each contractor his or her ``fair share.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Requirements appear split up to meet small purchase requirements (that is, $25,000) or to avoid higher levels of
approval that would be otherwise required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Bid specifications or statement of work appear inconsistent with the items described in the general requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Specifications appear so vague that reasonable comparisons of estimate would be difficult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. Specifications appear inconsistent with previous procurements of similar items of services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. During the presolicitation phase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Sole source justifications appear unnecessary or poorly supported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Statements justifying sole source or negotiated procurements appear inadequate or incredible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Solicitation documents appear to contain unnecessary requirements which tend to restrict competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Contractors or their representatives appear to have received advanced information related to the proposed procurement
on a preferential basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. During the solicitation phase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Procurement appears to be processed so as to exclude or impede certain contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The time for submission of bids appears to be unnecessarily limited so that only those with advance information
have adequate time to prepare bids or proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. It appears that information concerning the procurement has been revealed only to certain contractors, without
being revealed to all prospective competitors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Bidders conferences are conducted in a way that apparently invites bid rigging, price fixing, or other improper
collusion between contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. There is an apparent intentional failure to fairly publish notice of the solicitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Solicitation appears vague as to the details such as time, place and manner, of submitting acceptable bids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. There is evidence of improper communications or social contract between contractors and government personnel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Controls over the number and destination of bid packages sent to interested bidders appear inadequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Indications that government personnel or their families may own stock or have some other financial interest in
either a contractor or subcontractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Indications that government personnel are discussing possible employment for themselves or a family member with
a contractor or subcontractor or indications that a proposal for future employment from a contractor or subcontractor
to a government employee or his or her family members has not been firmly rejected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Testing Defective Items Under Criminal or Civil Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Under no circumstances is testing to proceed unless the command has committed sufficient funding to cover the entire
cost of the projected testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. No testing will be initiated unless there has been a written request for the testing to the appropriate Procurement
Fraud Advisor from a criminal investigator or Assistant United States Attorney or Department of Justice Attorney
(AUSA is used in these procedures to indicate either an AUSA or Department of Justice attorney). If they have not already
done so, criminal investigators should be requested to coordinate their testing requests with the AUSA overseeing
the investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Barring extraordinary circumstances, only one test will be conducted to support the criminal and civil recovery
efforts of a procurement fraud/irregularity matter. Early coordination with the Civil Division of Department of
Justice or the local United States Attorneys Office is necessary to ensure that testing funds are not wasted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The request for testing should include a clear, concise statement of the purpose of the testing to include a statement
of the allegations made and the contact number(s) involved. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Any test plan which requires destructive testing must be approved by the AUSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. No testing will be initiated unless a test plan has been developed which states the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 -->
a. the contract number(s) involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. the National Stock Number (NSN) of the item to be tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. the purpose of the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. the alleged defect or the contractual requirement violated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. the CID report of investigation (ROI) number or the DCIS case number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. cost of the test (a cost proposal should be an attachment to the test plan) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. where the test will be conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. how the test will be conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. the name and telephone number of the test team leader 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. the names of all test team members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. the approximate dates of the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
l. the date that completion of the test is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
m. a clear statement of the desired product (that is test report, raw data, analysis of results, evaluation of test
results) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
n. the PRON to fund the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
o. a retention plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
6. The test plan shall be coordinated with the concurrence received in advance from the appropriate personnel in the
Procurement Directorate, Product Assurance and Test Directorate, the Procurement Fraud Advisor, and the investigator/AUSA
requesting the test. No testing will be initiated until the criminal investigator/AUSA who requested the testing
has approved the test plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. If the items tested are to be retained as evidence, the criminal investigator should arrange for retention of the
evidence. While the Command will support evidence retention, this is primarily the responsibility of the criminal
investigators. Agents should be advised that putting items in Code L or similar non-use status is insufficient to
protect it from being released to the field. A decision not to retain the tested items as evidence must have the approval
of the AUSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. All items to be tested should be from a statistically valid random sample. The sample should conform with the inspection
requirements of the contract or be in conformance with a random sample specifically developed for the instant test
plan. It is recommended that a statistician be consulted to determine the feasibility of a random sample specifically
created to support the test plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Results of testing should be available to Command and DA personnel for appropriate contractual and administrative
remedies. Any request for testing results that indicates that dissemination of the testing results will be limited
by Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is to be forwarded through the MACOM or AMC Procurement Fraud
Coordinator to DA Procurement Fraud Division prior to the initiation of any testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Resolution of problems associated with testing requests should be conducted at the local level. In AMC the authority
to refuse a testing request resides with the Office of Command Counsel. Any disputes which cannot be resolved at the
local level will be forwarded to the AMC or MACOM Procurement Fraud Coordinator for resolution. This includes disputes
regarding funding or any time sensitive issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Second requests for testing of the same item due to a change in the investigative plan require coordination by the
PFA with the investigator and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 AUSA overseeing the investigation to determine the deficiencies in the earlier test. Disputes which cannot be resolved
between the AUSA, PFA, and investigator regarding testing are to be forwarded simultaneously to the MACOM Procurement
Fraud Coordinator and PFD for resolution. The procedures established in paragraphs 5 and 6 apply for second requests
for testing with the additional requirement that the Assistant United States Attorney must be requested to approve
the test plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
Guide for Seeking Legal Advice and Representation Before Office of Special Counsel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. DA employees or military members asked to provide information (testimonial or documentary) to OSC may obtain legal
advice through the Labor Counselor from DA attorneys concerning their rights and obligations. This includes assistance
at any interviews with OSC investigators. However, an attorney-client relationship will not be established unless
the employee or military member_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is suspected or accused by the OSC of committing a prohibited personnel practice or other illegal or improper act;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Has been assigned counsel by the DA General Counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Any military member or employee who reasonably believes that he or she is suspected or has been accused by OSC of committing
a prohibited personnel practice or other illegal or improper act may obtain legal representation from DA. The counsel
assigned will be from another DOD component whenever a DA attorney is likely to face a conflict between the attorney's
ethical obligation to the client and DA, or when the suspected or accused individual has requested representation
from another DOD component. Outside legal counsel may be retained by DA on behalf of the member or employee under unusual
circumstances and only with the personal approval of the DOD General Counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The DA General Counsel will determine whether a conflict is likely to occur if a DA attorney is assigned to represent
a military member or civilian. If the DA General Counsel determines a conflict may occur, or if the suspected or accused
employee has requested representation from another DOD component, the DA General Counsel will seek the assistance
of another General Counsel in obtaining representation outside DA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Requests for Representation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. To obtain legal representation, military members or civilian employees must_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Submit a written request for legal representation through the Labor and Employment Law Office, Office of the Judge
Advocate General, Department of the Army, to DA General Counsel, explaining the circumstances that justify legal
representation. Copies of all process and pleadings served should accompany the request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Indicate whether private counsel, at personal expense, has been retained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Obtain written certification from their supervisor that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) They were acting within the scope of official duties; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) DA has not initiated any adverse or disciplinary action against them for the conduct being investigated by the
OSC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Requests for DA legal representation must be approved by the DA General Counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The conditions of legal representation must be explained and accepted in writing by the member or employee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Limitations on Representation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. DA will not provide legal representation with respect to a DA initiated disciplinary action against a civilian
employee for committing or participating in a prohibited personnel practice or for engaging in illegal or improper
conduct. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the participation or conduct is also the basis for the disciplinary
action proposed by the OSC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. In certain situations, counsel provided by DA may be limited to representing the individual only with respect to
some of the pending matters, if other specific matters of concern to the OSC or MSPB do not satisfy the requirements
contained in this regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Attorney-Client Relationship
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. An attorney-client relationship will be established and continued between the suspected or accused individual
and assigned DA counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. In representing a DA employee or military member, the DA attorney designated as counsel will act as a vigorous advocate
of the individual's legal interests before the OSC or MSPB. The attorney's professional responsibility to DA will
be satisfied by fulfilling this responsibility to the employee or military member. Legal representation may be terminated
only with the approval of the DA General Counsel and normally only on the basis of information not available at the time
the attorney was assigned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The attorney-client relationship may be terminated if the assigned DA counsel determines, with the approval of
the DA General Counsel, that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The military member or civilian employee was acting outside the scope of his or her official duties when engaging
in the conduct that is the basis for the OSC investigation or charge; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Termination is not in violation of the rules of professional conduct applicable to the assigned counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The DA attorney designated as counsel may request relief from the duties of representation or counseling without
being required to furnish explanatory information that might compromise confidential communications between
the client and the attorney. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Funding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation authorizes cognizant DA officials to approve requests from military members or civilian employees
for travel, per diem, witness appearances, or other departmental support necessary to ensure effective legal representation
by the designated counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Status
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A military member's or civilian employee's participation in OSC investigations, MSPB hearings, and other related
proceedings will be considered official departmental business for time and attendance requirements and similar
purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Advice to Witnesses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following advice to military members and civilian employees questioned during the course of an OSC investigation
may be appropriate in response to these frequent inquiries:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A witness may decline to provide a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer in favor of a more qualified answer when this is necessary
to ensure accuracy in responding to an OSC interviewer's question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Requests for clarification of both questions and answers are appropriate to avoid misinterpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Means to ensure verifications of an interview by OSC investigators are appropriate, whether or not the military
member or civilian employee is accompanied by counsel. Tape recorders may only be used for this purpose when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recorder is used in full view.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All attendees are informed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The OSC investigator agrees to record the proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Any errors that appear in a written summary of an interview prepared by the investigator should be corrected before
the member or employee signs the statement. The military member or civilian employee is not required to sign any written
summary that is not completely accurate. A military member or civilian employee may receive a copy of the summary as
a condition of signing.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Labor is issuing these regulations pursuant to the requirements of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Circular No. A&hyph;110 (Revised), which provides standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity
among Federal agencies in the administration of grants and agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals,
and other non-profit organizations. This rule also applies to the Department of Labor's grants to commercial organizations,
foreign governments, organizations under the jurisdiction of foreign governments and international organizations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB issued Circular A&hyph;110 in 1976 and, except for a minor revision in February 1987, the Circular remained unchanged
until revised in 1993. To update the Circular, OMB established an interagency task force to review the Circular. The
task force solicited suggestions for changes to the Circular from university groups, non-profit organizations
and other interested parties and compared for consistency the provisions of similar provisions applied to State
and local governments. The revised Circular and these regulations reflect the results of these efforts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 39018) on August 27, 1992, requesting comments on proposed revisions to OMB Circular A&hyph;110. Interested
parties were invited to submit comments. OMB received over 200 comments from Federal agencies, non-profit organizations,
professional organizations and others. All comments were considered in developing this final revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 29, 1993, at 58 FR 62992, OMB published a notice containing its final revision to Circular A&hyph;110.
In that publication, OMB presented a summary of the major comments, grouped by subject, and a response to each comment.
Other changes were made to increase clarity and readability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Omitted from part 95 are requirements which DOL must meet pursuant to the Circular. Those requirements deal with the
relationship between DOL and OMB and are not necessary to this rulemaking. OMB Circular A&hyph;110 gives Federal
agencies the discretion to make these regulations applicable to grants and agreements awarded to commercial organizations,
foreign governments, organizations under the jurisdiction of foreign governments, and international organizations.
The Department of Labor has chosen to do so. As permitted by OMB Circular A&hyph;110, the Department has made a few changes
to the language of the Circular to fit the particular circumstances of the DOL programs. The Department has added a
definition of ``commercial organizations'' and revised the definition of ``program income'' for clarification
purposes. The Department also has revised the language in &sect;95.25(e)(2), dealing with extensions, for editorial
purposes. The Department has deleted the words ``at least'' from &sect;95.22(e)(2) to enhance administrative efficiency
by limiting invoicing to once a month. Other minor editorial, technical, and clarifying changes are made as well.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Publication in Final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Labor has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that good cause exists for waiving public
comment on this procedural amendment to the regulation because such comment is unnecessary, impracticable, and
contrary to the public interest. This finding is made because all executive agencies are required to follow OMB directives
with respect to grants or assistance of property. See 41 U.S.C. &sect;405 (The Office of Federal Procurement Policy
Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has determined that good cause exists for waiving the customary requirement for delay in the effective
date of a final rule for 30 days following its publication. Therefore, this rule shall be effective July 27, 1994. See
5 U.S.C. 553. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Procedural Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined by section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. Since this
rule was not preceded by a proposed rule, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. See 5 U.S.C. 601(2). Further,
the Department of Labor certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities, because it does not affect the amount of funds provided in the covered programs, but, rather, modifies
and updates administrative and procedural requirements. The recordkeeping requirements in this rule have been
approved by the Office of Management and Budget, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, Approval Number 1225&hyph;0017.

The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205), declares that
the metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency
to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement
will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation
may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies
in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. DOL shall follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage
in Federal Government Programs.''

Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94&hyph;580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State
agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with Section
6002. Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products
containing recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
(40 CFR parts 247&hyph;254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education, hospitals, and non-profit
organizations that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement
programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program
in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in &sect;95.52. Though DOL requires reporting on an accrual
basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required
to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop such accrual data for its reports on the basis
of an analysis of the documentation on hand.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These
records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,
assets, outlays, income and interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately
safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should
be related to performance and unit cost data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury
and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient.
To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;453) govern, payment
methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements
or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under
Federal Grant and Other Programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, DOL, at its
discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient
are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) DOL may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the
Federal Government's interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business

State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures
codified at 31 CFR part 205. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient,
and

Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance
with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved
program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the
actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share
of any allowable indirect costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF&hyph;270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,''
or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to
the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special DOL instructions
for electronic funds transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. DOL
may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished
through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the
project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When the reimbursement method is used, DOL shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless
the billing is improper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Recipients are authorized to submit requests for reimbursement monthly when electronic funds transfers are
not used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and DOL has determined that reimbursement is not feasible
because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, DOL may provide cash on a working capital advance basis.
Under this procedure, DOL shall advance cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial
period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, DOL shall reimburse the recipient for its
actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling
or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on
a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned
on such funds before requesting additional cash payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, DOL shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at
any time during the project period unless paragraphs (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal
reporting requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A&hyph;129,
``Managing Federal Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, DOL may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient
that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected
or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, DOL shall not require separate depository
accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds
provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure
of funds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business
enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at
least 50 percent by women or minority group members). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraph (k)(1),
(k)(2), or (k)(3) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250
per year on Federal cash balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected
Federal and non-Federal cash resources.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In keeping with Electronic Funds Transfer rules, (31 CFR Part 206), interest should be remitted to the HHS Payment
Management System through an electronic medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients who do not have this
capability should use a check. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances
deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment
Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient
for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest.
If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written
approval from DOL, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting
advances and reimbursements. DOL shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. The SF&hyph;270 is the standard form for all nonconstruction
programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. DOL, however, has the option
of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF&hyph;271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement
for Construction Programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) SF&hyph;271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The SF&hyph;271 is the
standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, DOL may 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
substitute
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the SF&hyph;270 when DOL determines that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Are not included as contributions for any other Federally-assisted project or program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used
for cost sharing or matching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by DOL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with prior written approval
of the grant officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable
cost principles. If DOL authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition
projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of the
value determined under paragraph (c)(1) or paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the
time of donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the grant officer may approve
the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of
donation to the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled
labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project
or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization.
In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent
with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved.
In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued
at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable,
but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally
paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop
and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be
reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title
passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section
apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total
value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally
only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other
capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the grant officer has approved the charges.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient,
with the following qualifications: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient
as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration
representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition
at the time of donation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent
appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third
parties: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient
for its own employees.

(5) The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs, or vice versa. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The inclusion, unless waived by the grant officer, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB
Circular A&hyph;21, ``Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,'' OMB Circular A 122, ``Cost Principles
for Non-Profit Organizations,'' or 45 CFR part 74, Appendix E, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to
Research and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,'' or 48 CFR part 31, ``Contract Cost Principles

OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, the grant officer may waive cost-related
and administrative prior written approvals required by this part and OMB Circulars A&hyph;21 and A&hyph;122. Such
waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior written approval

anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following
conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the grant officer in writing with the supporting

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) DOL may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and
activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such
transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by DOL. DOL shall not permit
a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent
with the original intent of the appropriation.

the recipient to request prior written approval before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of
work supported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, recipients shall notify the grant officer in writing promptly
whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period
by more than $5,000 or five percent of the award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required if an
application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) When requesting written approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in
the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, the grant officer shall review

For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of
costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus,
allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined
in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;87, ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.''
The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions
of OMB Circular A&hyph;122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' The allowability of costs incurred
by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;21, ``Cost
Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance
with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and
Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations
and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A&hyph;122 is determined in accordance with

Sections 95.31 through 95.37 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished
by the Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. Recipients are required
to observe these standards under awards and no additional requirements shall be imposed, unless specifically required
by Federal statute. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided it observes
the provisions of &sect;&sect;95.31 through 95.37.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOL shall prescribe requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired in
whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, such requirements, at a minimum, shall contain
the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real
property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without
approval of DOL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The recipient shall obtain prior written approval from the grant officer for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored
projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project.
Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that
have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by DOL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the recipient shall
request disposition instructions from the grant officer. The grant officer shall issue one or more of the following
disposition instructions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates
the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal
participation in the project.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by DOL and pay DOL for that percentage
of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting
actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized
or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that provide for competition to the
extent practicable and result in the highest possible return. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third
party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage
of the current fair market value of the property.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Federally-owned property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually
an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to DOL. Upon completion of the award or when the
property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to DOL for further Federal agency utilization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) If DOL has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration,
unless DOL has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided
by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit
organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, ``Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National
Education Goals.'') Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by DOL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Exempt property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When statutory authority exists, DOL has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient
without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions DOL considers appropriate. Such property
is ``exempt property.'' Should DOL not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest
in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside
organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically
authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without
approval of the grant officer. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the
equipment in connection with its other federally, sponsored activities, in the following order of priority: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Activities sponsored by the DOL agency which funded the original project, then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make
it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or
program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other
projects or programs sponsored by the DOL agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to
projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government,
use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the grant officer.
User charges shall be treated as program income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the
equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the written approval of
the grant officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned
equipment shall include all of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A description of the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification
number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least
once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in
the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection
with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment.
Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the
Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the grant officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established
which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance
with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5,000 or more, the recipient
may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original DOL agency. The amount of
compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project
or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient
shall request disposition instructions from DOL. The DOL agency shall determine whether the equipment can be used
to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within the DOL agency, the availability of the equipment
shall be reported to the General Services Administration by DOL to determine whether a requirement for the equipment
exists in other Federal agencies. DOL shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after
the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's
request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse DOL an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds
the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall
be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for
the recipient's selling and handling expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal
Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost
of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping
or interim storage costs incurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the
awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The DOL agency reserves the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the
Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject
to the following standards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The DOL agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory.
The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If DOL fails
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the recipient shall apply the standards of
this section, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When DOL exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-owned
equipment.

in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and the recipient
shall not encumber the property without written approval of the grant officer. When no longer needed for the originally
authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of &sect;95.34(g).

Purpose of procurement standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 95.41 through 95.48 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement
of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These
standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance
with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or
requirements shall be imposed by DOL upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive
order or approved by OMB.

Recipient responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising
under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to DOL, regarding the settlement
and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support
of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters
of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local
authority as may have proper jurisdiction.

Codes of conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in
the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award,
or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved.
Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her
partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial
or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither
solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements.
However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift
is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied
for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.

Competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and
free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive
practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to
ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop
or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals
shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer
is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered.
Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid
or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest
to do so.

(a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum,
that paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Recipients shall avoid purchasing unnecessary items. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where appropriate, an analysis shall be made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the
most economical and practical procurement for the Federal Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Solicitations for goods and services shall provide for all of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured.
In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance
required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items
are included in the solicitation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in
the metric system of measurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural
resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's
business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further
this goal: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest
extent practicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts
to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises
when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration,
the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency, and DOL's Office of Small Business and Minority
Affairs in the solicitation and utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase
orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular
procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost''
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully
under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor
integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources.
In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by agencies' implementation of E.O.'s
12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' See 29 CFR part 98. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available to DOL, pre-award and procurement documents, such as request for
proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently $25,000)
and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under
a sealed bid procurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than
the amount of the small purchase threshold.

Contract provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions
in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that
allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches
the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by
the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition,
such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction
or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees,
performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those
contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, DOL may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient,
provided DOL has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination
has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist
of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance
that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the
time specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is
one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed
in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material
in the execution of the work provided for in the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding
certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business
with the United States.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall
include a provision to the effect that the recipient, DOL, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their
duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor
which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) DOL shall prescribe the frequency with which performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in paragraph
(f) of this section, performance reports shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently
than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual reports
shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. DOL may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple-year
awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the
following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings
of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified,
such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high
unit costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Recipients shall immediately notify DOL of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported
activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially
impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken
or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) DOL may make site visits, as needed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A, Financial Status Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) Recipients shall use the SF&hyph;269, SF&hyph;269A, or other OMB-approved forms to report the status of funds
for all nonconstruction projects or programs. DOL may, however, have the option of not requiring the SF&hyph;269
or SF&hyph;269A when the SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash
Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF&hyph;269 or
SF&hyph;269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF&hyph;270 is used only for advances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) DOL shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or an accrual basis. If DOL requires accrual information
and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not convert
its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of
the documentation on hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) DOL shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the
size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently
than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When funds are advanced to recipients, the recipient shall submit the SF&hyph;272 and, when necessary, its continuation
sheet, SF&hyph;272a. DOL shall use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement
information for each agreement with the recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) DOL may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, DOL may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section the amount
of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations of actions
taken to reduce the excess balances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Recipients shall submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF&hyph;272 15 calendar days following
the end of each quarter. The DOL agency may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances totaling
$1 million or more per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) DOL may waive the requirement for submission of the SF&hyph;272 for any one of the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through
other forms contained in this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If, in DOL's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances;
or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When DOL needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, DOL shall issue instructions
to require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' section of the reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When DOL determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in &sect;95.21, additional
pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time
as the system is brought up to standard. DOL, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements
of 5 CFR part 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) DOL may shade out any line item on any report if not necessary.

(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall
be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that
are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as
authorized by DOL. The only exceptions are the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained
until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by DOL, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the
recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc., as specified in paragraph (g) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by DOL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) DOL shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records
possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, DOL may make arrangements
for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Federal grantor awarding agency, the Inspector General, the Comptroller General of the United States, or
any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents,
papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts,
transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's
personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph
are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Unless required by statute, DOL shall not place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records
of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when DOL can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential
and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. &sect;552) if the
records had belonged to DOL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply
to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals,
cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is
chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to DOL or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the
proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period
for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not required to submit to DOL or the subrecipient is not required
to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention
period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year
(or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination
of an award are not allowable unless DOL expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently.
Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are
allowable if paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section apply.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule clarifies, updates and modifies existing regulations on the management of cabins on national wildlife
refuges (refuges) in Alaska. These regulations are necessary in order to comply with the National Wildlife Refuge
System Administration Act of 1966 and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA) concerning
the administration of cabins on Alaska refuges. These regulations are being revised to ensure proper and uniform
management of all cabins on national wildlife refuges in Alaska. In addition, a technical amendment is made to eliminate
reference to sections regarding general provisions which have been removed earlier.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 1303 and 1315 of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 3193 and 3203) allow the Secretary of the Interior to permit cabins on refuges
in Alaska under certain conditions. Section 304 of ANILCA reemphasizes the authority of the Secretary to prescribe
such regulations as necessary to ensure the compatibility of uses with refuge purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original cabin policy for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) was developed in 1981 and revised in 1984.
This policy was the basis for regulations printed in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 50. In September 1987, the
Service, believing revisions of the existing cabin policy and regulations were needed, published a Draft Cabin Management
Policy for Cabins on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska. The purpose of the cabin policy is to provide uniform guidance
to both the public and refuge managers on human use and occupancy of cabins located on refuges in Alaska. The policy
further serves to define under what conditions use and occupancy of a cabin may be compatible with the purposes for
which the refuge was established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments and suggestions on the draft policy were solicited during a 60-day public review period. The Service made
extensive revisions in response to the comments. Because of the number and nature of revisions made, the Service published
a revised draft of the policy in December 1988 to give the public another opportunity to comment before the policy was
made final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised draft was completely reorganized. It better described the objectives of the policy and set forth the guidelines
needed to comply with ANILCA and the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. The comment period
for the revised draft was also 60 days. The final cabin policy was issued in August, 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next step in the process was to publish proposed rules to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the
rulemaking process and solicit public comment. A proposed rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 25, 1991 (56 FR 19074). The proposed rule had a 60 day public comment period and public hearings were held in
Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both the proposed and the final rules contain significantly more guidance relating to cabin management than existing
regulations. However, only minor changes are made in permit application procedures. The existing requirement that
individuals apply for nontransferable renewable five year special use permits is retained. However, this final
rule requires two additional items (date of construction or acquisition of the cabin and the dimensions of the cabin
and related structures) to be submitted in the application. In addition to the increased application requirements,
the rule has additional requirements of permittees such as getting permission from the refuge manager before major
modification or rehabilitation is conducted on existing cabins.

Summary of Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four persons presented oral comments at the public hearings and the Service received an additional eight letters
providing written comments from the public. A number of changes were made in the final rule from the proposed rule after
consideration of all public comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments requested changes that were 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
made, however, and the Service first addresses these comments as noted below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Exemptions for Certain Types of Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations should exempt facilities such as headquarters sites, visitor centers, and state facilities used
to support fish and wildlife related management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the Service's position that cabins used by the State for support of fish and wildlife related management are administrative
cabins and should not be exempted from the regulations. Visitor centers and headquarters sites do not need to be exempted
since they are not within the scope of the cabin regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final cabin regulations should address rights of access. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service does not believe it is necessary to repeat such language in the cabin regulations since the intent of ANILCA
Section 1110(a) regarding access is already articulated in 50 CFR 36.12 and 43 CFR Part 36. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Definition of Family and Immediate Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``family'' should be broadened and the definition of ``immediate family'' should be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definitions, as proposed, fully meet the intent of ANILCA Section 1303(c)(1) regarding permit renewal for the
life of claimants and immediate family. The definition of ``immediate family'' was broadened by deleting ``legal''
from the term ``legal spouse.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) Public Use of Seasonally Permitted Cabins 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``public use cabin'' should be revised to allow seasonally permitted cabins to also be used as public
use cabins during the other parts of the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service does not have the authority to allow use of ``existing'' cabins which are privately owned. Although ``new''
cabins are government property, the permittees usually have a considerable amount of private property in and around
the cabin. The Service does not believe it is reasonable to make the permittees' private belongings accessible to
the public or require the permittees to seasonally remove all of their property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(e) Permits for New Cabins Generally Only for Subsistence Purposes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language ``In general, new cabin permits will be given only to local residents to pursue a legitimate subsistence
activity[.]'' should be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This statement meets the intent of ANILCA and the Service believes it is appropriate to include in the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(f) Construction and Use of Cabins in Wilderness Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language which only allows new cabins to be constructed in wilderness areas that are built specifically for the
administration of the area, for public safety, or for trapping where trapping has been a traditional and customary
use should be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language as proposed meets the intent of the Wilderness Act, as well as ANILCA, and is appropriate to include in
the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(g) Guests in Cabins 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There was some objection to the requirement that guests occupying a cabin during the absence of the permittee are required
to obtain a letter of authorization from the permittee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unauthorized use and vandalism of permitted cabins has been a problem in the past. The Service believes this is a reasonable
requirement to reduce the problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(h) Recreational Use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter recommended revising the language ``No special use permit will be issued for the construction of a cabin
for private recreational use or for the private recreational use of an existing cabin'' in order to comply with a recent
court case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language as proposed does comply with the decision of the court. The case simply made it clear that permittees and
their guests have the right to recreate while occupying cabins for which permits were issued for purposes other than
recreation.

(i) Nontransferable Permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It was recommended that permits for existing cabins be transferable to another person at the election or death of the
original permittee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nontransferability is a condition of all Service special use permits, regardless of the use being authorized. The
requirement is consistent with ANILCA and is appropriate to be included in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(j) Compatibility Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The criteria for determining cabin compatibility should be included in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Compatibility determinations are site specific and relate directly to the specific purposes for which each refuge
was established. The 16 refuges established/redesignated by ANILCA have different purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(k) Relationship of Proposed Regulations With Policy

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The intent, clarifications, and directions in the Service's cabin policy should be included in the regulations or
be adopted by reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service's cabin policy was widely distributed to the public and is available by request to all interested parties.
Some of the information in the policy is of a subjective nature which is not appropriate for regulations. All elements
of the Service's cabin policy that were determined to be appropriate as regulatory language were included in the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(l) Environmental Protection Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Language should be included that recognizes there are other Federal and State regulations governing environmental
compliance with activities associated with cabins (e.g., disposal of sewage and solid waste, drinking water, fuel
storage, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Standard conditions of all special use permits issued by the Service require the permittees to follow other applicable
State and Federal regulations. Therefore, the inclusion of regulatory language referencing other applicable regulations
is not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(m) Late Application for Existing Cabins 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirement that claimants who fail to meet application deadlines for ``existing'' cabins (within one year from
the date these regulations are published) will only be allowed to apply for ``new'' cabins, no matter when the cabin
was built or first used should be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations provide a one year application period following the effective date of the regulations. The Service
believes that the deadline is reasonable since regulations requiring the permits have been in place since 1981 and
considerable time and effort has been expended in notifying cabin occupants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(n) Other Related Structures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definition of ``other related structures'' should be revised to clarify that the term only includes those structures
in the vicinity and directly related to the operation of a cabin. The commenter also requested clarification that
temporary facilities may also occur under other regulations unrelated to the cabin regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service believes that the context of the definition makes it clear that the other related structures only include
those associated with cabins. A statement that temporary facilities may be authorized under other regulations is
irrelevant to the cabin regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We appreciate these comments; however, as noted, the Service did not make substantive changes to reflect such requests
for revisions for the reasons stated above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following is a section by section analysis of all substantive changes that the Service made in the final rule.

A provision was included in paragraph (1) regarding the privileges and rights of existing cabin users in response
to one comment. The period for applications for permits for existing cabins which are not currently under a valid permit
was revised from 90 days to one year following the effective date of these regulations. This was done in response to
two comments. Vandalism was included in paragraph (5) as a cause to reconstruct existing cabins in response to one
comment.

Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The impact of these regulations on subsistence uses has been evaluated as required by Section 810 of ANILCA. Subsistence
use and access are expected to differ little from existing use. The regulations are consistent with the purposes and
intent of Section 810 and will result in no significant restrictions on subsistence activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Properly regulated and managed cabin use is consistent with the purposes for which the various refuges in Alaska were
established.

National Environmental Policy Act Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The promulgation of these cabin management regulations would generally maintain the status quo existing under the
current rules. Additionally, changes in environmental effects would be negligible. Therefore the implementation
of regulations relative to cabin management on refuges in Alaska is determined to be a categorical exclusion as detailed
in the Department of Interior Manual (516 DM 6, Appendix 1). An Environmental Action Memorandum documenting this
decision was signed on June 7, 1990.

Economic Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rulemaking was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. A review under
the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) has been done to determine whether the rulemaking would have a significant effect on a substantial number of small
entities, which include businesses, organizations or governmental jurisdictions. This rulemaking would have
no significant effect on such entities as, in most cases, this merely continues pre-existing uses of public lands.

All cabins.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in this paragraph (b) shall apply to all cabins, claimants, occupants, and guests. The regulations
in this paragraph (b) do not apply to temporary facilities: any structure or man-made improvement which can readily
be completely dismantled and removed from the site when the period of authorized use is terminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A special use permit is required to construct, use and/or occupy a cabin on Fish and Wildlife Service lands within
the refuge. The permit may also authorize the use of related structures and other necessary appurtenances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) After adequate public notice has been given, unclaimed cabins become the property of the Federal Government.
Adequate public notice shall include: Posting notices of trespass on unclaimed cabins; publication of notices of
trespass in Anchorage and Fairbanks newspapers and in at least one local newspaper if available; and posting notices
of trespass at appropriate community post offices. A Government-owned cabin may be used for refuge administration,
used for emergency purposes by the public, permitted to another applicant, designated a public use cabin, or destroyed.
Disposal of excess cabins and structures will be according to regulations pursuant to Title 41, Chapter 114 of the
Code of Federal Regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Willful noncompliance with the conditions and stipulations of a special use permit shall be considered grounds
to invoke the administrative process leading to notice and hearing, and possible revocation of the permit. The refuge
manager will attempt to resolve problems of noncompliance with the permittee as soon as possible after the situation
becomes known. If this effort fails, the refuge manager shall provide written notice to the permittee within 30 days
of that date, informing the permittee of noncompliance, giving specific instructions for compliance and providing
appropriate time for the permittee to comply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) No special use permit will be issued for the construction of a cabin for private recreational use or for the private
recreational use of an existing cabin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Guests are allowed to occupy a cabin only during the activity period identified on the special use permit. Guests
occupying a cabin during the absence of the permittee shall obtain a letter of authorization from the permittee. The
guest must have a copy of the letter in his/her possession. In commercial cabins, the permittee or another person listed
on the permit must be present when the cabin is occupied by guests or clients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A person whose permit application (new or renewal) for a cabin has been denied or whose cabin permit has been revoked
by the refuge manager may appeal to the Regional Director as described in &sect;36.41(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Existing cabins.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (c) shall apply to all existing cabins,
claimants, occupants, and guests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Where a valid cabin permit or lease was in effect on December 2, 1980, or at the time the land was subsequently added
to the refuge, the refuge manager shall provide for the continuation of the permit or lease under the same conditions.
The new permit shall be nontransferable and renewable every five years unless the continuation would directly threaten
or significantly impair the purposes for which the refuge was established. The cabin and related structures are the
personal property of the claimant and can be removed by him/her upon non-renewal or revocation. The owner of a cabin
may sell his/her interest in the cabin to another person; however, the new owner does not automatically qualify for
a permit and must apply for a new one.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To obtain a special use permit for a cabin that was not under permit or lease before December 2, 1980, or at the time
the land was subsequently added to the refuge, a claimant should submit to the refuge manager an application that includes
the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Reasonable proof of possessory interest or right to occupy the cabin as shown by affidavit, bill of sale, or other
document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Date of construction or acquisition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A sketch or photograph that accurately depicts the cabin and related structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The dimensions of the cabin and related structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) A U.S. Geological Survey topographic map that shows the geographic location of the cabin and related structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The claimant's agreement to vacate and remove all personal property from the cabin and related structures within
one year from receipt of a non-renewal or revocation notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) The claimant's acknowledgment that he/she has no legal interest in the real property on which the cabin and related
structures are located.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) A list of family members residing with the claimant in the cabin being applied for. It need only include those
immediate family members who may be eligible to renew a permit for continued use and occupancy upon the original claimant's
death (this is not applicable to cabins used for commercial purposes).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Applications for permits for existing cabins, which are not currently under valid permits, will only be accepted
for a period of one year following the effective date of these regulations. However, cabins that were legally located
on lands that subsequently become refuge will also be considered ``existing'' cabins. The owners will have two years
following the date the lands become refuge to apply for a permit. Following those dates, all applications for cabins
will be for ``new'' cabins only, no matter when the cabin was built or first used. If ownership is not established within
three years after the land becomes refuge, the cabin may be considered abandoned, and it will become Federal property
in accordance with Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The occupancy of a noncommercial cabin is limited to the permittee and his/her family, bona fide partners, and
guests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Major modification or rehabilitation of an existing cabin must be approved by the refuge manager before construction
begins. The modifications will be done by the permittee or designated agent and will remain the property of the permittee.
Major additions (e.g., larger than the original cabin) may fall under the ownership provisions for new cabins. Although
cabins destroyed by accidents, vandalism or natural causes may be reconstructed, they must be approved by the refuge
manager before construction and must meet the construction guidelines for new cabins, even though remaining the
property of the claimant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
New cabins.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (d) shall apply to all new cabins, claimants,
occupants, and guests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A nontransferable, five year special use permit shall only be issued upon a determination that the proposed construction,
use and maintenance of the cabin is compatible with refuge purposes and that the cabin use is either directly related
to refuge administration or is needed for continuation of an ongoing activity or use otherwise allowed within the
refuge where the applicant lacks a reasonable off-refuge site. In addition, these activities must have historically
been supported by the construction and use of cabins in the geographic area. In general, new cabin permits will be given
only to local residents to pursue a legitimate subsistence activity. In determining whether to permit the construction,
use, and occupancy of cabins or other structures, the refuge manager shall be guided by factors such as other public
uses, public health and safety, environmental and resource protection, research activities, protection of historic
or scientific values, subsistence uses, endangered or threatened species conservation and other management considerations
necessary to ensure that the activities authorized pursuant to a permit are compatible with the purposes for which
the refuge was established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To obtain a special use permit for a new cabin, an applicant should submit to the refuge manager an application that
includes the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A sketch that accurately depicts the proposed cabin and related structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The dimensions of the proposed cabin and related structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A U.S. Geological Survey topographic map that shows the geographic location of the proposed cabin and related
structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The applicant's agreement to vacate and remove all personal property from the cabin and related structures within
one year from receipt of a non-renewal or revocation notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The applicant's acknowledgment that he/she has no legal interest in the cabin and related structures or in the
real property on which the cabin and related structures are located.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) A list of family members residing with the applicant in the cabin being applied for. It need only include those
immediate family members who may be eligible to renew a permit for continued use and occupancy upon the original claimant's
death.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The permitting instrument shall be a nontransferable renewable five year special use permit. It shall be renewed
every five years (upon request) until the death of the original claimant's last immediate family member unless the
special use permit has been revoked or the cabin has been abandoned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) No new cabins will be constructed in designated wilderness areas unless they are built specifically for the administration
of the area, for public safety, or for trapping where trapping has been a traditional and customary use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) New trapping cabins in wilderness will be available for public use to ensure public health and safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The occupancy of a noncommercial cabin is limited to the permittee, and his/her family, bona fide partners, and
guests.

In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (e) shall apply to all commercial cabins,
permittees, clients, guests, and occupants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A special use permit is required for all cabins used for commercial purposes. Refuge managers may also issue special
use permits that authorize additional commercial use of an existing cabin used for guiding, etc. The use of a new cabin
shall be limited to the type of use specified in the original permit. The refuge manager may permit the use of an existing
cabin on non-wilderness refuge lands for the exercise of valid commercial fishing rights. Such a permit may be denied
if, after conducting a public hearing in the affected locality, it is found that the use is inconsistent with refuge
purposes and is a significant expansion of commercial fishing activities within the unit beyond 1979 levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the commercial fishing or guiding rights associated with a permittee's existing cabin are acquired by a new
party, the privilege of using the cabin cannot be sold and the new party does not necessarily qualify for a cabin permit.
He/she must apply for a permit and meet the criteria described in this paragraph (e) before issuance of a special use
permit by the refuge manager. He/she may not occupy the cabin before issuance of a permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No new commercial cabins will be permitted in wilderness areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Commercial cabins may be occupied only by persons legitimately involved in the commercial enterprise, assistants,
employees, their families, guests and clients and only during the time that the authorized activity is occurring.
The names of those individuals, excluding guests and clients, will be listed on the permit. The permittee or another
individual listed on the permit must be present when the cabin is occupied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Special use permits for commercial cabins may be renewed annually in conjunction with the special use permit renewal
for the commercial activity itself. The cabin permit may be issued for periods of up to five years and is a separate permit
from one issued for the commercial activity.

Administrative and government-owned public use cabins. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to paragraph (a) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (f) apply to all administrative and
government-owned cabins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The refuge manager can designate those cabins not under permit as administrative cabins to be used for official
government business. Administrative cabins may be used by the public during life-threatening emergencies. On a
case-by-case basis, they may also be designated as public use cabins when not needed for government purposes. In such
cases, the refuge manager must inform the public and post dates or seasons when the cabins are available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The refuge manager may designate government-owned cabins as public use cabins. They are only intended for short-term
public recreational use and occupancy. The refuge manager may develop an allocation system for managing public use
cabins for short-term recreational use. No existing public use cabins shall be removed or new public use cabins constructed
within wilderness areas designated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 or subsequently
designated wilderness areas until the Secretary of the Interior notifies the House Committee on Interior and Insular
Affairs and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule sets forth the requirements and procedures for awarding Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
funds to Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Following issuance of a proposed rule on June 21, 1991, the Department issued an interim rule on April 7, 1992, regarding
the criteria for awarding CDBG funding to Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages. The Department has decided to
issue another interim rule to address the comments received on the April 7, 1992 interim rule and to allow the public
to see how the rule works in conjunction with the latest Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA). This interim rule will
enable Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages to meet with representatives of the HUD Office of Native American
Programs (ONAP) field offices to make suggestions for modification of the regulation before it is issued in final
form.

The authority for the CDBG program for Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages was previously with the Office of
Community Planning and Development; therefore, all previous issuances refer to it under 24 CFR part 571. However,
that authority was transferred recently to the Office of Public and Indian Housing. Therefore, this interim rule
is placed in 24 CFR part 953, and part 571 is removed.

Section 105 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;235) (``Reform
Act''), as amended by the National Affordable Housing Act (``NAHA''), amended Title I of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1974 (``1974 Act''), by transferring the authority for making grants to Indian Tribes from the
section 107 discretionary fund to the allocation and distribution of funds provisions of Section 106 of the 1974 Act.
Under section 106, as so amended, one percent of the title I appropriation, excluding the amounts appropriated for
use under section 107, is allocated for grants to Indian Tribes. The allocated amount is to be distributed to Indian
Tribes/Villages on a competitive basis in accordance with selection criteria ``contained in a regulation promulgated
by the Secretary after notice and public comment.'' The Department issued the proposed rule on June 21, 1991, at 56
FR 28666, to comply with the requirement for publication for comment. The Department issued an interim rule, April
7, 1992, at 57 FR 11832, to give the public an additional opportunity to comment on the interim rule after it has been
in effect for one round of competition. This revised interim rule is issued to address the comments and will allow the
public to see how the interim rule works in conjunction with the latest NOFA.

Section 953.602 describes applicable relocation and real property acquisition policies, including those implementing
the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA). Under the government-wide
URA rule at 49 CFR Part 24, any person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organizations, or farm) displaced
on or after April 2, 1989 as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation or demolition for a project assisted under
this part is entitled to URA relocation assistance. The acquisition of real property for a project assisted under
this part is also subject to the URA. The URA policies are described in HUD Handbook 1378, Tenant Assistance, Relocation
and Real Property Acquisition.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received 18 individual comments from 9 sources on the interim
rule published on April 7, 1992. HUD received 6 letters from tribes, and 3 from regional and private organizations.
General comments are discussed below and are followed by specific comments. The specific comments and the Department's
responses are discussed under ``Specific Comments,'' according to the section where they appear in the interim regulation.

General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Numerous comments were received requesting more tribal involvement in the development of the final rule and NOFA.
Also questioned was the need for a national NOFA since the program had operated with a regional competition in the past.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The passage of two statutes, NAHA and the Reform Act, created the need for a national NOFA and revised rule. These statutes
changed the Indian Community Development Block (ICDBG) program selection process. The NAHA required the Secretary
of HUD to promulgate a regulation containing selection criteria used to award funds in competitive programs. The
Reform Act restricts the disclosure of information about HUD programs and discretionary funds. The current interim
ICDBG rule contained changes reflecting the NAHA and Reform Act requirements. As a result of the written comments
received and the consultation sessions held relative to this interim rule, a second interim rule is being published
to continue the process of refining and developing a final rule. HUD is committed to involving the public in this process
to the extent practicable. In order to publish a fair and coherent NOFA, HUD Headquarters consulted extensively with
HUD ONAP field offices throughout the NOFA's development. Since the ONAP field offices are in frequent contact with
the tribes/villages within their jurisdiction, they were able to provide Headquarters with information on how various
NOFA provisions would be received by ICDBG applicants. Following the publication of the NOFA and regulation and after
the selection process has been completed, HUD field staff will hold public meetings to get suggestions on how to improve
the NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the Department's ability to more readily respond to the consultation process, changes to the rating
criteria have been made in this Interim Rule. Sections 953.303, 953.304, and 953.305 have been modified to permit
a wider range of changes to the rating criteria in the NOFA without changing the regulation. The separate rating criteria
has been eliminated for Public Services activities at &sect;953.306. Eligible Public Service activities must still
meet the submission criteria set out in this part.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment was received concerning the requirement that the applicant must, when reporting income levels to HUD,
include and identify the distribution of tribal or village income to families, households or individuals in the definition
of low and moderate income beneficiary. The commenter pointed out the existence of a Federal statute that might preclude
the use of portions of such payments from being considered income when determining eligibility for federal or federally
assisted programs.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is recognized that such exclusions may exist and the statutory mandates will be followed where appropriate. Their
existence would not necessarily indicate the need for additional language identifying the exclusions. These claimed
exclusions would be identified by the applicant when reporting income to HUD when complying with this section of the
interim rule.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment was received noting that Indians residing in urban areas and metropolitan cities and not on reservations
do not receive adequate service or funding from IHS and no service from BIA. The commenter suggested that if HUD recognized
these groups it would be beneficial in gaining acceptance with other agencies such as IHS and BIA.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department does not have legislative authority to provide Federal recognition to Indian Tribes or Alaskan Native
Villages, but deals with those tribes and villages recognized by the Treasury Department and the Bureau of Indian
Affairs as stipulated in this section. The Indian groups residing in urban areas and metropolitan cities and not on
reservations can receive, to the extent such persons are otherwise eligible as low income persons, benefits under
the regular CDBG programs serving the area where they reside.

The commenter also indicated the desire to establish an entitlement program for the Indians. This proposal has been
considered but cannot be adopted without amendments to existing legislation. For these reasons there are no changes
proposed in this section of the interim rule.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters requested that HUD give the field offices latitude in providing more technical assistance on responding
to the NOFA and the submission requirements than presently permitted. Several felt that the tribes/villages are
penalized for not having the sophistication needed to prepare successful applications. One commenter felt that
the lack of technical assistance resulted in some tribes/villages not submitting applications for activities they
felt were most appropriate to address their needs because of the uncertainty of their eligibility or rating. The majority
of the commenters felt that expanded technical assistance was necessary for the tribes/villages to successfully
compete in the program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The technical assistance provisions of the Reform Act limit the direct assistance that may be provided by the Department.
New regulations providing in-depth guidance have been issued by the Department and are expected to more clearly define
the technical assistance role of the Field staff. Technical Assistance during the application process will be provided
to the greatest extent allowed by the Reform Act.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter felt that the method of setting grant ceilings was not equitable because the established limits in their

Paragraph (b)(1) of this section gives the Assistant Secretary final authority to determine grant ceilings for each
field office. Field offices recommend the ceilings for their jurisdiction. The reason for this process is to ensure
that grant ceilings are appropriate on a national level. The Department has determined that the present procedure
for establishing grant ceilings is the most appropriate method of establishing these limits and proposes no changes
to this section.

HUD will use Census data. HUD recognizes that Census data on Indian and Alaskan native populations may be incomplete
or inaccurate. However, these are the only data that are consistently available, and they are reasonably representative
when aggregated by region. HUD encourages tribes and villages to use their own survey or other locally collected data
in their project applications, after consulting with the ONAP on appropriate data collection methods, if they believe
these to be more reliable.

One commenter suggested that in cases where recaptured funds became available and are offered to a standby applicant
to fund a previously rated and ranked activity, the applicant should be funded on the new cost estimate and not the amount
applied for initially. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In all cases where recaptured funds are reallocated to fund a standby application, the Department must insure the
criteria contained in the governing NOFA are met. If the amounts available are not sufficient to fund the application
as proposed, the next highest ranked application would be considered for funding.

This recommendation was considered but not included in the revisions to the interim rule. The current application
process is intended to promote a competition where all applicants have an equal chance for funding and not one that
depends upon an applicant's ability to produce large numbers of projects that could be included in their application.
The present application process leaves the decisions on the type of project to be submitted with the applicant and
does not pass it on to HUD.

The regulation gives applicants

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
at least 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
30 days to submit their applications to the field office. This minimum level was established so that it is clear that
under any circumstance an applicant would have at least this amount of time to prepare an application. The NOFA will
establish the time in which the applicants have to prepare and submit their applications. The application submission
deadline will continue to be established by Headquarters, since the NOFA is issued on a national basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to streamline this regulation, portions of &sect;953.300, Application requirements, will be moved

This process allows applicants to submit only that information requested by the field office to help clarify the application.
HUD's regulations at 24 CFR 4.105(b)(3) allow authorized employees, during the selection process, to contact applicants
to seek clarification of the terms of an applicant's submission. HUD policy requires each NOFA to include a cure period
for technical deficiencies of at least 14 calendar days. Any deficiency that can be cured (e.g., the submission of
a missing certification) cannot affect the rating of the application in either a positive or negative way and should
by its nature be readily correctable within the present 14 day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Portions of &sect;953.301, Screening and review of applications, have been moved from this Interim Rule and will

One commenter requested a reconsideration of the portions of this section that relate to the definition of ``neediest
segment of the population'' in the rating factors for community buildings. This rating factor required that more
than 80% of the beneficiaries be very low income to receive the maximum points. Fifty-one to 79.9 percent of the beneficiaries
must be very low income to receive moderate points.

 While this specific language has been removed from the regulation, it in no way diminishes HUD commitment to empower

Section 953.307(b)(2) of the current regulation gives successful applicants at least 30 days to provide supporting
documentation at the request of the field office, prior to execution of the grant agreement. One commenter suggested
expanding the 30-day period because of the difficulty of preparing and submitting such information to make the application
more competitive within the 30-day time period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has decided to issue another interim rule to address the comments received on the April 7, 1992 interim

is issued in final form.

Program objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary objective of the Indian CDBG (ICDBG) Program and of the community development program of each grantee
covered under this Act is the development of viable Indian and Alaskan native communities, including decent housing,
a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities, principally for persons of low- and moderate-income.
The Federal assistance provided in this part is not to be used to reduce substantially the amount of local financial
support for community development activities below the level of such support prior to the availability of this assistance.

Nature of program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ICDBG Program is competitive in nature. Therefore, selection of eligible applicants for funds will reflect consideration
of the relative adequacy of applications in addressing locally determined need. Applicants for funding must have
the administrative capacity to undertake the community development activities proposed, including the systems
of internal control necessary to administer these activities effectively without fraud, waste, or mismanagement.

Applicability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD has determined that grants under this part are subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education
Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450e(b)), which requires that, to the greatest extent feasible:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Preference and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Preference in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned
economic enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definitions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises include both of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any economic enterprise as defined in section 3(e) of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93&hyph;262); that
is, ``any Indian-owned commercial, industrial, or business activity established or organized for the purpose of
profit provided that such Indian ownership and control shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise'';
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any ``Tribal organizations'' as defined in section 4(c) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance
Act (Pub. L. 93&hyph;638); that is, ``the recognized governing body of any Indian Tribe; any legally established
organization of Indians which is controlled, sanctioned or chartered by such governing body or which is democratically
elected by the adult members of the Indian community to be served by such organizations and which includes the maximum
participation of Indians in all phases of its activities.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Preference in administration of grant. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To the greatest extent feasible, preference and opportunities for training and employment in connection with the
administration of grants awarded under this part shall be given to Indians and Alaskan natives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Preference in contracting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To the greatest extent feasible, grantees shall give preference in the award of contracts for projects funded under
this part to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Each grantee shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Advertise for bids or proposals limited to qualified Indian organizations and Indian-owned enterprises; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Use a two-stage preference procedure, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Stage 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Invite or otherwise solicit Indian-owned economic enterprises to submit a statement of intent to respond to a bid
announcement limited to Indian-owned firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Stage 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals
limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Develop, subject to HUD field office one-time approval, the grantee's own method of providing preference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the grantee selects a method of providing preference that results in fewer than two responsible qualified organizations
or enterprises submitting a statement of intent, a bid or a proposal to perform the contract at a reasonable cost, then
the grantee shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Re-bid the contract, using any of the methods described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Re-bid the contract without limiting the advertisement for bids or proposals to Indian organizations and Indian-owned
economic enterprises; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If one approvable bid is received, request field office review and approval of the proposed contract and related
procurement documents, in accordance with 24 CFR 85.36, in order to award the contract to the single bidder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Procurements that are within the dollar limitations established for small purchases under 24 CFR 85.36 need not
follow the formal bid procedures of paragraph (d) of this section, since these procurements are governed by the small
purchase procedures of 24 CFR 85.36. However, a grantee's small purchase procurement shall, to the greatest extent
feasible, provide Indian preference in the award of contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) All preferences shall be publicly announced in the advertisement and bidding solicitation and the bidding documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A grantee, at its discretion, may require information of prospective contractors seeking to qualify as Indian
organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises; however, this information need not be submitted to HUD. Grantees
may require prospective contractors to include the following information prior to submitting a bid or proposal,
or at the time of submission:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Evidence showing fully the extent of Indian ownership, control, and interest;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Evidence of structure, management and financing affecting the Indian character of the enterprise, including
major subcontracts and purchase agreements; materials or equipment supply arrangements; and management salary
or profit-sharing arrangements; and evidence showing the effect of these on the extent of Indian ownership and interest;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Evidence sufficient to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the grantee that the prospective contractor has
the technical, administrative, and financial capability to perform contract work of the size and type involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The grantee shall incorporate the following clause (referred to as the Section 7(b) clause) in each contract awarded
in connection with a project funded under this part:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The work to be performed under this contract is on a project subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination
and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450e(b)) (Indian Act). Section 7(b) requires that to the greatest extent
feasible:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Preferences in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned
economic enterprises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The parties to this contract shall comply with the provisions of Section 7(b) of the Indian Act.

preference requirements shall be consistent with the objectives of the Section 7(b) clause of the Indian Act and shall
not result in a significantly higher cost or greater risk of non-performance or longer period of performance. The
additional Indian preference requirements permitted by this part do not include the imposition of geographic preferences

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Program income received before grant closeout may be retained by the recipient if the income is treated as additional
CDBG funds subject to all applicable requirements governing the use of CDBG funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the recipient chooses to retain program income, that income shall affect withdrawals of grant funds from the
U.S. Treasury as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Program income in the form of repayments to, or interest earned on, a revolving fund shall be substantially disbursed
from the fund before additional cash withdrawals are made from the U.S. Treasury for the same activity. (This rule
does not prevent a lump sum disbursement to finance the rehabilitation of privately owned properties as provided
for in &sect;570.513 of this title.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Substantially all other program income shall be disbursed for eligible activities before additional cash withdrawals
are made from the U.S. Treasury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Program income on hand at the time of closeout shall continue to be subject to the eligibility requirements in subpart
C of this part and all other applicable provisions of this part until it is expended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Unless otherwise provided in any grant closeout agreement, and subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(5)
of this section, income received after closeout shall not be governed by the provisions of this part, except that,
if at the time of closeout the recipient has another ongoing CDBG grant received directly from HUD, funds received
after closeout shall be treated as program income of the ongoing grant program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If the recipient does not have another ongoing grant received directly from HUD at the time of closeout, income
received after closeout from the disposition of real property or from loans outstanding at the time of closeout shall
not be governed by the provisions of this part, except that such income shall be used for activities that meet one of
the national objectives in 24 CFR 570.208 and the eligibility requirements described in section 105 of the Act.

A displaced person (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels
described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition
Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA)(42 U.S.C. 4601&hyph;4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.

Under section 105(a)(11) of the Act, the grantee may provide relocation payments and other relocation assistance
to persons displaced by a project that is not subject to paragraph (c) of this section. The grantee may also provide
relocation assistance to persons receiving assistance under paragraph (c) of this section at levels in excess of
those required. For assistance that is not required by State or tribal law, the grantee shall adopt a written policy
available to the public that describes the relocation assistance that it has elected to furnish and provides for equal

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Acquisition of real property. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The acquisition of real property for an assisted activity is subject to 49 CFR part 24, subpart B. Whenever the grantee
does not have the authority to acquire the real property through condemnation, it shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Before discussing the purchase price, inform the owner: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Of the amount it believes to be the fair market value of the property. Such amount shall be based upon one or more appraisals
prepared by a qualified appraiser. However, this provision does not prevent the grantee from accepting a donation
or purchasing the real property at less than its fair market value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) That it will be unable to acquire the property if negotiations fail to result in an amicable agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Request HUD approval of the proposed acquisition price before executing a firm commitment to purchase the property.
The grantee shall include with its request a copy of the appraisal(s) and, when applicable, a justification for any
proposed acquisition payment that exceeds the fair market value of the property. HUD will promptly review the proposal
and inform the grantee of it's approval or disapproval.

A person who disagrees with the grantee's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a ``displaced
person,'' or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that
determination with the grantee. A person who is dissatisfied with the grantee's determination on his or her appeal
may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Field Office.

of this section, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provide assurance of compliance as required by 49 CFR part 24). The grantee shall ensure such compliance notwithstanding
any third party's contractual obligation to the grantee to comply with these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent
as other project costs. However, such assistance may also be paid for with funds available to the grantee from any other
source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The grantee shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Displaced person. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) For purposes of this section, the term ``displaced person'' means any person (family, individual, business,
nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property,
permanently, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for a project assisted under this
part. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted project, including any permanent move from real
property that is made: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) After notice by the grantee or property owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs on or after
the date of the submission of an application for financial assistance by the grantee to HUD that is later approved for
the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Before the date of the submission of the application requesting assistance, if either HUD or the grantee determines
that the displacement directly resulted from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the following three situations occurs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The tenant moves after execution of the agreement between the grantee and HUD and the move occurs before the tenant
is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary
dwelling in the same building/complex upon completion of the project under reasonable terms and conditions. Such
reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed
the greater of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) the tenant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs before the agreement; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) 30 percent of gross household income; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return to the building/complex, and either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) the tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary
relocation or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The tenant is required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex but is not offered reimbursement
for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other conditions of the move are
not reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced
person'' (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application for financial assistance to HUD, and,
before signing a lease or commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on
the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the
person would not qualify as a ``displaced person'' or for any assistance provided under this section as a result of
the project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The person is not displaced, as defined under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The grantee determines the person is not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition
for an assisted project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A grantee may ask HUD, at any time, to determine whether a specific displacement is or would be covered under this

(3) Developing and publishing or posting a community development statement in such a manner as to afford affected
residents an opportunity to examine its contents and to submit comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Affording residents an opportunity to review and comment on the applicant's performance under any active community
development block grant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) made the modified application available to residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) No part of the requirement under paragraph (a) of this section shall be construed to restrict the responsibility

the citizen participation requirements of this section do not include concurrence by any person or group in making
final determinations on the contents of the application.

 Except for the use of ICDBG funds to pay salaries and other related administrative or personnel costs, the general
rule is that no persons described in paragraph (c) of this section who exercise or have exercised any functions or responsibilities
with respect to ICDBG activities assisted under this part or who are in a position to participate in a decision-making
process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain a personal or financial interest or

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Factors to be considered for exceptions:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the recipient has satisfactorily met the requirements
of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, HUD shall consider the cumulative effect of the following factors, where applicable:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or essential expert knowledge to the program or
project which would otherwise not be available; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or from the decision-making
process, with reference to the specific assisted activity in question; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph
(b) of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Whether undue hardship will result, either to the recipient or to the person affected, when weighed against the
public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Any other relevant considerations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Circumstances under which the conflict prohibition does not apply.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) In instances where a person who might otherwise be deemed to be included under the conflict prohibition is a member

as are being made available or provided to the group or class, the prohibition does not apply, except that if, by not
applying the prohibition against conflict of interest, a violation of Tribal or State laws on conflict of interest
would result, the prohibition does apply. However, if the assistance to be provided is housing rehabilitation (or
repair) or new housing, a public disclosure of the nature of the assistance to be provided and the specific basis for
the selection of the proposed beneficiaries must be made prior to the submission of an application to HUD. Evidence
of this disclosure must be provided as a component of the application.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The action taken by HUD will be designed, first, to prevent the continuance of the deficiency; second, to mitigate
any adverse effects or consequences of the deficiency; and third, to prevent a recurrence of the same or similar deficiencies.
The following actions may be taken singly or in combination, as appropriate for the circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Request the recipient to submit progress schedules for completing approved activities or for complying with
the requirements of this part; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Issue a letter of warning advising the recipient of the deficiency (including environmental review deficiencies
and housing assistance deficiencies), describing the corrective actions to be taken, establishing a date for corrective
actions, and putting the recipient on notice that more serious actions will be taken if the deficiency is not corrected
or is repeated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Advise the recipient that a certification of compliance will no longer be acceptable and that additional information
or assurances will be required; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Advise the recipient to suspend, discontinue, or not incur costs for the affected activity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Advise the recipient to reprogram funds from affected activities to other eligible activities, provided that
such action shall not be taken in connection with any substantial violation of Part 58 and provided that such reprogramming
is subjected to the environmental review procedures of Part 58 of this title; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Advise the recipient to reimburse the recipient's program account or line of credit in any amount improperly expended;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Change the method of payment from a line of credit basis to a reimbursement basis; and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Suspend the line of credit until corrective actions are taken.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A reduction or withdrawal of a grant under paragraph (b) of this section will not be made until at least one of the corrective
or remedial actions specified in &sect;953.702(b) has been taken and only then if the recipient has not made an appropriate
and timely response. Before making such a grant reduction or withdrawal, the recipient also shall be notified and
given an opportunity within a prescribed time for an informal consultation regarding the proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When the field office determines, on the basis of a review of the grant recipient's performance, that the objectives
set forth in &sect;953.701(a)(2) or (3) have not been met, the field office may reduce or withdraw the grant, except
that funds already expended on eligible approved activities shall not be recaptured.

Secretarial actions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the Secretary finds a recipient has failed to comply with any provision of this part even after corrective actions
authorized under &sect;953.702 have been applied, the following actions may be taken provided that reasonable notice
and opportunity for hearing is made to the recipient. (The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.), where
applicable, shall be a guide in any situation involving adjudications where the Secretary desires to take actions
requiring reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Terminate the grant to the recipient; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reduce the grant to the recipient by an amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equal to the amount which was not expended in accordance with this part; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Limit the availability of funds to projects or activities not affected by such failure to comply; provided, however,
that the Secretary may on due notice revoke the recipient's line of credit in whole or in part at any time if the Secretary
determines that such action is necessary to preclude the further expenditure of funds for activities affected by
such failure to comply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If there is reason to believe that a recipient has failed to comply substantially with any provision of the Act, the
Secretary may refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States with a recommendation that an appropriate
civil action be instituted. Upon such a referral, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in any United States
district court having venue thereof for such relief as may be appropriate, including an action to recover the amount
of the assistance furnished under this part which was not expended in accordance with this part or for mandatory or
injunctive relief.
