SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to amend the General Specifications for Dairy Plants Approved for USDA Inspection and Grading
Service (General Specifications). The proposed changes would revise the requirements for anhydrous milkfat to
allow butter to be used as an ingredient and would revise the requirements for butteroil to allow the addition of safe
and suitable antioxidants. The proposal to allow the use of butter was initiated at the request of the American Butter
Institute.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule also has been reviewed in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, has determined that this proposed rule, if promulgated, would
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because participation in the USDA-approved
plant program is voluntary and the amendments would not increase the costs to those utilizing the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Specifications, established in 1975, do not provide for butter to be used in making anhydrous milkfat
in USDA-approved dairy plants. This is inconsistent with international standards that allow butter to be used in
anhydrous milkfat. The General Specifications also do not provide for the addition of antioxidants to butteroil,
which also is permitted in international standards. These restrictions have placed the domestic manufacturer at
a disadvantage when competing in the world market.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To permit domestic manufacturers of anhydrous milkfat and butteroil to compete on equal terms with manufacturers
from other exporting countries, and to amend the General Specifications to more closely align U.S. requirements
with international standards, USDA is proposing changes to Part 58, subpart B, of the grading and inspection regulations
concerning dairy products, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Amend Ingredient Requirements to Permit Butter To Be Used as an Ingredient in Anhydrous Milkfat
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Specifications were established in 1975 and permit only cream to be used as an ingredient in anhydrous
milkfat. The International Dairy Federation and the Codex Alimentarius Commission have both developed internationally
recognized standards that allow the use of butter in making anhydrous milkfat. Revision of the General Specifications
is being proposed to align USDA requirements with internationally recognized standards and allow butter as an ingredient
in anhydrous milkfat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allow the Addition of Antioxidants to Butteroil
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Specifications do not provide for the addition of antioxidants to butteroil. International dairy standards
permit the addition of antioxidants to assist in preserving the flavor characteristics of this product. Revision
of the General Specifications is being proposed to align USDA requirements with international standards and to allow
the addition of antioxidants to butteroil, provided the antioxidant used is permitted by standards developed by
the Codex Alimentarius Commission and authorized for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Standards
developed by the Commission may be found in the ``Standard A&hyph;2 for Milkfat Products.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Specifications allow a maximum moisture content of 0.15 percent in anhydrous milkfat. International
standards developed by the International Dairy Federation and the Codex Alimentarius Commission allow a maximum
moisture content of 0.1 percent. Revision of the General Specifications is being proposed to align USDA requirements
with international standards by reducing the maximum allowable moisture content to 0.1 percent.

Provide for the Pasteurization of Oil (Highly Concentrated Milkfat) in the Manufacture of Anhydrous Milkfat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pasteurization of dairy products ensures the destruction of pathogenic organisms. The General Specifications
require cream to be pasteurized in the production of anhydrous milkfat. In some segments of the dairy industry, this
pasteurization step occurs when the milkfat in the cream has been concentrated to a level where it is considered to
be ``oil'' rather than cream. Changes in the General Specifications are being proposed to provide for this industry
practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Restrict the Amount of Other Butter Constituents in Anhydrous Milkfat When Butter is used as an Ingredient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When butter is used in anhydrous milkfat, the majority of the non-milkfat constituents normally found in butter are
removed during the manufacture of the product. The non-milkfat constituents which are removed include protein,
ash, and salt. Changes are being proposed to restrict the amount of these non-milkfat constituents that would be permitted
to remain in anhydrous milkfat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anhydrous milkfat specifications established by USDA are voluntary specifications that are developed to facilitate
the orderly marketing process. Dairy plants are free to choose whether or not to use the specifications. When manufactured
or processed dairy products are graded or inspected, the USDA regulations governing the grading or inspection of
dairy products are used.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule invites comments on revising the administrative rules and regulations in effect under the Texas
citrus marketing order. The revision would eliminate the provision which exempts fruit handled for home use from
the order's grade, size, pack, container, inspection and assessment requirements. This proposed rule would help
prevent unauthorized shipments of uninspected citrus from being shipped out of the production area. Individuals
would continue to be able to handle up to 400 pounds of citrus per day exempt from order requirements which should be
sufficient for fruit purchased for home use.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 906 [7 CFR Part 906] regulating the handling of
oranges and grapefruit grown in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas, hereinafter referred to as the order. The agreement
and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674],
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This proposed rule is not
intended to have retroactive effect. This proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or
policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses would not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 15 handlers of oranges and grapefruit regulated under the marketing order each season and
approximately 750 orange and grapefruit producers in south Texas. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR &sect;121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000,
and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority
of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 906.40 of the order authorizes the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container requirements
for fresh shipments of Texas oranges and grapefruit. Whenever such requirements are in effect, oranges and grapefruit
are required to be inspected and certified as meeting applicable standards in accordance with &sect;906.45 of the
order. The program is financed through handler assessments, established pursuant to &sect;906.34. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The order provides, in &sect;906.42, that regulations issued under &sect;&sect;906.34, 906.40, and 906.45 may
be modified, suspended or terminated to facilitate the handling of citrus fruit for certain purposes. Under this
authority, &sect;906.120 of the order's rules and regulations provides that oranges and grapefruit may be handled
for relief, charity or home use exempt from order requirements. Handlers desiring to utilize this exemption are required
to apply to the Texas Valley Citrus Committee (committee), the agency established to administer the order locally.
In making an application, the handler is required to submit information such as the quantity of fruit to be handled
under the exemption and its intended destination. Based on the information provided, the committee determines whether
to approve the application and issue the handler a certificate of privilege. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee met on May 10, 1994, and unanimously recommended revising paragraph (c)(1) of &sect;906.120 by deleting
``home use'' from the provision which allows fruit to be handled exempt from regulation. Current regulations allow
for an unlimited amount of fruit to be shipped for home use (not for resale) exempt from all marketing order requirements.
The committee recommended this amendment to reduce the potential for abuse of the home use exemption. The committee
has had difficulty in verifing the final disposition of exempted fruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee expressed concern that bulk loads of uninspected fruit may enter fresh, commercial markets and prove
detrimental to producer returns if the exemption is not removed. Section 906.120(c)(1) is proposed to be amended
by deleting the phrase ``home use''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other exemptions from order requirements would remain unchanged. Under paragraph (a) of &sect;906.120, individuals
would continue to be able to handle up to 400 pounds of citrus per day exempt from order requirements. The committee
believes that this minimum quantity exemption is sufficient to cover fruit purchased for home use and not for resale.
Thus, it is not expected that this action would adversely impact those persons who purchase Texas oranges and grapefruit
directly from handlers for their own use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number
0581&hyph;0068 for oranges and grapefruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule would reduce the reporting burden on approximately 6 handlers of oranges and grapefruit who have been completing
the Special Purpose Shipments Form (Application for fundraiser-specialty pack), taking about 5 minutes to complete
each report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit their views and comments on this proposal. All comments timely received
will be considered prior to issuance of any final rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain Aerospatiale Model ATR72 series airplanes. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal would require an inspection to determine the model and orientation of certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flight control rods, and replacement with modified rods, if necessary. This proposal is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prompted by reports of corrosion found on the pitch and rudder trim and rudder travel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limiter fail-safe rods. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems associated with corrosion of the flight control rods, which could compromise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required strength of these items.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR72 series airplanes.
The DGAC advises that corrosion has been detected on the pitch and rudder trim fail-safe rods and the rudder travel
limiter fail-safe rods installed on these airplanes. (This corrosion was found during inspections that were conducted
as a part of a sampling program carried out by the manufacturer.) In some cases, corrosion apparently was caused by
water accumulating in the lower part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rods and freezing; the rods in these cases were installed with their open end oriented upwards (rather than downwards),
which allowed water to accumulate between the internal and external tubes of the rod. Some cracking was associated
with corrosion in these cases. Such corrosion could compromise the required strength of these flight control rods.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aerospatiale has issued the following service bulletins which address the identified problems: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Service Bulletin ATR72&hyph;27&hyph;1033, dated February 23, 1994, describes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for inspecting the elevator trim, rudder trim, and rudder travel limitation rods to determine the orientation
of the open rod end. It also describes procedures for replacing rods having open ends that are oriented upwards with
rods on which the open end of the rod is oriented downwards. A downward-oriented rod end will prevent the accumulation
of water between the internal and external tubes of the rod. The DGAC classified the material contained in this service
bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;001&hyph;018(B), dated January 5, 1994,
in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Service Bulletin ATR72&hyph;27&hyph;1012, Revision 3, dated October 7, 1991, describes procedures for replacing
the currently installed fail-safe control rods with rods that have been modified by the addition of a drain hole in
the non-open end of the rod and the application of a protective treatment. The DGAC has classified this service bulletin
as ``recommended.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Service Bulletin ATR72&hyph;27&hyph;1010, Revision 4, dated February 23, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describes procedures for reversing the installation of the ends of the elevator tab rod and rudder tab rod so that the
open end of the rods is oriented downwards. The DGAC has classified this service bulletin as ``recommended.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Service Bulletin ATR72&hyph;27&hyph;1027, dated July 28, 1993, describes procedures for determining the installation
direction of the fail-safe rod of the rudder travel limitation unit (TLU), and replacing the rod if it is installed
with its open end oriented upwards. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DGAC has classified this service bulletin as ``recommended.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require an inspection to determine the orientation
of the end of the pitch and rudder trim fail-safe rods and the rudder travel limiter fail-safe rods, and replacement
of those rods having downwards-oriented ends. The actions would be required to be accomplished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airplanes on which Aerospatiale Modification 02723 and Modification 03110 have been installed are not affected
by the requirements of this proposed AD. The subject flight control rods on those airplanes have been modified prior
to airplane delivery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 28 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per
work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $9,240,
or $330 per airplane. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any
of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if
this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should replacement of any of the flight control rods be necessary, the number of work hours and the cost of required
parts would vary according to the type of replacement accomplished. In a ``worst case scenario'' (all subject rods
needing replacement), the cost of parts would be approximately $8,200 per airplane. Labor necessary to accomplish
replacement of a rod(s) would vary from 2 work hours to 10 work hours, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it
may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all McDonnell Douglas
Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes. This proposal would require modification
of the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system. This proposal is prompted by an FAA determination that, in the event of a
failure of the number 2 bus tie relay and the subsequent loss of electrical power source of the number 2 engine, an all-engine
flameout event could occur due to fuel starvation during or shortly after a fuel dumping operation. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system due to a failure of the number
2 DC bus electrical relay and the subsequent loss of electrical power source of the number 2 engine.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 1, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;06, amendment 39&hyph;8392, (57 FR 47570, October 19, 1992),
applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 airplanes, Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes, and Model KC&hyph;10A
(military) airplanes. That AD requires revising the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include information to specify
that electrical malfunctions may render the automatic fuel dump termination feature inoperative. That action was
prompted by an incident in which the automatic fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system became inoperative, and fuel was
dumped below the minimum allowable level. Dumping fuel below the minimum allowable level could lead to an all-engine-out

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuance of that AD, an in-depth review has revealed that the fuel dump shutoff system on Model DC&hyph;10 series
airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A airplanes is such that, in the event of a failure of the number 2 bus tie relay and the
subsequent loss of electrical power source of the number 2 engine, an all-engine flameout event could occur due to
fuel starvation during or shortly after fuel dumping operations. This condition, if not corrected, could render
the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system inoperable due to a failure of the number 2 DC bus electrical relay and the subsequent
loss of the number 2 electrical power source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28&hyph;208, dated April 14, 1994, that describes procedures for modification of the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff
system. This modification provides isolation of the engine fuel system, which entails installation of new fuel relays
and, for certain airplanes, relocation of existing relays. Further, this modification also revises the electrical
wiring for the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system to provide redundant electrical power sources, which minimizes
the possibility of system loss in the event of a number 2 engine shutdown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require modification of the fuel crossfeed dump shutoff system. The actions would be
required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. Accomplishment of this
modification will terminate the requirement imposed by paragraph (b) of AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;06 to revise the FAA-approved
AFM, which cautioned that electrical malfunctions may render the automatic fuel dump termination feature inoperative.

On March 23, 1994, the FAA issued AD 94&hyph;07&hyph;07, amendment 39&hyph;8865 (59 FR 15853, April 5, 1994), applicable
to certain Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F airplanes, to require a similar modification to terminate the requirement
imposed by paragraph (a) of AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;06.]

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 425 Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes of the affected
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 221 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed
AD, that it would take approximately 9 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average
labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $1,560 per airplane. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $454,155, or $2,055 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to all Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&hyph;700A series airplanes. This proposal would require installation of two new circuit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breakers in the 6 volt output circuits of the flight deck lighting transformers on electrical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panel `RY,' below the right pilot's seat. This proposal is prompted by a report of smoke in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the flight deck due to a lighting transformer 6 volt output circuit short circuiting to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent smoke or fire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the flight deck due to inadequate circuit protection for 6 volt circuits of the flight deck 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lighting transformer.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and -700A series airplanes. The CAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advises that an incident occurred on a Model HS 125&hyph;700B series airplane when a 6 volt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
output circuit from the flight deck lighting transformer on Panel 'RY' overheated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-circuited to ground. This resulted in a release of acrid smoke in the flight deck. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation revealed that the 6 volt output circuit was not protected by a fuse or circuit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breaker. This condition, if not corrected, could result in smoke and fire in the flight deck 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during flight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and 125&hyph;700A series airplanes are similar in type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design to Model BH/HS 125&hyph;700B series airplanes, the FAA has determined that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop on Model BH/HS 125&hyph;600A and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
125&hyph;700A series airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Raytheon Corporate Jets has issued Service Bulletin SB.24&hyph;310&hyph;3544A&amp;B, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 14, 1994, which describes procedures for installing circuit breakers in the 6 volt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
output circuits of two flight deck lighting transformers. The purpose of the circuit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breakers is to provide circuit protection for the 6-volt output wires and to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overheating and short circuiting. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require installation of two new circuit breakers in the 6 volt output circuits of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flight deck lighting transformers on electrical Panel 'RY.' The actions would be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 202 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts would cost approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $212,100, or $1,050 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directive (AD), applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;8&hyph;70 series airplanes, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently requires replacement of all attachment screws at the exhaust nozzle plug splice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a check of nut plates for running torque and replacement of nut plates, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action would require modification of the engine exhaust plug assemblies; when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished, this modification would terminate the need for the currently required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement and check. This proposal is prompted by reports of loose or missing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attachments at the splice joint of the engine forward and aft exhaust plugs, and loss of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rear exhaust plug following an engine bird strike. The actions specified by the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD are intended to prevent reduced integrity of the engine exhaust plug installation, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may lead to separation of exhaust plugs from the airplane, and create a hazard to persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and property on the ground.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 17, 1983, the FAA issued AD 83&hyph;02&hyph;05, amendment 39&hyph;4544 (48 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5539, February 7, 1983), applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;8&hyph;70 series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes, to require replacement of all attachment screws at the exhaust nozzle plug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splice. That AD also requires a check of nut plates for running torque and replacement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nut plates not meeting the minimum run down torque of five inch-pounds. That action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was prompted by reports of loose or missing attachment screws at the plug splice joint. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one reported incident, the exhaust plug nozzle separated from one engine while the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane was in flight. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent separation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exhaust nozzle plug from the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, three operators have reported four incidents of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loose or missing attachments at the splice joint of the engine forward and aft exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plugs. These discrepancies were found on airplanes subsequent to the accomplishment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD 83&hyph;02&hyph;05. One operator reported loss of the rear exhaust plug on one airplane after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the engine sustained a bird strike. Investigation revealed that the cause of these loose or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
missing splice joint attachments was attributed to higher temperatures and vibration effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the engine exhaust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators also reported loose nuts at the forward plug-to-engine turbine flange 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attachments. The cause of these loose nuts has been attributed to high temperature and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incompatibility of the nut threads with associated threaded studs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These conditions, if not corrected, could result in reduced integrity of the engine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust plug installation, which may lead to separation of exhaust plugs from the airplane, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and create a hazard to persons and property on the ground. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;8&hyph;70 Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bulletin 78&hyph;112, Revision 2, dated March 8, 1994, that describes procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of the engine exhaust plug assemblies. The modification entails replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of existing fasteners with permanent fasteners having larger diameters; this will serve to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strengthen the splice installation and minimize the possibility of loose splice joint fasteners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, this modification entails replacement of existing nuts with nuts that are less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
susceptible to the effects of higher temperatures and have compatible thread pitch, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimizes the possibility of forward plug-to-engine turbine attachments becoming loose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 83&hyph;02&hyph;05 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require modification of the engine exhaust plug assemblies. The actions would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accomplishment of this modification would constitute terminating action for the currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required replacement and check. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 110 Model DC&hyph;8&hyph;70 series airplanes of the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 78 airplanes of U.S. registry would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 46 work hours per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane to accomplish the proposed modification, and that the average labor rate is $55 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $21,400 per airplane. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be $1,866,540, or $23,930 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the power transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit (PTU). This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue cracks found in the drain port 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housings of the PTU's on several airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to prevent failure of the PTU housing due to fatigue cracking, which could result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the loss of both hydraulic systems (until the PTU is shut off).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has received reports of cracked drain port housings found on the power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer units (PTU) installed on five McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In one incident, failure of the housing resulted in the loss of both hydraulic systems, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused the airplane to depart from the runway during taxi due to the loss of braking and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nose landing gear steering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation has revealed that the cause of the cracking is attributed to fatigue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further analysis of the hardware has indicated that the center housing and drain port 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing can crack before the design life of the PTU has been reached. This condition, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not corrected, could lead to the failure of the housings associated with the PTU, which in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turn could result in the loss of both hydraulic systems (until the PTU is shut off). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas Service Bulletin 29&hyph;53, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revision 1, dated April 21, 1994, that describes procedures for modification of the center 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing and drain port housing of the PTU. This modification entails replacing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently installed cast aluminum housings with wrought aluminum housings, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reidentifying the part number of the PTU. Such modification will ensure that the housings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the PTU design life requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require modification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the center housing and drain port housing of the PTU. The actions would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be accomplished in accordance with the McDonnell Douglas service bulletin described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed AD would not be applicable to airplanes that are equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vickers PV3&hyph;160 engine driven pumps. The FAA finds that this type of pump provides a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressurized flow of 21 gallons per minute and, in the event of a PTU crack or failure, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate of flow would be adequate to continue pressurizing the affected hydraulic system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 1,074 Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 578 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $2,912 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators is estimated to be $1,746,716, or $3,022 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80
series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the engine nose cowl.
This proposal is prompted by several in-flight incidents in which the engine nose cowl separated or nearly separated
from the airplane. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent separation of the engine nose cowl
from the airplane during severe vibration of the engine.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has received reports of several in-flight incidents that have occurred on McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80
series airplanes in which the engine nose cowl separated or nearly separated from these airplanes. Investigation
revealed that these separations occurred following severe vibration of the engine due to failures of the first stage
fan blade. The cause of these separations has been attributed to loose or missing attachment bolts of the engine nose
cowl. This condition, if not corrected, could result in separation of the engine nose cowl from the airplane during
severe vibration of the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;80 Alert Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bulletin A71&hyph;61, dated May 18, 1994, which describes procedures for modification of the left and right engine
nose cowls. This modification entails removal of attachment bolts and nutplates, replacement of nutplates with
self-locking nuts and washers on the engine ``A'' flange, and reversal of attachment bolt direction (bolthead facing
forward). This modification will ensure the integrity of the nose cowl attachment assembly so as to minimize the possibility
of separation of the engine nose cowl from the airplane during severe vibration of the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require modification of the left and right engine nose cowls. The actions would be required
to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.

There are approximately 1,062 McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 540
airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 6 work hours per
airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would
cost approximately $100 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $232,200, or $430 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA received from Asgrow Seed Co., Kalamzoo, MI 49004, pesticide petition (PP) 4E4310 on December 6, 1993, proposing
to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.
346a, to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance, the residues of the plant-pesticides watermelon mosaic virus-2
coat protein and zucchini yellow mosaic virus coat protein as expressed in Asgrow line ZW20 of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Cucurbita pepo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 L., and subsequent generations obtained through normal sexual reproduction. An amendment to this petition was received
on April 4, 1994, which changed the proposed exemption by including the genetic material necessary for the production
of these proteins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The squash plants identified as Asgrow line ZW20 have been genetically modified to produce the coat proteins of two
viruses which commonly infect squash plants (watermelon mosaic virus-2 and zucchini yellow mosaic virus). Production
of specific viral coat proteins by the plant will protect it from infection by those viruses. Viral coat proteins,
along with the genetic material (nucleic acids) necessary to produce them in the plant, are designated as plant pesticides
by EPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and all other relevant material have been evaluated. The data considered in support
of the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance include the following: Sequences of the engineered WMV2 and ZYMV
coat protein coding regions and their resulting coat proteins, Southern blots to show absence of NPT2 gene and non-T-DNA
sequences in ZW 20 squash, levels of WMV2 and ZYMV coat protein deduced from amino acid sequence, and levels of viral
coat proteins in fruit collected from local markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency agrees with the petitioner's contention that components of plant pathogenic viruses, as represented
by the protein coats of zucchini yellow mosaic virus and watermelon mosaic virus-2, present no health concerns when
expressed in edible portions of the plant. The data include evidence to support the lack of any NPT2 marker gene in the
ZW20 plants. Therefore, the only transgene expressed is the viral coat protein. The submitted data include results
of tests to determine the levels of the proteins in market-ready fruit from line ZW20 and related this information
to the normal levels of these viruses in cucurbit fruits pruchased at local markets. These data demonstrated that,
overall, the levels of viral coat proteins in locally grown cucurbit plants were higher than those expressed in the
transgenic squash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for specific viral coat proteins WMV2 and ZYMV is based on the following:
(1) Virus-infected plants have always been a part of the human and domestic animal food supply since most crops are
frequently infected with plant viruses, and food from these crops has been and is being consumed without observed
adverse human health effects; (2) plant viruses have never been shown to be infectious to humans or mammals. Plant
viruses are not able to replicate in mammals or other vertebrates. Thus, there is no possibility of human infection.
In addition, only the portion of the viral genome coding for the whole coat protein or a subcomponent of the coat protein
will be expressed in the ZW20 plants. This portion by itself is incapable of forming infectious particles. Since whole
intact plant viruses are not known to cause deleterious human health effects, it is reasonable to assume that a subunit
of these viruses likewise will not cause adverse human health effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asgrow Seed Co. amended its petition to include the genetic material necessary for the production of the proteins
because EPA considers such genetic material to be part of the plant-pesticide product. It is the genetic material
that is introduced into the plant with the intent that it will ultimately result in a pesticidal effect (i.e., the plant
will produce the viral coat protein). Moreover, the pesticidal proteins could not be produced without the genetic
material being present in the plant. The exemption from a tolerance for the genetic material which codes for the production
of the viral coat proteins is based on the fact that the nucleic acids which form the genetic material are found in all
foods and have not, by themselves, been associated with toxic or pathogenic effects on animals and humans. None of
these constituents of nucleic acids are know to be acute toxicants by themselves but, like proteins and other normal
constituents of food, may cause indirect, adverse metabolic effects if consumed exclusively at high doses over a
long period of time in the absence of a normal balanced diet. Nucleic acids will not occur at these high amounts in ZW20
plants. Thus, EPA does not believe there is any potential for adverse health effects related to the consumption of
the ZW20 plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data and information submitted with this petition are acceptable and are adequate to show that there are no forseeable
human or domestic health hazards likely to arise from the consumption of fruit from the Asgrow line ZW20 of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cucurbita pepo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 L.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acceptable daily intake (ADI) and maximum permissible intake (MPI) considerations are not relevant to this petition
because the data submitted demonstrate that these plant pesticides are not toxic to humans. No enforcement actions
are expected based upon the level of residues of viral coat proteins and the genetic material necessary for their production.
Therefore, the requirement for an analytical method for enforcement purposes is not applicable to this exemption
request. This will be the first exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for this plant pesticide.

The plant pesticides in the Asgrow squash line ZW20 are considered useful for the purpose for which the exemption from
the requirement of a tolerance is sought. Based on the information considered, the Agency concludes that establishment
of the exemption will protect the public health. Therefore, the regulation is proposed as set forth below.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA issued a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 3, 1989 (54 FR 5502), in which it announced that the Y-Tex Corp., P.O. Box 1450, 1825 Big Horn Ave., Cody,
WY 82414, had requested that the Administrator amend 40 CFR 180.1001(e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement
of a tolerance under section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a(e)) for acrylonitrile-butadiene
copolymer, FD &amp; C Yellow No. 6 aluminum lake, 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)benzotriazole and octadecyl
3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate when used as components of ear tags and similar slow-release devices
in pesticide formulations applied to animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment was received in response to the proposed rule. The commenter claimed that among the bases for approval
of the acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is an erroneous interpretation of the results of a risk assessment conducted
by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the bases for approval listed in the proposed rule under the subheading ``acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer''
references an FDA risk assessment for acrylonitrile monomer and states, ``.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;the worst
case exposure to this monomer would result in an upper daily lifetime oncogenic risk of less than 1.2 X 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&hyph;7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, based upon a daily lifetime consumption of 1,060 grams of soft drinks contained in acrylonitrile/styrene plastic
beverage bottles (from which the monomer might be expected to migrate) with acrylonitrile monomer concentration
not exceeding 80 ppm.'' The quoted language (49 FR 36635; September 19, 1984) was part of the preamble of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document that amended the food additive regulations at 21 CFR 177.1040(c) to add a description of an acrylonitrile/styrene
copolymer suitable for use in packaging soft drinks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter noted that the maximum residual acrylonitrile monomer content of a finished article intended for such
use is specified in the regulation as 0.10 ppm rather than 80 ppm. The FDA assessment of risk used as a basis of approval
was based upon the 0.10-ppm value. In addition, the commenter asserted that the barrier properties of the acrylonitrile/styrene
copolymer that is the subject of 21 CFR 177.1040 are such that the migration of the residual acrylonitrile monomer
would occur more slowly and to a lesser extent than would be the case for the acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer for
which the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance was proposed. For the reasons cited above, the commenter claimed
that EPA's citation of the FDA calculation of the lifetime risk from exposure to monomeric acrylonitrile does not
support the action proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees with the comment and in response EPA has decided to reissue a proposal to establish an exemption from the
requirement of a tolerance for the acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer that includes a revised calculation of lifetime
risk from exposure to monomeric acrylonitrile.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Application of Assessment in Proposed Rulemaking
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Exposure to Acrylonitrile Monomer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data provided by the petitioner regarding the levels of acrylonitrile monomer typically expected to be present in
the subject acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer indicate that the concentration does not exceed 1 part per million
(ppm). Using this concentration of acrylonitrile monomer and the conditions of use of the acrylonitrile-butadiene
copolymer in animal ear tags, an estimation of exposure to acrylonitrile monomer resulting from the use of acrylonitrile-butadiene
copolymer as a component of an animal tag or similar devices was conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following assumptions were incorporated into a ``worst-case'' exposure assessment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The subject acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer contains a residual acrylonitrile monomer concentration of
1 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The copolymer comprises 50% of the weight of the tag.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The tag weight does not exceed 15 grams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each animal wears two tags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The animal weighs 800 pounds (363.2 kilograms). This would correspond to the lower range of weight for beef cattle,
the predominant wearers of insecticidal animal tags.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. All acrylonitrile monomer present in the tags migrates into the animal and is not metabolized and/or excreted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A human diet of 3,000 grams per day consists solely of meat emanating from cattle wearing tags containing acrylonitrile
monomer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
These ``worst-case'' assumptions produce an estimate of human acrylonitrile monomer dietary consumption of 0.12
microgram per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Toxicity of Acrylonitrile Monomer
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described in the previously cited 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document establishing a food-additive regulation for acrylonitrile-styrene copolymer, the FDA's Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition Cancer Assessment Committee concluded from its quantitative risk assessment that
acrylonitrile monomer exposure corresponding to an upper-limit lifetime risk of 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&hyph;6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, i.e., 1 in 1 million, is about 0.5 to 1.0 microgram per day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Extrapolation of Risk for Acrylonitrile Monomer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using the above FDA quantitative risk assessment and the ``worst-case'' exposure estimate, EPA concludes that the
upper-limit individual lifetime risk for acrylonitrile monomer resulting from the use of acrylonitrile-butadiene
copolymer as a component of an animal ear tag is about 1.2 X 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&hyph;7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to 2.4 X 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&hyph;7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or slightly more than 1 in 7 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the numerous conservative assumptions included in the worst-case exposure estimate, lifetime-averaged
individual exposure to acrylonitrile monomer is expected to be significantly less than the estimated exposure and,
therefore, the calculated upper-bound risk would be significantly less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Additional Bases of Approval
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of certain chemical substances which are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria
which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify
polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that
typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects.
In addition, these criteria exlcude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting
the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer conforms to the definition
of a polymer given in 40 CFR 723.250(b)(11) and meets the following criteria which are used to identify low-risk polymers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The minimum number average molecular weight of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is greater than 1,000. Substances
with molecular weights greater than 400 are generally not readily absorbed through the intact skin, and substances
with molecular weights greater than 1,000 are generally not absorbed through the intact gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
Chemicals not absorbed through the skin or GI tract are generally incapable of eliciting a toxic response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is not a cationic polymer nor is it reasonably expected to become a cationic
polymer in a natural aquatic environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer does not contain less than 32.0 percent by weight of the atomic element carbon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer contains as an integral part of its composition the atomic elements carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer does not contain as an integral part of its composition, except as impurities,
any elements other than those listed in 40 CFR 723.250(d)(3)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is not a biopolymer, a synthetic equivalent of a biopolymer, or a derivative
or modification of a biopolymer that is substantially intact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is not manufactured from reactants containing, other than as impurities,
halogen atoms or cyano groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer does not contain reactive functional groups that are intended or reasonably
anticipated to undergo further reaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer is not designed or reasonably anticipated to substantially degrade, decompose,
or depolymerize. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the information above and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this ingredient is useful and that the establishment of a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public
health. Therefore, EPA proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, which contains the ingredient listed herein, may request, within
30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of FFDCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [OPP&hyph;300296]. All written comments filed in response to this petition
will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposed rule that would amend primarily the regulations that govern how the Secretary of the Interior, through
the Bureau of Land Management, administers livestock grazing was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 March 25, 1994 (59 FR 14314). That proposed rule is a part of the Department's Rangeland Reform '94, an effort to improve
the administration of grazing. The original comment period on the proposed rule was to end on July 28, 1994. The comment
period is being extended until September 9, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the development of the proposed rule and since the opening of the comment period on the Rangeland Reform '94
proposal, the Governors of several States have organized groups to consider the Department's proposals. The Governor
of Wyoming has established one such group which is developing comments and alternative actions to be considered.
The Governor of Wyoming has requested an extension of the comment period to provide the Wyoming working group sufficient
time to complete their model for rangeland reform. In keeping with the Department's intent to encourage collaborative
efforts in the resolution of difficult public land management issues, the comment period on the proposed rule is being
extended until September 9, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elements of Rangeland Reform '94 have been analyzed through a draft environmental impact statement (EIS), notice
of which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 13, 1994 (59 FR 25118). The Forest Service is a cooperating agency in the preparation of the EIS. The comment period
on the draft EIS ends August 11, 1994, but the Department is considering the need to extend the EIS comment period to
coincide with the closing of the comment period on the related proposed rule. Any extension of the comment period for
the draft EIS will be made through a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A key provision of the Department's proposed rule published March 25, 1994, would raise the Federal grazing fee to
a level more closely reflecting market value. Under the proposed rule the grazing fee would be charged for each animal
unit month (AUM) of grazing on Federal lands. An AUM was defined, for billing purposes, as a month's use and occupancy
of range by one cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, burro, mule, five sheep, or five goats, over the age of six months at
the time of entering the public lands or other lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM); for all such
weaned animals regardless of age; and for such animals that will become 12 months of age during the authorized period
of use. This document requests comment from the public regarding whether the definition of an AUM for billing purposes,
as it pertains to sheep, should be six or seven sheep, rather than five sheep. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department solicits comments on this aspect of the proposed rule in recognition of the decline in the number of
sheep operators and number of sheep AUMs authorized on public lands over the last 20 years. During the period of 1975
through 1993 the number of sheep operators using public rangelands administered by the BLM dropped from 2,490 to 1,624.
During the same period the number of AUMs authorized for sheep use dropped from about 1.8 million to about 1.2 million.
The decline in sheep grazing on the public lands may be attributed to a number of factors, but has resulted in a shift
from sheep to cattle in many areas where grazing by sheep would be environmentally and administratively preferable.
It has come to the attention of the Department that the long-term trend in the shift from sheep to cattle may be accelerated
by recent changes in market factors such as the phase-out of wool incentive and unshorn lamb payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public is asked to provide information addressing whether or how the proposed rule might affect the long-term
trend in the shift from sheep to cattle. In particular, the Department is inviting comment on the effect of changing
the definition of an AUM for billing purposes in a manner that would reduce the proposed grazing fee that would be charged
for the use of public lands by sheep by 17 percent if the number of sheep per billing unit would be changed from five to
six, or 28 percent if changed from five to seven. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An adjustment in the definition of an AUM for billing purposes would not affect the manner in which sheep stocking rates
are determined. It would only affect the price paid for the use of public lands by sheep. Stocking rates are determined
by, among other things, assessing the capacity of the public lands for a given kind of livestock. The equivalency between
cattle and sheep expressed in the definition of an AUM for billing purposes is not used by the BLM in determining stocking
rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department intends that any change in the definition of an AUM for billing purposes would not affect the proposed
30 percent incentive fee reduction.

Due to the great volume of comments already received and anticipated on this proposed rule, the Department requests
that reviewers identify the specific section and paragraph label for the regulatory text on which they are commenting.

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.

The Department has prepared an initial Small Entity Flexibility Analysis analyzing the economic impact of the March
25, 1994 rulemaking (59 FR 14314) on small entities pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The anticipated effects of this additional request would be consistent with the analysis prepared for the March
25, 1994, proposed rule. The initial analysis is available at the address provided above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This additional request for comment on the proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12630, the Attorney
General Guidelines, Department of the Interior Guidelines, and the Attorney General Supplemental Guidelines to
determine the takings implications of the proposed rule if it were promulgated as currently drafted. The Department

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that the proposed rule meets the applicable standards
provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

To qualify for certain of these licenses, an applicant must pass an examination(s) that is administered by one of the
nine Commission-certified Commercial Operator License Examination (COLE) Managers. Within 10 days of completion
of an examination element(s), the COLE Manager must issued a Proof-of-Passing Certificate (PPC) to an examinee who
scores a passing grade on an examination element. When the examinee is credited for all examination elements required
for the commercial operator license sought, the examinee applies to the Commission for the license. The Commission
then processes the application and, if the applicant is fully qualified, grants the license. Total processing time
may be as much as eight weeks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We are dedicated to providing better and friendlier service to our customers. One significant way we can further
this goal is by permitting applicants who have passed the qualifying examinations and applied for a commercial radio
operator license to perform the functions of a commercial radio operator prior to receiving the Commission license.
This would be a significant benefit to persons who must have the license as a condition of employment by allowing them
to start work immediately. Providing for such temporary conditional operating authority would product a secondary
benefit by likely applicants receiving their Commission-issued licenses sooner because there would be a reduction
in the number of inquiries to the processing staff regarding the status of pending applications. Answering such inquires
diverts resources from the primary task of processing license applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. We propose to amend &sect;&sect;13.9 and 13.13 of the Commission's Rules to provide temporary conditional operating
authority to successful examinee upon properly filing an application with the Commission. This proposed temporary
operating authority, however, would not apply to any person who has previously had a commercial radio operator license
revoked, suspended, or is the subject of an ongoing suspension proceeding. In addition, the proposed rules provide
that the Commission, in its discretion, may cancel the temporary conditional operating authority without a hearing,
if the need for such action arises.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. For purposes of making log entries, the Commission proposed that a commercial radio operator exercising temporary
conditional operating authority would enter the PPC serial number and date of issue in place of the FCC-issued license
serial number and expiration date. Possession of the PPC document would activate the operating authority of proposed
&sect;13.9(d) and &sect;13.13(d) and would thereby serve in the stead of the license temporarily and conditionally.
This procedure would be verifiable and simple to implement.

Objectives:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule making proceeding is initiated to obtain comments concerning proposed rule changes to Part 13 of the Rules
to permit a person who has passed the examinations necessary to qualify for a commercial radio operator license, but
who has not yet received the license, to temporarily and conditionally perform the functions of a commercial radio
operator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mercury-containing lamps (light bulbs) may be hazardous waste under the Toxicity Characteristic Rule issued under
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and if so, must be managed as a hazardous waste, unless they are a
household waste or are generated by an exempted small quantity generator. Mercury-containing lamps include fluorescent,
high pressure sodium, mercury vapor and metal halide lamps. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is today seeking
comment on two alternative approaches for the management of mercury-containing lamps. First, EPA is seeking comment
on whether an exclusion from regulation as hazardous waste is appropriate for mercury lamps, provided they are disposed
in municipal landfills that are permitted by States/Tribes with EPA approved municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill
permitting programs or managed in mercury reclamation facilities that are permitted, licensed or registered by
States/Tribes. The second approach would add mercury lamps to EPA's Universal Waste Proposal (February 11, 1993,
58 FR 8102). The Universal Waste approach is a streamlined, reduced regulatory structure, which is designed to address
the management of certain widely generated wastes currently subject to full Subtitle C RCRA regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's proposal presents management options that would be considered less stringent than the existing Federal
regulations because they would exempt certain activities now within the purview of RCRA Subtitle C (hazardous waste
management). Therefore, States authorized under RCRA section 3006 to administer and enforce a hazardous waste system
in lieu of the Federal program would be allowed flexibility in modifying their programs to adopt less stringent regulations
regarding the management of mercury-containing lamps, should one of the proposed options be promulgated as a final
rule.

A. The Toxicity Characteristic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under section 3001 of the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) is charged with defining which solid wastes are hazardous by identifying the characteristics of hazardous
waste and by listing particular hazardous wastes. Toxicity is one of the four characteristics used by EPA to identify
waste as hazardous (along with ignitability, corrosivity, and reactivity). EPA promulgated the Extraction Procedure
Toxicity Characteristic (EPTC) on May 19, 1980. The EPTC regulated eight metals, four insecticides, and two herbicides.
Section 3001(g) of RCRA, added by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, required EPA to revise the
EPTC. On March 29, 1990 (55 FR 11798), the EPA promulgated the Toxicity Characteristic (TC) to revise the existing
EPTC. Like the EPTC, the TC and its associated testing methodology, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure
(TCLP) is used to define the toxicity of a waste by measuring the potential for the toxic constituents in the waste to
leach out of an unlined municipal landfill into groundwater and contaminate drinking water wells at levels of health
or environmental concern if not subject to Subtitle C controls. The TC implemented an improved leaching procedure
that better predicts leaching and added several hazardous waste constituents. Twenty-five organic hazardous waste
constituents were added to the TC and a model was developed to predict their fate and transport in the groundwater.
If wastes exhibit the Toxicity Characteristic they are subject to the hazardous waste management requirements of
RCRA Subtitle C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the preamble to the Toxicity Characteristic Rule (March 29, 1990, 55 FR 11813), the regulatory levels
for the TC metals were not changed by the promulgation of the final TC rule. EPA retained the regulatory levels set by
the EPTC rule, pending further study of the fate and transport of metals in groundwater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is continuing longer-term developmental work on a metal speciation model, called MINTEQ, to be used to
evaluate the fate and transport of the TC metals (including mercury) for purposes of reassessing the toxicity characteristic
regulatory levels for the TC metals. EPA's preliminary analysis indicates that mercury that would leach out of landfills
would not all necessarily travel far enough through the groundwater to contaminate drinking water wells, depending
on the distance to the well. A certain percent (still to be determined) will combine with other substances in the soil
(via complexation, adsorption, etc.) to form solid substances and remain in the soil. Therefore, the regulatory
limits for mercury if re-assessed using the MINTEQ model, when completed, might be higher (less stringent) than the
current limits because mercury may be less mobile than the current TC rule indicates. However, these studies are still
ongoing (U.S. EPA, 1991b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Available data (included in the docket for this proposal) indicate that as a result of the use of mercury in the production
of fluorescent and high intensity discharge (HID) lamps, a relatively high percentage of these lamps, when spent,
exhibit the characteristic of toxicity. (U.S. EPA, 1992a) However, all generators of spent lamps that exhibit the
toxicity characteristic may not have to manage those lamps as hazardous waste. EPA has specified different requirements
for generators of hazardous waste depending on the amount of hazardous waste generated per month. Conditionally-exempt
small quantity generators (CESQG) generate less than 100 kilograms (kg) of hazardous waste each month and can send
their waste to a hazardous waste facility, or may elect to send their wastes to a landfill or other facility approved
by the State for industrial or municipal non-hazardous wastes (see 40 CFR 261.5). Generators of more than 100 kg of
hazardous waste per month are required to fully comply with Federal hazardous waste regulations (although generators
of between 100 and 1000 kg of hazardous waste per month are subject to certain reduced regulatory requirements).

For the purposes of this proposal ``electric lamp'' also referred to as ``lamp'' is defined as the bulb or tube portion
of a lighting device specifically designed to produce radiant energy, most often in the ultraviolet, visible, and
infra-red regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples of common electric lamps include but are not limited
to, incandescent, fluorescent, high intensity discharge, and neon lamps. Also, a ``mercury-containing lamp''
is defined as an electric lamp in which mercury is purposely introduced by the manufacturer for the operation of the
lamp. The Agency requests comment on whether the definitions of ``lamp'' and ``mercury-containing lamp'' are technically
correct and on whether they accurately define the appropriate universe of items.

B. Energy-Efficient Lighting Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Today's proposal, which would reduce management requirements for lamps, is expected to support the efforts of many
existing and planned energy conservation programs, which encourage the installation of energy efficient lighting.
Energy efficient lighting consumes less electricity, reducing the generation of pollution from power plants. However,
replacing energy inefficient lighting systems with energy efficient lighting systems requires the use and eventual
disposal of fluorescent and high intensity discharge (HID) lamps, which contain mercury. Requiring the disposal
of lamp wastes as hazardous waste, under full Subtitle C regulations, may discourage participation in energy efficient
lighting programs. The Agency anticipates that either of the proposed actions will encourage participation in energy-efficient
lighting programs, and will therefore promote the energy-efficiency and the environmental benefits derived from
that program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If energy-efficient lighting were used wherever it is profitable, the nation's demand for electricity could be cut
by more than 10 percent. This would result in reductions of estimated annual carbon dioxide emissions of 202 million
metric tons (4 percent of the national total), reductions of annual sulfur dioxide emissions of 1.3 million metric
tons (7 percent of the national total), and reductions of annual nitrogen oxide emissions of 600,000 metric tons (4
percent of the national total). (U.S. EPA, 1992b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, EPA initiated a voluntary energy conservation program called ``Green Lights'' to encourage pollution prevention
through energy efficient lighting. Lighting accounts for 20&hyph;25 percent of electricity used annually in the
U.S. Lighting for industry, businesses, offices, and warehouses represents 80&hyph;90 percent of total lighting
electricity use. Available technologies in energy efficient lighting can reduce lighting electricity demand by
over 50 percent, enabling power plants to generate less electricity and burn less fuel. It also reduces other types
of pollution resulting from mining and transporting power plant fuels and disposing of power plant wastes (U.S. EPA,
1992b). In addition, electric utilities, when burning fossil fuels, emit mercury at a rate of 0.0428 mg/kWh sold,
on a national average. Full implementation of Green Lights is estimated to reduce the emission by 9.7 Mg of mercury
by the year 2000 (U.S. EPA, 1992b). Further, the energy-efficient fluorescent lamps, used by Green Lights and other
energy conservation programs, contain less mercury than energy-inefficient fluorescent lamps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A goal of Green Lights is to encourage the widespread use of efficient lighting technologies to reduce air pollution
from coal combustion. Energy-efficient lighting technologies provide excellent investment opportunities. A
typical lighting upgrade yields an internal rate of return of 20&hyph;30 percent and a payback of 3&hyph;4 years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Green Lights participants include: Corporations; State, city, and county governments; lighting manufacturing
and management companies; electric utilities; non-profit organizations; and hospitals, universities, and other
businesses throughout the U.S. Green Lights encourages the establishment of comprehensive energy-efficient lighting
programs within an organization that include: Converting from less-efficient fluorescent to more-efficient fluorescent
lamps; converting from incandescent to compact fluorescent lamps; converting from magnetic to electronic lighting
ballasts; installing occupancy sensors, daylight dimmers, and other lighting control technologies; installing
more efficient luminaries or lighting fixtures; and efficient maintenance practices, such as group relamping and
regular fixture cleaning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By signing a partnership agreement with the EPA, Green Lights participants agree to survey and upgrade, within 5 years,
90 percent of all domestic facilities wherever profitable and wherever lighting quality is improved or maintained.
In return, these participants should receive reductions (savings) in their monthly energy expenses. A good energy-efficient
lighting upgrade typically includes some type of control strategy (such as occupancy sensors) that will reduce lamp
burning hours. The result is that the lamp will last longer and need to be replaced less frequently. As of June 30, 1993,
over 1,000 organizations have joined the Green Lights program. These organizations have committed over 3.5 billion
square feet of facility space to the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Green Lights Program encourages the use of energy-efficient lamps using an initial and scheduled periodic relampings
to achieve higher energy efficiency and reduce energy costs. These relampings involve removal and replacement of
all lamps in a building or in an area at one time, as opposed to replacement of lamps as they burn out. An initial lighting
upgrade and group relamping may result in a large number of fluorescent lamps that require disposal. In some instances,
a participant that would usually be a conditionally exempt small quantity generator, could become a large quantity
generator of hazardous waste due to the large number of lamps generated in one month. In general, if a generator disposes
of more than approximately 350 four foot fluorescent lamps, that generator is a large quantity generator due to lamps
alone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the environmental and financial benefits of energy efficient lighting systems, there are disincentives
to participating in an energy conservation program like Green Lights. Establishing a comprehensive energy-efficient
lighting program and installing energy-efficient lighting technologies require an initial investment that may
be significant, depending on the size and comprehensiveness of the project. Although Green Lights provides information
to participants on financing options, many profitable lighting upgrade projects are delayed due to restricted availability
of capital. It is especially difficult for smaller businesses and government organizations to raise the necessary
capital, although energy-efficient lighting investments are low risk and in the long run will reduce costs. The additional
costs associated with managing, transporting, and disposing of lighting wastes as hazardous wastes can create an
additional disincentive to join Green Lights and make the initial investment in energy-efficient light technologies.
For example, under the hazardous waste regulations, large quantity generators are required to label boxes and drums,
notify EPA of status as a hazardous waste generator, transport waste via a hazardous waste transporter, manage waste
consistent with the land disposal restrictions, and manage waste at a hazardous waste management facility. In addition,
on May 8, 1994, generators of mercury-containing lamps will be required (under the Land Disposal Restrictions) to
meet a treatment standard for lamps as hazardous debris. As is discussed in detail in Section VII, Economic Impact
Analysis, of this preamble, the Agency estimates that the annual national cost of Subtitle C compliance for large
quantity generators could range from 110 to 134 million dollars. EPA's preliminary estimates suggest that an exclusion
would save generators of mercury containing lamps approximately 85 to 102 million dollars annually, while the inclusion
of lamps in the universal waste management system would save generators approximately 16 to 20 million dollars annually.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Green Lights program may increase the number of large quantity generators on months when mass relamping
occurs, the program is not expected to increase the total quantity of used fluorescent lamps in the long run. The lamps
recommended by the Green Lights program are more energy efficient and with implementation of energy saving practices,
these lamps could have an extended life of four to five years rather than the average three to four years. Therefore,
if by reducing the initial costs of participation in the Green Lights program, generators participate in the Green
Lights Program, an energy savings will occur. These additional energy savings will decrease the amount of mercury
and other pollutants emitted to in the atmosphere from coal-burning.

C. Industry Source Reduction Initiatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A report, ``The Management of Spent Electric Lamps Containing Mercury,'' by the National Electrical Manufacturers
Association (NEMA, 1992) discussed industry efforts to reduce mercury in fluorescent lamps. According to the report,
due to the use of more efficient dosing techniques (i.e., placing mercury in the lamp), the average mercury content
of a standard 4-foot, 11/2 inch diameter, cool white fluorescent lamp was reduced by 14% (48.2 mg/lamp to 41.6 mg/lamp)
from 1985 to 1990. Future industry projections of mercury reductions by 1995 show an estimated 35% further reduction
(41.6 mg/lamp to 27.0 mg/lamp) for the standard fluorescent lamp. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Source reduction, which is the reduction or elimination of the toxicity and/or volume of a waste product, is at the
top of EPA's hierarchy of municipal solid waste (MSW) management methods. With regard to mercury, the most significant
source reduction achievement has been the trend toward elimination of mercury from alkaline batteries. Although
these batteries are still a significant contributor of mercury to municipal solid waste, discards of mercury from
alkaline batteries are dropping dramatically because of source reduction achievement. Mercury-containing lamps
are one of the next highest single sources of mercury in the municipal solid waste, accounting for 3.8% of mercury now
going to MSW landfills. EPA encourages cost-effective source reduction of mercury in fluorescent lamps. Opportunities
exist to reduce mercury content levels in both standard 4-foot fluorescent lamps and the increasingly popular compact
fluorescent lamps (U.S. EPA, 1993b). If source reduction is pursued aggressively by the fluorescent lamp manufacturing
industry, the overall contribution of mercury from fluorescent lamps to municipal solid waste could remain constant
or decrease over time even as fluorescent lamp usage increases.

EPA requests comment on industry and other source reduction initiatives involving the reduction of mercury in fluorescent
lamps. Source reduction may be occurring through more efficient dosing techniques, lightweighting of lamps, and
changes in phosphor powder technology. The Agency requests comments reflecting these and any other source reduction
activities and may use this information to develop a strategy to support and encourage voluntary source reduction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This section presents the technical information used by the Agency in developing options for the management of used
mercury-containing lamps. Information is provided on the environmental fate and transport in the ground water and
air pathway for mercury. Specifically, EPA has reviewed leachate data from municipal landfills and data on air emissions
from municipal waste combustors and municipal landfills. In addition, the Agency has estimated possible releases
of mercury to the air from lamps broken during storage and transportation. Most of the information considered pertains
to management in municipal landfills. Information on other types of non-hazardous landfills is not presented due
to a lack of data and the wide variability in design and waste composition of other non-hazardous landfills.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comment on the data presented in this section of the preamble. These data, along with any data submitted
in the public comment to this proposal, will be used to determine the risk to human health and the environment from the
management of used mercury-containing lamps. Also, some information on the risks of managing mercury-containing
lamps in landfills, combustors and recovery facilities was submitted to the Agency in response to a request for such
information in the Universal Waste Proposal (February 11, 1993, 58 FR 8102). This information is included in the rulemaking
docket for today's proposal and the Agency requests comment on it.

A. Groundwater Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This section discusses leachate samples collected by EPA from municipal landfills. As previously discussed, the
Agency is further developing its groundwater model under the TC to accurately predict the movement of mercury through
the groundwater system. The groundwater pathway for mercury is being considered because the TC uses the groundwater
pathway to estimate the movement of contaminants from municipal landfills. The leachate data indicate that further
analysis may be needed on the behavior and movement of mercury in municipal landfills and in groundwater, although
initial analyses indicate that mercury is less mobile than previously believed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has collected data indicating that mercury may not leach from MSW landfills at levels above the drinking water
MCL, despite some mercury disposal in MSW landfills. EPA estimates that approximately 73% of municipal solid waste
(MSW) is placed in municipal landfills, while 14% of municipal solid waste is incinerated and 13% is recycled. Based
on a study of mercury production and use, the Agency estimates that about 643 metric tons (Mg) of mercury is discarded
in MSW landfills per year. A major source of mercury in municipal solid waste is household batteries which accounts
for about 88% of the 565 metric tons (Mg) of mercury in municipal solid waste. Most of these batteries fall under the
Household Waste Exclusion (see 45 FR 33119, May 19, 1980). Thermostats/thermometers and mercury-containing lamps
are second in their contribution of mercury in municipal solid waste, 3.9% and 3.8% respectively. The Agency estimates
that, assuming all lamps are disposed of in MSW landfills, approximately 20 Mg of mercury would be placed in MSW landfills
per year from used mercury-containing lamps. (U.S. EPA, 1991c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data on the amounts of mercury in MSW landfill leachate are included in a study summarizing the available data on MSW
landfill leachate characteristics conducted by the Office of Solid Waste (U.S. EPA, 1988). Out of 109 leachate mercury
analyses collected, only six (7 percent) were above the drinking water level or maximum contaminant level (MCL) for
mercury (0.002 mg/L) and none were above the Toxicity Characteristic (TC) limit for mercury (0.2 mg/L). The average
of these MSW leachate analyses was 0.0008 mg/L mercury. The maximum concentration reported is 0.0098 mg/L.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further analysis indicates that less than 0.01 percent of the mercury in MSW landfills leaches from the landfill.
This estimate is supported by a study measuring mercury disposition (in landfill gas and leachate) in four Swiss landfills
which found around .007 percent of the mercury from the landfill in the leachate (Baccini et al., 1987).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The behavior of mercury in a MSW landfill is not known in great detail. The complexity of aqueous mercury chemistry
makes it difficult to predict and model at this time. However, the available information suggests that chemical conditions
tend to favor the metallic form of mercury in MSW landfills. This form has a lower solubility in water (0.02&hyph;0.04
mg/L) than other chemical forms. In addition, EPA has identified studies that indicate that municipal solid waste
has a significant capacity for retaining mercury in the landfill unless there are unusually large quantities of mercury
in municipal solid waste (Gould et al., 1988/Mennerich, 1985). The Agency has not seen field data for industrial non-hazardous
landfills.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In addition, the Agency reviewed 1990 and 1991 Superfund Records of Decision (RODs) for information on municipal
landfill sites where mercury was listed as a contaminant of concern (COC). A total of twelve out of sixty-six 1990 and
1991 RODs for landfills accepting municipal waste listed mercury as a COC. Of these 12 sites, 5 had mercury detections
in ground-water over the MCL. All but one of these sites had confirmed industrial waste codisposal. At this site only
onsite ground-water exceeded the MCL for mercury (maximum of 0.013 mg/L); all offsite ground-water samples were
below detection limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, preliminary data and analysis suggest at this time that mercury in municipal solid wastes is not being
readily released by leaching processes that typically occur in the MSW landfill environment. This indication is
also supported by controlled leaching studies of high-concentration mercury-containing wastes codisposed with
municipal solid waste (Borden et al., 1990/Gould et al., 1988). However, the Agency requests that commenters provide
any MSW landfill leachate or groundwater data, or data from industrial Subtitle D landfills, that EPA has not considered
in its analysis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Agency is also reviewing data on the air pathway for mercury because low levels of mercury in surface water have
caused elevated fish concentrations at many sites in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, and other States,
and these elevated levels of mercury have been attributed to atmospheric deposition from non-specific sources (U.S.
EPA, 1993a). Therefore, EPA reviewed data on mercury emissions to air from a number of sources, including those potentially
related to lamp disposal. EPA also considered available data on the fate and transport of mercury of mercury emitted
to the air.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of elemental mercury's high vapor pressure, it is easily volatilized into the atmosphere. Two factors are
believed to contribute to the recent increases in atmospheric deposition of mercury compounds. The first factor
is increased atmospheric levels from mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, chloralkali plants, MWC facilities,
and other sources. The second factor is increased oxidation of atmospheric elemental mercury vapor to more soluble
oxidized forms which is enhanced by anthropogenic (i.e., pollution from man-made sources) increases in atmospheric
oxidizing agents, such as ozone and inorganic acids. Based on current mercury emissions inventories EPA believes
that major mercury emission source categories include coal fired power plants, municipal waste combustors and medical
waste combustors. (U.S. EPA, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mercury that is methylated is strongly biomagnified through the food chain through bioconcentration in animals,
and in plant tissue. Methylation is a chemical process in which a methyl unit is added to either elemental or oxidized
mercury. The primary environmental human exposure pathway for mercury is through the consumption of contaminated
fish. Fish bioconcentration factors (fish tissue concentration/water concentration) are as high as 85,000. Recently,
elevated levels of mercury in fish in isolated, pristine lakes have been identified in widespread areas around the
country. There are currently over 1,550 fish consumption bans or advisories due to mercury in effect in the United
States (Sorensen et al, 1990).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there may be insufficient data to determine whether mercury from lamps will endanger human health and environment
by the release of mercury to the air, there are concerns over emissions of mercury from lamps from municipal waste combustors,
possibly landfill gas, as well as concerns with the handling and disposal of mercury lamps. In this section, available
information will be discussed pertaining to the hazards of mercury via air exposure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Agency estimates that approximately 14% of U.S. municipal solid waste is burned in municipal waste combustors
(MWCs), comprising 23 million metric tons (Mg) of waste. Approximately 100 Mg of mercury-containing waste is burned
in municipal waste combustors, of which about 3 Mg/yr is mercury-containing lamps (U.S. EPA, 1990). Because of its
low boiling point, elemental mercury in the waste is largely vaporized during municipal waste combustion and, without
controls specific to mercury, passes out of the municipal waste combustor into the atmosphere with the flue gas. Measurements
have shown that for several municipal waste combustors with emissions controls for sulfur and nitrogen oxide particulates,
average MWC mercury emission factors range from 70 to 90 percent of the mercury input (Vogg et al, 1986/Reiman, 1989).
If we assume that 98% of the mercury in incinerated municipal solid waste is volatilized during combustion this would
potentially generate 98 Mg/year mercury emissions of this, about 2.9 Mg/year would be from mercury-containing lamps.
Post-combustion mercury control at the municipal waste combustor's would reduce mercury levels by 80% to 90%.

EPA plans to propose mercury emission limits for new and existing municipal waste combustors in 1994 (U.S. EPA, 1991a).
The mercury emission limits will be based on the use of activated carbon injection for mercury control as demonstrated
by EPA at tests at the Stanislaus municipal waste combustor (California) and Camden municipal waste combustor (New
Jersey). These tests demonstrated activated carbon injection technology as available for post-combustion mercury
control at municipal waste combustors and achieved mercury reduction levels of 80 to 90 percent. During the tests,
activated carbon was injected into the flue gases upstream of the acid gas control system and collected (with the mercury)
in the particulate matter control system. The ash from the particulate matter control system was then landfilled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is unclear to what degree the mercury being released from municipal waste combustors would contribute to increased
mercury levels in surface waters because the transport and cycling of atmospheric mercury emissions are complex
and poorly understood. It is uncertain how long mercury will stay in the atmosphere after being released. The oxidation
state of mercury dictates how long it remains in the air. Elemental mercury could stay in the atmosphere for months
to years, whereas an oxidized species of mercury would stay for only days to weeks. Although controversy remains over
the form of mercury as it leaves the MWC stack, it is likely that mercury from a municipal waste combustor would be more
oxidized and therefore would not remain in the atmosphere for a long period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, since MWC facilities comprise one anthropogenic source of atmospheric mercury, there are probably regional-scale
or global-scale impacts from such sources (Glass et al., 1986/Johnson, 1987). The elimination of mercury-containing
lamps from municipal waste combustors would reduce annual atmospheric mercury emissions from these significant
sources by around 3 metric tons, or about 3 percent of the total mercury-bearing waste that is incinerated. The Agency
is considering proposing air emission controls for mercury later this year which would, when implemented, reduce
these emissions.

(2) Mercury in Landfill Gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
EPA evaluated emissions of mercury in landfill gas emission in its ``Preliminary Risk Assessment'' which is available
in the public docket (EPA, 1993). EPA reviewed studies on the amount of mercury that may be released to the air from municipal
solid waste landfills. Specifically, this section presents in detail the results of two studies that attempt to measure
mercury air releases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Swiss study (Baccini et al., 1987) measured the amount of landfill gas from four municipal landfills. This study
is comparable to municipal solid waste landfills in the U.S. because the study indicated that these Swiss MSW landfills
contained approximately 2 parts per million (ppm) of mercury, which, given the standard error range, is comparable
to the approximately 3.6 ppm of mercury in U.S. municipal solid waste (U.S. EPA, 1990). The Swiss study indicated that
mercury concentrations in landfill gases had a mean value of about 0.4 &mu;g/cubic meter. The annual total mercury
release also was low (0.0065 mg/Mg waste, average). Using this gas release value, and the amount of municipal solid
waste annually disposed in U.S. landfills (118 million Mg), the amount of mercury annually released in landfill gas
can be estimated as 0.8 kg, about 0.0001 percent of the total mercury load entering MSW landfills (643 Mg). Adjusting
the proportion of total mercury contributed by mercury-containing lamps to the MSW stream (3.8 percent), provides
an estimate of annual landfill gas emissions from lamps of about 0.03 kg, less than 0.00001 percent of the total municipal
solid waste mercury input (EPA, 1993). The amount of mercury from lamps emitted into the atmosphere by landfill gas
is very small (.00003 Mg) when compared to the 3 Mg of mercury from lamps that is estimated to be emitted into the atmosphere
through municipal waste combustors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also received a study (National Environmental Protection Board et al, 1989) in a comment to the Universal Waste
Proposal that provided data on mercury gas from four municipal landfills in Sweden. The Swedish study measured the
ambient air quality above four municipal landfills. The study did not indicate the level of mercury in the municipal
landfills. Mercury was measured using differential optical adsorption spectroscopy (DOAS), located two meters
above the landfill, compared with background mercury concentrations measured at each of the four landfills. The
mean ranged from 10.2 ng/m

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

. The report stated that because all measurements were close to the detection limit for the DOAS technique, the reliability
of the results was questioned. After a review, it was determined that although the quantification was uncertain because
of a low signal-to-noise ratio, the concentration above the landfills was significantly above background mercury
levels, indicating that mercury was being released to the atmosphere. However, since it is unknown how much mercury
is found in Swedish municipal solid waste landfills, the results of this study cannot be readily compared to the situation
in the U.S.

(3) Crushing and Breakage of Lamps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mercury remains in lamps until they are broken. When lamps break, the elemental mercury inside becomes available
for evaporation, adsorption, or reaction. EPA modeled mercury emissions from broken lamps based on two different
methods of transportation (EPA, 1993). Discarded lamps may be transported in one of two ways: In refuse trucks as household
or commercial trash, and in closed vans or trailers as part of a bulk relamping program. Based on available information,
it was assumed for the purposes of this model that as much as 6.6% of mercury could be released in the air from a lamp broken
during the collection, storage and transport of mercury-containing lamps in garbage trucks. The Agency recognizes
that it is uncertain how much mercury is released from broken lamps. The amount of mercury released would vary depending
on the ambient air temperature, the time the broken lamps are directly exposed to the air and the number of lamps broken.
The Agency requests any available data concerning releases of mercury during storage, transportation and waste
management (e.g., landfill and recyclers) activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Technical Considerations and Request for Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The available data on landfill leachate suggests that mercury-containing lamps may not pose a threat to groundwater
when placed in a state-controlled municipal landfill due to the low levels of mercury found in landfill leachate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, available information also indicates that an important route of exposure for mercury is bioaccumulation
up the food chain, causing mercury poisoning to both wildlife and humans (i.e., through fish consumption). Although
it is unclear how mercury moves through the atmosphere and what conditions enhance or retard it, information suggests
that given the high vapor pressure of mercury, it can readily volatilize to the air and be transported, perhaps long
distances, and be deposited on surface water or soil (which can run off into surface water). Some mercury that is subsequently
methylated will bioaccumulate in the food chain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual amount of mercury released from fluorescent or HID lamps is unknown. It is estimated that lamps that are
incinerated will release 98% of their mercury due to the high temperatures needed for the incineration process. However,
because mercury is such a volatile metal, amounts of mercury could be released into the air from lamps broken during
transportation or lamps broken at the landfill. For purposes of this proposal, EPA has made assumptions on the amount
of mercury that may be released from a broken lamp but few studies have directly measured the amount of mercury released
from a lamp over time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More information on the air release, transport and exposure pathway for mercury is needed in order to better evaluate
the proper management methods for spent mercury-containing lamps. The Agency requests information on air transport
of mercury from mercury-containing lamps, the mercury methylation process (both in general and in landfills) and
any studies that directly measure the amount and form of mercury released from broken mercury-containing lamps.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Management Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information presented in this notice has led the Agency to re-evaluate the management of waste mercury-containing
lamps because of their importance in promoting energy-efficiency. As mentioned earlier in this notice, the use of
energy-efficient lighting can reduce mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants as well as emissions of carbon
dioxide and sulfur oxide. In light of the benefits derived from the use of these lamps, EPA is seeking comment on two
proposed options based the data which indicate that these lamps may be better managed either outside of the hazardous
waste system or in a reduced regulatory structure within the hazardous waste system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, since there remain uncertainties in the data, more information on the air exposure pathway for mercury from
lamps would facilitate a decision by EPA on the management of lamps. Additional information could clarify which kind
of reduced management structure would be most appropriate for mercury-containing lamps. The Agency has requested
that information, if available, be submitted with the public comment to this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given these technical uncertainties, EPA has developed two proposed alternative approaches for the management
of mercury-containing lamps. The first approach is a conditional exclusion for mercury-containing lamps from regulation
as hazardous waste. Under this approach, mercury-containing lamps would no longer be considered hazardous waste
provided that they are managed under the conditions of the exclusion. The second approach is to add mercury-containing
lamps to the universal waste management system, which was proposed for batteries and pesticides on February 11, 1993
(58 FR 8102). Under the universal waste management system, lamps that fail the TC would be considered hazardous waste,
but they would be subject to streamlined hazardous waste management requirements, which are described in detail
later in this notice. The major difference between these two options is whether lamps are disposed of under Subtitle
D requirements or under Subtitle C requirements. Recycling of lamps would be allowed under either option.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If EPA concludes, after considering data from the public comment on this proposal, that the risk from mercury release
from mercury-containing lamps is not significant enough to warrant Subtitle C regulation, the Agency may choose
to finalize a conditional exclusion. However, if EPA concludes, after considering data received in public comment
that the risk from mercury release from lamps is significant, the Agency may choose to keep mercury-containing lamps
in Subtitle C, under the universal waste management system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following sections describe the two approaches in detail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Conditional Exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3001 of RCRA charges EPA with identifying the characteristics of hazardous waste and listing particular
hazardous wastes. Section 1004(5) of RCRA defines waste as ``hazardous'' if the waste poses a ``substantial present
or potential hazard'' to human health or the environment when improperly managed. The groundwater data discussed
earlier in this notice suggest that mercury-bearing lamps, if they are disposed of according to the conditions of
the proposed exclusion, may not pose a substantial present or future threat to human health or the environment. Based
on the Agency's authority to identify characteristics of hazardous waste and the statutory definition of hazardous
waste, EPA is considering whether an exclusion of used mercury-containing lamps from regulation as hazardous waste
would be appropriate. EPA requests comment on the data presented in the proposal, as well as on whether to exclude these
lamps from regulation as hazardous waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exclusion under consideration today has two conditions. In order to qualify for the exclusion: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1)(a) Generators would be required to either dispose of these lamps in a municipal solid waste landfill that is permitted
by a State/Tribe with an EPA-approved MSW permitting program, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If generators do not send these lamps to a MSW landfill, they would send them to a State permitted, licensed, or registered
mercury reclamation facility; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Generators would be required to keep a record of the lamps shipped to management facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing to limit the exclusion to spent lamps disposed in MSW landfills (requirements of MSW landfills
are discussed later in this section), rather than allowing disposal in any nonhazardous waste landfill, because
EPA has field data on leachate (including mercury levels) only for MSW landfills (among Subtitle D facility categories).
The available information (discussed above) suggests that the amount of mercury from mercury-containing lamps
that is released from MSW landfill gas is very small and its effect on ambient air quality may not pose a significant
hazard to human health or the environment. EPA requests any information on the levels and impacts of mercury in MSW
landfill gas. Further, data on leachate quality and air emissions from other nonhazardous waste landfills, including
industrial solid waste landfills, is very limited. However, some soil column data also suggest that mercury dissolution
into soil pore water occurs at very low levels (Eichholz et al., 1986). EPA requests comment on this approach and any
information on mercury releases from other nonhazardous waste landfills. Based on EPA's existing data and any additional
data received, EPA may expand the exclusion to include disposal in non-municipal, solid waste, Subtitle D disposal
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this proposed exclusion from Subtitle C of RCRA is supported by data from municipal solid waste landfills with
a range of design and operating conditions, EPA believes that limiting the exclusion to spent lamps disposed only
in MSW landfills that are permitted by States or Tribes with EPA-approved MSW landfill permitting programs will provide
further assurance that human health and the environment will be protected. In particular, these MSW landfill permitting
controls will provide added protection to the management of these lamps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1991, EPA promulgated new requirements for municipal solid waste landfills (40 CFR Part 258, October 9,
1991, 56 FR 51016). These requirements cover location restrictions, landfill design and operations, groundwater
monitoring, corrective action measures, financial assurance, and conditions for closing the landfill and post
closure care. The majority of landfill owners/operators accepting greater than 100 tons per day must comply with
the majority of the requirements by October 9, 1993. On October 1, 1993 (58 FR 51536), EPA delayed the October 9, 1993
effective date for six months for landfills accepting less than 100 tons per day (in addition to other criteria) and
delayed the effective date for two years for landfills in arid or remote regions that accept less than 20 tons per day.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States/tribes are in the process of incorporating these new municipal solid waste landfill standards into their
permitting programs and applying for EPA approval of their permitting programs. EPA is currently evaluating these
State permitting programs to determine their adequacy in incorporating the new municipal solid waste landfill criteria
(40 CFR part 258). As of June 30, 1993, EPA approved thirty-six State municipal solid waste landfill programs. In addition,
EPA is actively reviewing numerous State permitting program applications and expects to approve the remaining State
landfill permitting programs by April 1994, well before this proposed rule would become effective as a final rule.
EPA expects to issue ``partial'' program approvals to some States because their landfill permitting programs may
not fully address all elements of the EPA municipal solid waste landfill criteria. For purposes of today's rule, EPA
would consider ``partial'' program approvals, as well as ``full'' program approvals, to be ``EPA-approved'' State
municipal solid waste landfill permitting programs. Further, States with ``partial'' approval have agreed to an
EPA approved schedule for full approval. The Agency believes that limiting today's proposed exclusion to landfills
that are permitted by States that have incorporated EPA's new municipal landfill standards will provide further
assurance that spent lamps will be safely managed in municipal solid waste landfills. EPA requests comment on this
approach and any alternative approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second condition, which limits the proposed exclusion to lamps managed in State permitted, licensed, or registered
mercury reclamation facilities, is also consistent with the Agency's support for environmentally sound reclamation
of waste. EPA believes that with adequate State oversight, mercury containing lamps can be safely recycled and the
mercury reclaimed from them. However, EPA is concerned that, in States without oversight over recyclers, recycling
activities could pose a threat to human health and the environment because of inadequate or non-existent waste management
controls. Therefore, the Agency is requesting information on recycling operations and practices. EPA is aware that
several technologies are available to recycle lamps and recover mercury from them. However, the Agency does not have
complete information on which technologies are currently being used by recycling companies and if these technologies
can address all different kinds of lamps (e.g., tube, U-shaped, compact, etc.). The Agency also seeks information
that tracks mercury as it moves through the recycling process. Further, EPA would like to know the operating capacity
of existing or planned reyclers of mercury-containing lamps. The Agency is also requesting information on what markets
exist for the mercury and other materials recovered from lamps. This information will be useful to the Agency in understanding
and assessing possible risks to human health and the environment as well as to determine the potential or actual use
of the materials recovered from lamps in the market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the conditional exclusion, regulated lamp generators (i.e., those that generate more than the conditional-exempt
small quantity generator (CESQG) limit of 100 kilograms of hazardous waste per month which would be about 350 mercury-containing
lamps) would not be able to send lamps to a municipal waste combustor for disposal. EPA does not propose to extend the
exclusion to lamps disposed in municipal waste combustors because of concern over mercury air emissions from these
sources. However, this proposed option would not affect municipal waste combustors' ability to continue the combustion
of traditional municipal solid waste which contains limited quantities of unregulated household or CESQG mercury-containing
lamps. Because mercury-containing lamps do not burn, it is unlikely that truck loads of mercury-containing lamps
(i.e., containing more than 350 lamps) would have been acceptable to most operators. The exclusion would assure that
this disposal alternative is not considered in any situation. The Agency requests comment on the proposal to limit
the exclusion to permitted municipal solid waste landfills (i.e., regulated lamp generators would not be allowed
to send lamps to a municipal waste combustor for disposal). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also requests comment on adding to the exclusion handling requirements to minimize mercury emissions during
storage and transportation (e.g., packaging to reduce breakage). These management controls could be the same as
those proposed in the universal waste management system. The Agency is interested in data on the cost of and human health
protection provided by these handling requirements for lamps.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third condition is that generators taking advantage of the exclusion would be required to maintain a written certification
indicating the disposal or recycling location for the lamps. The proposed certification, to be signed by the generator
or its authorized representative, would state that on a specified date a specified amount of lamps was consigned to
a specified transporter for disposal or recycling at a specified facility. This certification would be required
for each shipment of lamps and would be maintained by the generator for three years from the date of shipment. The Agency
is proposing this documentation as a mechanism for verifying that the conditions of the exclusion have been met. Failure
to maintain the required documentation would disqualify the generator from eligibility for the exclusion. The existence
of the certification, however, would not protect a generator from an enforcement action if the lamps were not actually
disposed of or recycled in accordance with the conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing that separate documentation be required for each shipment based on its belief that most lamp
generation is sporadic (every three to four years), as opposed to on-going generation which would lead to a continuous
relationship with the same disposal or recycling facility. Given that the life span of mercury-containing lamps
is approximately three to four years, businesses that participate in mass relampings would only dispose of their
lamps every few years. Under the current hazardous waste regulations, many of these businesses would be subject to
hazardous waste regulation because mass relamping could cause them to exceed the conditionally-exempt small quantity
generator level (approximately 350 four foot lamps, if lamps are the only hazardous waste generated). However, small
businesses and other facilities that generate just under the CESQG limit of hazardous waste (100 kg per month) may
exceed this limit with attrition relamping. For these generators, this recordkeeping requirement could be more
burdensome. The Agency requests comments on whether there are alternative mechanisms that can be used by generators
to demonstrate compliance with the conditions of the exclusion. The Agency also requests comment on whether, if the
Agency determines that documentation is necessary to demonstrate compliance with the conditions, the form and frequency
of documentation proposed are appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to requesting comment on the conditions of the exclusion, the Agency requests comment on having a 3 to 5
year sunset provision on the exclusion. A sunset provision would require the Agency to re-evaluate the exclusion
after a period of three to five years, to determine whether an exclusion is indeed appropriate for lamps given any unanticipated
management or risk issues that develop as a result of the exclusion. The Agency would then determine whether to extend
the exclusion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Agency requests comments on other alternatives that still achieve the overall RCRA goal of protection
of human health and the environment. EPA is interested in data on the benefits, costs, and legal authority for any alternatives
and the Agency will consider such options.

B. Universal Waste Management System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 11, 1993, EPA proposed a streamlined, reduced regulatory management structure for certain widely-generated
hazardous wastes currently subject to full RCRA Subtitle C regulation, in an effort to facilitate their collection
and proper management (the ``universal wastes'' proposal, 58 FR 8102). The proposed reduced regulatory structure,
known as a special collection system, is designed to ensure that management of these hazardous wastes is conducted
in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment, given the diffuse and diverse population of generators
of these wastes. See the February 11, 1993 preamble discussion, for a detailed discussion of the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general waste types that EPA believes may be appropriately managed under this streamlined regulatory structure
are known as ``universal wastes'' and share several characteristics. These wastes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are frequently generated in a wide variety of settings other than the industrial settings usually associated
with hazardous wastes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are generated by a vast community, the size of which poses implementation difficulties for both those who are
regulated and the regulatory agencies charged with implementing the hazardous waste program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;May be present in significant volumes in the municipal waste stream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The February 11, 1993, proposal included specific regulatory text addressing the management of two waste types;
hazardous waste batteries, and suspended and/or canceled hazardous waste pesticides that are recalled. The proposal
also included a petition process and a set of criteria to be used to determine whether it would be appropriate to add
additional waste types to the special collection system in the future. Several waste types such as automotive antifreeze,
paint application wastes, and mercury-containing items such as thermostats and thermometers were discussed as
possible additions to the Universal Waste proposal, also referred to as the special collection system.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Universal Waste System Alternative for Lamps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the February 11, 1993, proposal EPA mentioned fluorescent lamps (58 FR 8110), explaining that the Agency was examining
the risks of managing these wastes in landfills and requesting data on the risks of various management methods for
these wastes. Comments received in response to that request are included in the docket for this proposal. The Agency
will respond to these comments in the final rule together with those submitted in response to Today's proposal. The
Agency is requesting comment on using the proposed special collection system for the management of spent lamps as
another approach to the management of mercury-containing lamps. The Agency has not yet promulgated a final universal
waste rule but anticipates doing so in the near future. Should EPA select the universal waste option for lamps as a final
rule, the Agency will ensure consistency with the more comprehensive universal waste final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that spent lamps may appropriately be considered ``universal wastes'' in that they are generated
in a wide variety of settings, are generated by a very large number of generators, and are present in significant volumes
in the municipal waste stream. The special collection system approach may be an appropriate option for addressing
the collection phase of managing lamps that are hazardous waste. The special collection system approach (which is
consistent with the February 11, 1993 proposal), would not change any of the requirements applicable to the ultimate
treatment and disposal or recycling of any wastes collected, but would minimize the regulatory requirements applicable
to collection of these wastes (i.e., generation, transportation, and intermediate storage/consolidation) for
proper management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special collection system regulations also could remove some existing barriers to management of hazardous waste
lamps under the Subtitle C system by reducing the technical and paperwork requirements applicable to collection,
thus making collection more efficient and economical. At the same time, management requirements included in special
collection system regulations could be designed to minimize the hazards posed in collection of these wastes (e.g.,
special packaging could be required to minimize the risk of breakage).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By removing some of the barriers to Subtitle C management for lamps, a special collection system approach could minimize
concerns about decreased participation in the Green Lights program by simplifying and clarifying the requirements
for mercury-containing lamp collection while maintaining Subtitle C control over final treatment and disposal
(or recycling) for these lamps. Such an approach could help in assuring that the substantial environmental benefits
offered by the Green Lights program are realized through increased participation. Management costs under the special
collection system approach proposed on February 11, 1993, would be lower than full Subtitle C management because
hazardous waste transporters and manifests would not be required for lamp shipments between the generator and the
consolidation facility, and permits would not be required for storage at interim consolidation points. However,
under the Special Collection System the management of mercury-containing lamps (after reaching the consolidation
point) would be more expensive than the management of these lamps under the conditional exclusion (although the larger
volumes managed at these consolidation points may result in certain economies of scale for transport and disposal
or recycling). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comment on whether spent hazardous waste lamps should be regulated under the special collection
system approach proposed February 11, 1993. Documents included in the docket for this proposal include estimates
indicating that approximately 3.9 billion spent lamps of all types may be disposed of annually in the country (including
550 million spent fluorescent lamps) and that lighting is one of the second largest contributors of mercury to the
municipal waste stream (from all types of mercury-containing lamps). In addition, the Agency believes that spent
mercury-containing lamps of some type must be generated by almost every commercial and industrial establishment
in the country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a special collection system approach could address all types of spent lamps that fail the toxicity characteristic
and are therefore hazardous waste, not only mercury-containing lamps. Such an approach seems appropriate since
any type of waste lamp is likely to be ``universal'' in nature. The Agency requests comment on whether various types
of spent lamps (e.g., incandescent, neon), other than mercury-containing lamps, typically fail the TC test (or exhibit
other characteristics) and would be hazardous waste under the current RCRA Subtitle C toxicity characteristic (40
CFR 261.24). Indeed, should the Agency choose, in a final rule, to conditionally exempt mercury-containing lamps
from regulation under Subtitle C, the Agency may still elect to add other types of lamps to the universal waste management
system. The Agency requests comment on this approach and on whether, how frequently, and for what TC constituents
various lamp types may fail the toxicity characteristic. The Agency also requests that commenters submit any additional
data that may be available on this question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comment on a special collection system for management of spent lamps including the same basic
structure and requirements for generators, transporters, consolidation points, and destination facilities as
proposed on February 11, 1993 for management of hazardous waste batteries and pesticides. The Agency is also specifically
requesting comment on the items discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, in the February 11, 1993, proposal the Agency proposed a quantity limit for storage of batteries above which
generators and consolidation points would be required to notify the Agency of their storage activities. The Agency
requests comment on a notification requirement for generators and consolidation points storing more than 35,000
spent mercury-containing lamps. This requirement is similar in substance to the notification requirement proposed
in the Universal Wastes rule (proposed &sect;273.11(c) and &sect;273.13(d) (58 FR 8129&hyph;8130)). EPA is suggesting
a numerical limit rather than a weight limit because lamp packaging (e.g., the cardboard boxes in which new replacement
lamps were shipped) may constitute a large proportion of the total weight of a shipment or stored quantity of lamps.
In addition, industry practice appears to be to quantify inventories by number of lamps rather than by weight, calculated
by multiplying the number of boxes of lamps in storage or in a shipment by the number of lamps per box. Since about 35,000
lamps roughly correspond to a full truckload of packaged fluorescent lamps, the Agency is suggesting a 35,000 limit
for fluorescent lamps. The Agency also requests comment on appropriate quantity limits for notification for other
hazardous waste lamps types.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the Agency is requesting comment on the options proposed in the Universal Waste proposal &sect;273.11(b)(2)
and &sect;273.13(a)(2) (58 FR 8129&hyph;8130) for demonstrating that lamps are not stored for greater than one year.
In addition, with respect to tracking of lamp shipments, the Agency is requesting comment on several alternatives.
The approach included in today's proposed regulatory text is the same as that included in the universal wastes proposal
for batteries (&sect;273.12(b) of the universal waste proposal). This approach requires that the manifest system
be used (which triggers the use of hazardous waste transporters) for shipments from the last consolidation point
to a destination facility, but that no manifests or other records (or hazardous waste transporters) be required for
shipments from generators to consolidation points, between consolidation points, or from generators to destination
facilities. On the other hand, because a number of comments received on the proposed universal wastes rule disagreed
with this approach, the Agency is also requesting comment on two additional approaches. The first alternative, which
was suggested in several comments on the universal wastes rule, would be to require that persons initiating and receiving
shipments of lamps retain shipping papers documenting the shipments. The minimum data elements required for such
records could be specified (e.g., quantity of lamps, date of shipment or receipt, name and address of shipper and receiver).
The second alternative would be not to specifically require any specific record keeping for shipments of lamps, but,
as with all exemptions, the person claiming the exemption would have to keep documentation to show they qualify (see
&sect;261.2(f)). The Agency is requesting comment on this second alternative because it is believed that due to the
large volumes of lamps, shipments are more likely to be made directly from the generator to a destination facility.
Records would be available for such shipments because destination facilities are already required under 40 CFR 264.73(b)(1)
or 265.73(b)(1) to maintain records including the description and quantity of each hazardous waste received. It
is likely that lamps would be shipped directly from generators to disposal facilities because volumes are likely
to be large enough that consolidation will not be necessary to make full truckloads. In addition, the storage space
and careful handling required for management of these wastes make consolidation less attractive and shipment directly
to the destination facility more likely.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third question on which the Agency requests comment is what management controls would be appropriate to impose on
collection of lamps under a special collection system approach. Some of the data included in the docket for this proposal
discuss the risks of the types of management likely in lamp collection such as management at the generator's site,
transportation, and storage (U.S. EPA, 1993a). Requirements could include packaging that would be required to meet
a performance standard of minimizing breakage for unbroken spent lamps. A wide variety of containers would probably
satisfy such packaging requirements. EPA expects that packaging in which new replacement lamps are shipped from
the manufacturer would frequently be reused to store and transport removed, used lamps. Another option could be to
impose a prohibition on intentional breakage of spent lamps by generators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, requirements could be imposed on the storage and transportation of spent lamps that are inadvertently
broken, to prevent further mercury emissions. Steel 55-gallon drums or any enclosed container could be used to hold
broken lamps for transportation to the disposal site. In summary, the Agency requests comment on whether the exclusion
should include requirements to minimize mercury emissions during storage and transportation of spent lamps. Management
standards would apply to transporter and consolidation points as well as for generators. The Agency requests comment
on management practices for lamps, the risks posed by these practices, and appropriate technical controls to minimize
these risks while at the same time not inhibiting collection and proper management. The Agency also requests comment
on whether generators or consolidation points should be allowed to intentionally crush lamps to minimize volume
for storage or shipment and what, if any, standards should be imposed to protect against mercury releases during crushing
or the subsequent management of crushed lamps. The proposed universal waste management system includes a prohibition
on treatment (crushing is considered treatment) of lamps at the generator, transporter and consolidation points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fourth question on which the Agency requests comment is whether to include a 3 to 5 year sunset provision on the universal
waste system for lamps. A sunset provision will require EPA to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the universal waste
system in addressing the disposal of lamps after 3 to 5 years. The Agency can then decide whether less controls or more
controls are needed to maintain the safe management of lamps and whether to extend the inclusion of lamps in the universal
waste system.

A. Applicability of Rules in Authorized States
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administer and enforce the RCRA program with the
State. (See 40 CFR part 271 for the standards and requirements for authorization.) Following authorization, EPA
retains enforcement authority under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, although authorized States have primary
enforcement responsibility. The standards and requirements for authorization are found at 40 CFR part 271.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, a State with final authorization administered its
hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in that State. The Federal requirements
no longer applied in the authorized State and EPA could not issue permits for any facility in the State that the State
was authorized to permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgated or enacted, the State was
obliged to enact equivalent authority within specified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect
in an authorized State until the authorized State adopted the requirements as State law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirements and prohibitions imposed by the HSWA
take effect in authorized States at the same time that they take effect in non-authorized States. EPA is directed to
implement HSWA requirements and prohibitions in an authorized State, including the issuance of permits, until the
State is granted authorization to do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as State law to retain
final authorization, HSWA applies in authorized States in the interim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Effect on State Authorizations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conditional exclusion and the universal waste management system would not be HSWA regulations, and thus would
not be immediately effective in authorized States. Thus, the exemption would be applicable only in those States that
do not have final authorization for the base (non-HSWA) portion of the RCRA program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3009 of RCRA allows States to impose more stringent regulations than the Federal program. Accordingly, authorized
States are only required to modify their programs when EPA promulgates Federal regulations that are more stringent
than the authorized State regulations. For those changes that are less stringent or reduce the scope of the Federal
program, States are not required to modify their programs. Today's proposed options are considered less stringent
or smaller in scope than the existing Federal regulations because that portion of today's proposal would exempt certain
activities now within the purview of RCRA Subtitle C. Therefore, authorized States are not required to modify their
programs to adopt regulations consistent with and equivalent to the proposed exclusion or the proposed universal
waste management system for lamps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though States will not be required to adopt today's proposed options (if either is finalized), EPA would encourage
States to do so. As already explained in the preamble, a conditional exclusion of mercury-containing lamps or the
addition of lamps to the universal waste management system could reduce barriers to participation in EPA's Green
Lights program, which encourages pollution prevention through energy savings. Further, it could help to clarify
for the regulated community the proper management of mercury-containing lamps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed options, by making regulations less stringent for management of lamps, would give States
more freedom to develop programs for lamp disposal that would be appropriate for their situation.

VII. Economic Impact Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order No. 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order
defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect
on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;
(2) create serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the
principles set forth in the Executive Order.

Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, this section of the preamble summarizes the costs (savings) and the
economic impact analysis of (option 1) the proposed mercury-containing lamp exclusion and of (option 2) the proposed
special collection of mercury-containing lamps. Based upon the economic impact analysis for today's rule, the Agency's
best estimate is that the exclusion of mercury-containing lamps from Subtitle C hazardous waste regulatory requirements
(option 1) may result in nationwide annualized savings of approximately $93 million, and the special collection
of mercury containing lamps (option 2) may result in a nationwide annualized savings of approximately $17 million.
A complete discussion of the economic impact analysis is available in the regulatory docket for today's proposed
rule (EPA, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests information to better evaluate the human health and environmental effects of the two options
described in this notice and current disposal practices. Human and environmental exposure to mercury could occur
during the collection, transportation, processing, recycling, treatment, and disposal of spent lamps. EPA estimated
the potential mercury air emissions resulting from some of these activities, but is uncertain about the extent and
likelihood of human and environmental exposure. The Agency is also aware that the two regulatory options may pose
different worker and transportation injury risks as well as different environmental risks. The Agency requests
information on the overall risks to human health and the environment associated with current practices and the two
proposed options.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section briefly describes (1) the universe of spent mercury-containing lamps and lamp generators, (2) the current
regulatory baseline and (3) the major options for the regulation of spent mercury-containing lamps included in today's
proposal for consideration. Descriptions of the baseline and the major options also include a summary of the methodology
used in estimating compliance costs (savings). Results of the analysis are summarized in section 5.

1. Universe of Spent Lamps and Spent Lamp Generators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency estimates that approximately 310 to 380 million mercury-containing lamps, and 47,000 to 64,000 facilities
could be affected annually by today's proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The spent lamp generation number is based on sales data,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 adjusted to account for (1) Lamps generated by Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators (CESQG), which would
not be affected by either one of the proposed options, and (2) lamps generated in States where spent bulb management
regulations exist (California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin). (It was assumed that these State controls would be more
stringent than the options considered in today's proposal and would therefore supersede any Federal exemption of
spent mercury-containing lamps from Subtitle C requirements).

2. Baseline Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA assumed that baseline requirements are the continuation of current Subtitle C regulatory standards for the treatment
and disposal of mercury-containing lamps which currently fail the TC. Under this scenario, generators of spent mercury
containing lamps which fail the TC continue to be subject to the full spectrum of hazardous waste management standards
including record keeping and manifesting of all mercury-containing lamp shipments, Agency notification and Subtitle
C transport, treatment, storage and disposal standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the cost analysis, all spent mercury-containing lamps were assumed to be TC (Toxicity Characteristic) hazardous
wastes. All spent lamps were also assumed to be in the low risk category for mercury, requiring stabilization as treatment
under the Land Disposal Restrictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cost drivers for the baseline management of spent lamps include hazardous waste transportation, and Subtitle C disposal.
The bulk of mercury-containing lamps currently disposed (97%) are assumed to be stabilized and disposed of in hazardous
waste landfills. The remainder, based upon volume data from the spent mercury-containing lamp recovery industry,
are recycled. Based upon conversations with the recycling industry, which indicate planned increases in recycling
capacity, the analysis assumed a small annual increase in the baseline recycling rate of mercury-containing lamps
over the first three years of the analysis. Unit costs for stabilization, landfilling, recycling and hazardous waste
transport were applied on a per ton basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generator specific requirements which applied to all large quantity generators of spent mercury-containing lamps
included record-keeping, manifesting, exception reporting, and BRS (Biennial Reporting System) reporting. Other
generator requirements, including rule familiarization, notification, personnel safety training and emergency
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 planning were only assessed for new facilities which spot relamp and store (up to 90 days for large quantity generators;
up to 180 days for small quantity generators) spent lamps on site. It is assumed that costs resulting from generator
requirements which are incurred on a per shipment basis (i.e. manifesting, exception reporting) will be incurred
by group relampers once every three years (once per relamp). Spot relampers will incur these costs twice a year (for
small quantity generators) or four times per year (for large quantity generators).

According to 40 CFR part 265 Subpart D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, all large quantity generators
of hazardous waste must draft a contingency plan describing the actions facility personnel will take should a fire,
explosion, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden releases of hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface
water occur. Local emergency response teams use the information required in the contingency plan to minimize unanticipated
damage from the storage of hazardous waste.

3. Option 1: Conditional Exclusion From Subtitle C Standards Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first option under consideration in today's proposal is to exclude mercury-containing lamps from Subtitle C
management standards with the condition that these lamps are managed in permitted municipal landfills or recycling
facilities. The proposed exclusion also includes a minor generator record keeping requirement. As the exclusion
would be deregulatory, primary economic impacts to small and large quantity generators of mercury-containing lamps
resulting from this action would be in the form of cost savings from avoided Subtitle C regulatory management, particularly
for transport and disposal of spent lamps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the cost analysis, it was assumed that, given the proposed conditional exclusion, all small and large quantity
generators of spent mercury-containing lamps would opt for management in municipal landfills in order to reduce
disposal costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some generators may have slightly higher disposal costs than others as a result of the proposed exclusion of mercury-containing
lamps from municipal combustors. If these generators currently manage their non-hazardous waste in municipal combustors,
the combustor exclusion may require these generators to: (1) Keep their spent lamps separate from the rest of their
municipal solid waste, (2) store spent lamps on site until enough volume has been generated to make disposal cost effective,
and (3) haul spent lamps greater distances to municipal solid waste landfills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, overall savings to be accrued from the proposed exclusion may vary slightly from generator to generator.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Option 2: Special Collection Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second option, special collection, included in today's proposal would allow small and large quantity generators
of spent mercury-containing lamps to reduce certain administrative activities required under Subtitle C standards,
including biennial reporting, notification, manifesting and personnel training. Additionally the option also
allows generators to store spent mercury-containing lamps on-site for up to one year without a hazardous waste permit,
and to transport their spent lamps direct to final disposal or recycling using non-hazardous waste haulers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The option also includes similar reduced requirements for interim spent lamp storage facilities and ``special collection
centers.'' Transportation to these facilities or centers from the generator would not be regulated under Subtitle
C standards, however, transport to final disposal or recycling from these facilities would be regulated under Subtitle
C standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs estimated for Special Collection Option assumes for urban generators direct shipment using non-hazardous
waste haulers, as allowed under this option, from generators to final disposal; thus the costs of creating and operating
an interim storage facility or special collection center are not included for urban generators. The rationale for
this omission is twofold: (1) It is assumed that spent lamp generation is large enough to create economies of scale
for direct non-hazardous waste transport; the need for special collection centers is precluded by non-hazardous
waste transport ``milk runs'' for spent lamps, and (2) although there may be economies of scale generated for long-haul
transport of spent lamps from collection centers, the special collection option requires Subtitle C transport from
the centers to final disposal or recycling, thus making the use of a collection center with Subtitle C final transport
more expensive than Subtitle D direct transport to the disposal facility.

National Annualized Costs (Savings).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A summary of estimated national annual compliance costs associated with the exclusion option and the special collection
option, along with estimated baseline compliance costs are presented below in exhibit VII.1. Also presented are
estimated incremental savings above baseline compliance costs for each option. Costs were annualized over a twenty-year
period, using a 7% discount rate. The analysis used projected growth in the U.S. population over the twenty-year time
frame of the analysis to estimate the increase in growth of spent lamp generation. Total estimated annualized savings
range between approximately $85 million and $102 million for the exclusion and savings estimates for the special
collection option range between $16 million and $20 million in savings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above savings estimate is based on the assumption in the baseline that all facilities are properly managing their
mercury-containing spent lamps as Subtitle C waste. Currently, however, some lamp generators may not be aware that
fluorescent lamps are hazardous waste and therefore may not be following Subtitle C requirements. Hence, estimated
savings may represent savings from a future scenario of full compliance with current law, rather than savings from
current lamp management. EPA expects that if no regulatory action is taken, Subtitle C management of mercury-containing
lamps will become more prevalent over the next few years.

Savings Per Waste Lamp Generated.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As with average savings per generator estimates, average savings per waste lamp generated were derived by simply
dividing total upper and lower bound costs (savings) by the estimated number of waste lamps accounted for by small
and large quantity generators in states without specific spent lamp management standards. The average baseline
Subtitle C cost per bulb is estimated to be $.34 to $.36. The resulting savings per lamp is estimated at $.27 per bulb
for the conditional exclusion option (both high and low savings scenario) and at $.05 per bulb for the special collection
option. Again, cost per bulb may vary significantly due to site specific factors.

6. Sensitivity Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section presents the results of EPA's analysis of the effects of varying selected major parameters in the cost
analysis (where the Agency used considerable judgment in arriving at the parameter's value) on the estimated savings
incurred under the proposed conditional exclusion and the proposed Universal Waste Rule. The following assumptions
were analyzed in the sensitivity analysis for EPA's analysis of spent lamp management costs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) Percentage of Lamps Generated at Small and Large Quantity Generators.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the sensitivity analysis, EPA set its lower bound estimates of the percentage of lamps generated at SQGs and LQGs
at fifty percent of total spent lamp generation and its upper bound estimates at ninety percent. (Seventy-five percent
was used in the initial cost analysis).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) Cost to Transport Subtitle C Waste.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the sensitivity analysis, EPA increased the upper bound estimates of the costs of transporting spent lamps as Subtitle
C by a factor of three, based on price quotes from commercial transporters, over original estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(3) Cost to Dispose of Subtitle C Waste.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Based on price quotes from commercial hazardous waste disposal facilities, EPA increased the upper bound estimates
of the Subtitle C disposal costs by a factor of four over original estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(4) Cost of Employee Training.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To reflect uncertainty over whether a professional trainer would be required and over how many employees would need
to be trained, EPA increased and decreased the cost of employee training required by 50 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with the high-end scenario were estimated using the upper bound estimates for each cost element
included in the sensitivity analysis. The costs associated with the low-end scenario combined the lower bound estimates
for each cost element. The results from these two analyses suggest that the range of total annual savings from the proposed
condition exclusion for spent lamps could be $65 million to $289 million, and the range of total annual savings from
the proposed Universal Waste RCRA requirements for generators of spent lamps could be $15 million to $39 million.
The range in cost savings is mainly the result of uncertainty over Subtitle C transportation and disposal costs for
lamps. Although EPA has received price quotes for management of lamps as Subtitle C waste that are considerably higher
than the average cost of managing hazardous waste in Subtitle C landfills, it is not appropriate to directly compare
price quotes to engineering costs because the price quotes reflect a constrained market place which tends to inflate
prices well above costs. However, a three-fold difference between the price quotes for spent lamps and standard Subtitle
C management cost may also be due to other factors beyond the inflated prices of the constrained market, including
the low density of lamps (i.e. a ton of lamps has a greater volume than a ton of hazardous waste sludge), or difficulty
in handling lamps. EPA requests comment on the true costs, as well as the reasoning behind these costs, of managing
spent lamps as Subtitle C waste.

B. Proposed Rule Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Impacts on Generators of Mercury-Containing Waste Lamps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated above, option 1, the exclusion, is estimated to result in average annual savings per small and large quantity
spent lamp generator ranging from $2,000 to $2,250. Option 2, special collection, is estimated to result in an average
annual per generator savings of approximately $300. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Secondary Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While total incremental savings from the proposed exclusion (option 1) and from the proposed special collection
system (option 2) over a Subtitle C management approach appear to be high, the Agency does not expect significant immediate
shifts in demand or price for the lamps or for products manufactured or sold by firms which consume these lamps due to
the proposed options. Because the impacts to lamp generators are positive (i.e. net savings), the Agency does not
expect the rule to result in adverse impacts to businesses, or to affect employment or international trade to any appreciable
degree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that, with the exception of lamps generated in States with existing lamp disposal requirements, most
small and large quantity generators of mercury containing lamps will choose to dispose of their waste lamps in municipal
solid waste landfills under option 1, the proposed exclusion from Subtitle C. This is because Subtitle D disposal
is significantly less expensive per bulb than recycling or Subtitle C disposal.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Subsequently, most waste lamps currently being handled according to Subtitle C standards by permitted hazardous
waste haulers, disposal sites and spent lamp processing facilities, would be handled by Subtitle D haulers and disposal
facilities. Thus Subtitle C waste haulers, disposal and spent lamp processing facilities would be affected negatively
while Subtitle D haulers and disposal facilities would be affected positively under option 1.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA estimates that the average cost per ton for Subtitle D disposal is $35 as compared to $400 per ton for Subtitle C disposal
and $1,375 per ton for recycling.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The exclusion, option 1, may also have an impact upon mercury-containing lamp processors. The Agency estimates that
there are currently 15 facilities which process spent mercury-containing lamps. Two of these facilities recover
spent mercury through retorting; the remaining 13 facilities separate the glass and aluminum ends, and send the mercury-containing
phosphor powder to the two facilities that retort. Ten of the 15 lamp processing facilities are located in the three
States where spent lamp management regulations exist. Although most recovery facilities are located in States with
stringent State lamp disposal requirements, and would most likely will not be affected by today's proposed exclusion,
a certain percentage of the spent lamps currently recovered at these facilities are generated in States with no specific
lamp disposal requirements. EPA believes that a portion of mercury-containing lamps would no longer be sent for recovery
under the proposed exclusion (option 1) since disposal in municipal landfills would be significantly less expensive.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Assuming that lamps generated outside of these States will not be sent for recovery, it is possible that 17 percent,
or 16 million lamps, may be diverted. Using a lamp/revenue ratio for recovery facilities of $.44, total impact to the
industry could be approximately $7 million dollars
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in lost revenues ($469,000 per facility). Future recycling efforts may also be impacted since many of these facilities
may retract plans for expansion in States which currently have no specific lamp disposal requirements.

EPA estimates that Subtitle D landfilling costs range between $10 and $150 per ton depending upon the region of the
country. Compared with an average recycling cost of $1375 per ton, Subtitle D landfilling is significantly less expensive.

Under option 2, the proposed special collection system, small and large quantity generators would not be allowed
to choose to dispose of hazardous waste lamps in a municipal solid waste landfill. Thus the above impacts on Subtitle
C waste haulers, disposal and spent lamp processing facilities would not be observed under the second option.

X. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires Federal agencies to consider ``small entities'' throughout
the regulatory process. Section 603 of the RFA requires an initial screening analysis to be performed to determine
whether small entities will be affected by the regulation. If affected small entities are identified, regulatory
alternatives must be considered to mitigate the potential impacts. Small entities as described in the Act are only
those ``businesses, organizations and governmental jurisdictions subject to regulation.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only entities directly subject to today's proposed rule are small and large quantity generators of spent mercury
containing lamps (conditionally exempt small quantity generators are not directly subject to today's proposed
rule). In order to meet the definition of a regulated entity under today's rule, a generator must produce over 100 kg
of spent lamps (350 four foot fluorescent lamps) in a given month. It is conceivable that some of these generators would
meet the definition of ``small business'' as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (i.e. mid-sized firms that
group relamp and generate in excess of 346 spent fluorescent lamps in a given month); however the Agency does not have
an estimate of the number of such ``small entities.'' However, both of the proposed options are expected to result
in net savings to the regulated entities. Option 1, excluding mercury containing lamps from Subtitle C management
standards, is estimated to result in per generator savings of between $2,000 and $2,250 annually. Option 2, managing
spent lamps under a special collection system is estimated to result in an average annual per generator savings of
approximately $300. Thus, since generator impacts are positive for both options, EPA has determined that small regulated
entities will not be adversely impacted, and thus, no ``mitigating'' options are being analyzed in this section.
Hence, pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), ``the Administrator certifies
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of entities.''

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under its appropriation for fiscal year (FY) 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389), FEMA was authorized to assess and collect
fees from Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees to recover approximately, but not less than, 100 per centum
of the amounts anticipated by FEMA to be obligated for its Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) program. This
appropriations act further provided for the Director of FEMA to promulgate, through rulemaking, a schedule of fees
applicable to persons subject to FEMA's radiological emergency preparedness regulations. Public Law 102&hyph;389
provided the authority for these user fees to be assessed and collected for fiscal year 1993 services only. FEMA's
appropriation for FY 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124) continued the user fee provisions of Public Law 102&hyph;389, and
FEMA anticipates that the Congress will provide such authority again in FEMA's appropriation for FY 1995. If such
authority is provided, FEMA proposes to revise its existing interim rule to change for FY 1995 the methodology used
to assess the user fees. One advantage of the proposed change in methodology would be the ability to issue user fee bills
during the first quarter of the fiscal year. This proposed rule is being published at this time in order to publish the
resulting revised rule in time to meet the FY 1995 billing schedule, as well as to notify all potentially affected parties
of this proposed change and to invite and request comments on the proposed revised methodology.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 6, 1991, FEMA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 9452&hyph;9459) the final rule, 44 CFR part 353, that established a structure for assessing and collecting
user fees from NRC licensees. Under 44 CFR part 353, REP services provided by FEMA personnel and FEMA contractors were
reimbursable only if these services were site-specific in nature and directly contributed to the fulfillment of
emergency preparedness requirements needed for licensing by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
Although FEMA is proposing a new approach for the assessment and collection of fees from licensees for FY 1995, part
353 remains in effect and will apply in any subsequent fiscal year for which FEMA is not authorized to collect user fees
for generic services.

Public Law 102&hyph;389, October 6, 1992, 106 Stat. 1571&hyph;1619, expanded reimbursable REP Program activities
by authorizing FEMA to charge licensees of commercial nuclear power plants fees to recover the full amount of the funds
budgeted for FEMA's REP Program for FY 1993. On July 1, 1993, FEMA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 35770&hyph;35775) an interim rule, 44 CFR part 354, to establish and set forth the policies and administrative
basis for assessing and collecting these fees. FEMA reserved the option of applying, reissuing, or amending part
354 for other fiscal years provided that appropriate authority was enacted. Public Law 103&hyph;124, September
23, 1993, 107 Stat. 1297, directed FEMA to continue assessing and collecting fees to recover the full amount of the
funds budgeted for FEMA's REP Program for FY 1994. In addition, the Administration has proposed assessing such fees
for subsequent fiscal years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using the methodology established by the interim rule, 44 CFR part 354, the final hourly user fee rate for FEMA personnel
during FY 1993 was calculated at $122.88. On December 13, 1993, a notice to this effect was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 65274). The notice also explained that FEMA would not publish a final rule at that time, pending a reconsideration
of the methodology used for FY 1993, taking into consideration the comments received on interim rule 44 CFR part 354.
The methodology established by the interim rule 44 CFR part 354 was continued in effect for FY 1994 as noticed in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 26350) published on May 19, 1994. Although the revised interim rule would, if authorized by FEMA's FY 1995 appropriation,
be restricted to FY 1995, FEMA reserves the option of reissuing or amending part 354 for other fiscal years provided
that appropriate authority is enacted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposed revision of 44 CFR part 354, fees for FY 1995 would be assessed at a flat rate based on fiscal year
budgeted funds for REP Program services performed by FEMA personnel and FEMA contractors whether or not these services
directly support NRC licensing requirements. Under Section 354.4, Assessment of Fees, charges for services would
be determined by dividing the total amount of funds budgeted for the REP Program, i.e., salaries and expenses, including
travel, and Emergency Management Planning and Assistance (EMPA) funding, by the total number of licensed commercial
nuclear power plant sites benefiting from REP Program services, as defined under &sect;354.2, Scope. The total amount
of funds budgeted for the REP Program would be recovered by dividing the funds equally among the NRC licensees on a per
site basis; thus, all sites will be charged the same flat fee. Under this methodology, site-specific and generic services
would not be distinguished.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the comments in response to interim rule 44 CFR part 354 considered by FEMA were those submitted by the Nuclear
Management and Resources Council (NUMARC), which has now become part of the Nuclear Energy Institute. In its comments,
NUMARC recommended a methodology whereby the hourly rate for FEMA personnel would be determined by dividing that
percentage of the total FEMA Salaries and Expenses budget item attributable to site-specific activities by the total
number of site-specific hours expended. This hourly rate then would be applied only to site-specific activities
performed by FEMA personnel. Site-specific activities performed by contractor personnel would be billed on an actual
cost basis. Finally, under the proposed NUMARC methodology, costs for generic services provided by FEMA personnel
and FEMA contract personnel would be recovered by charging each licensee equally for these activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The methodology recommended by NUMARC was considered by FEMA, but the flat fee approach is being proposed instead
because a flat fee would: (1) Provide each licensee with a bill early in the fiscal year, thus facilitating the licensee's
planning and budgeting process by greatly increasing the predictability of the licensee's bill; (2) enable States
and licensees to request needed technical assistance without considering any cost implications associated with
site-specific oriented methodologies; (3) benefit the U.S. taxpayer by earlier deposit of funds in the U.S. Treasury;
and (4) reduce the FEMA resources required to track administrative costs, thus making the accounting and billing
process more efficient and cost-effective for the Government and freeing up FEMA resources for other REP program
activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the above considerations, FEMA used actual FY 1993 billing data to calculate a flat fee and compared
this with the fees that would have been generated using the methodology proposed by NUMARC. Using FY 1993 data, the
flat fee (for each site) would have been $149,928. Under the proposed NUMARC methodology, the generic portion of the
bill alone for each site would have been $87,702. The site-specific portion, consisting of exercise, plan review,
and other site-specific activities, would be added to this amount for the total bill.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A further comparison of the results of these calculations indicated that, under the proposed NUMARC methodology,
23 sites would have had bills equal to or higher than the flat fee, averaging approximately $90,000 more than the flat
fee. Forty-seven sites would have had bills lower than the flat fee, averaging approximately $42,000 less than the
flat fee. An analysis of the results using the proposed NUMARC methodology also indicated that the size of a site's
bill was, in most instances, directly related to the biennial exercise cycle; i.e., the bill was higher if a site had
an exercise in FY 1993, and the bill was lower if a site had not had an exercise in FY 1993. Thus, a majority of the bills
below the flat fee in FY 1993 would be higher than the flat fee in FY 1994, and vice versa. Over a two-year period the bills
would average out to an amount reasonably close to the flat fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the results of the above calculations, FEMA believes the flat fee to be fair and equitable because (1) although
under the proposed NUMARC methodology, more bills were below the flat fee than were above it, those bills lower than
the flat fee were, on the average, considerably closer to the flat fee than were the bills higher than the flat fee, and
(2) the flat fee would eliminate the extreme year-to-year fluctuation in bill amount due to a site's position in the
exercise cycle, and, thus, each site's bills would be more equitable in size over any given biennial cycle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FEMA's services primarily are provided in support of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the NRC and FEMA
published on September 14, 1993 (58 FR 47996), and regulations issued by both FEMA (44 CFR parts 350, 351, and 352) and
the NRC (10 CFR parts 50 and 52).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Radiological emergency response plans and exercises are evaluated using joint FEMA&hyph;NRC criteria, NUREG&hyph;0654/FEMA&hyph;REP&hyph;1,
Revision 1 and Supplement 1. When State and local governments do not participate in the development of an emergency
plan, the licensee may submit a licensee offsite plan to the NRC. Pursuant to the MOU, the NRC can request that FEMA review
a licensee offsite plan and provide its assessments and findings on the adequacy of such plans and preparedness evaluated
under Supplement 1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All funds collected under this proposed rule would be deposited in the U.S. Treasury to offset funds budgeted for FEMA's
REP Program. In response to a FEMA request for a waiver from the Department of Treasury's cash management provisions
of the Treasury Financial Manual (TFM), I&hyph;TFM 6&hyph;8000, Section 8025.10, the Department of the Treasury
granted FEMA a waiver from the I&hyph;TFM 6&hyph;8000, Section 8025.10, requirement to bill within five days of service.
A waiver was not granted to allow 45 days for payment of bills by licensees. However, if the authority for the proposed
revised interim rule is enacted, the Department of the Treasury will grant a one-time exemption to the 30 day payment
requirement in order to permit licensees to pay the FY 1995 bill, which would be issued in November 1994, in January
of 1995. Also, the Department of the Treasury requested that the user fee rule provide for the use of electronic billing
and payment mechanisms. FEMA worked with the Department of the Treasury to effect these procedures and now provides
for payment of bills by electronic transfers through Automated Clearing House credit payments. The Department of
the Treasury publication I&hyph;TFM 6&hyph;8000 has been recently revised to require, under section 8025.30, all
funds to be collected by electronic funds transfer when such collection would be cost-effective, practicable, and
consistent with current statutory authority.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This part establishes the methodology for FEMA to assess and collect user fees from Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) licensees of commercial nuclear power plants to recover at least 100 percent of the cost of services provided
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) through its Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) Program
as authorized under Title

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [Authority citation to be inserted if enacted], the methodology for assessment and collection of fees shall be fair
and equitable, and shall reflect the full amount of costs of providing radiological emergency planning, preparedness,
response and associated services. Such fees will be assessed in a manner that reflects the use of agency resources
for classes of regulated persons and the administrative costs of collecting such fees. Fees received pursuant to
this section shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury as offsetting receipts. Assessment and collection
of such fees are only authorized during fiscal year (FY) 1995.

Assessment of fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assessment of fees for licensees will be based on the following methodology that includes, but does not distinguish
between, charges for both site-specific and generic services provided by FEMA personnel and FEMA contractors. Fees
will be assessed for REP Program services provided by FEMA personnel and by FEMA contractors and not for those services
provided by other Federal agencies involved in the FRPCC or the RACs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination of charges for services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Charges for services will be determined by dividing the total amount of fiscal year funds budgeted for the REP Program,
i.e., salaries and expenses, including travel, and Emergency Management Planning and Assistance (EMPA) funding,
by the total number of commercial nuclear power plant sites, as defined under &sect;354.2, Scope. The total amount
of funds budgeted for the REP Program will be recovered by dividing the funds equally among the NRC licensees on a per
commercial nuclear power plant site basis; thus, all sites would be charged the same amount. Under this methodology,
site specific and generic services will not be distinguished.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discontinuation of Charges. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon receipt of official written notification from the NRC that offsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness
is no longer required at a particular commercial nuclear power plant site, FEMA will discontinue REP Program services
and will close out the official docket. Commencing with the next fiscal year after closing out the official docket,
user fees will no longer be assessed for that site.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FEMA will forward bills to licensees based on the assessment methodology set forth in &sect;354.4 to recover the full
amount of the funds budgeted by FEMA to provide REP Program services. The assessments for each site and licensee, as
stated above, will not distinguish between site-specific and generic services provided by FEMA personnel and FEMA
contractors. Licensees with multiple sites will receive consolidated bills. FEMA will forward one bill to each licensee
during the first quarter of the fiscal year, with payment due within 30 days. There will be a one-time adjustment to
the billing cycle in the first quarter of FY 1995 to accommodate a transition to the new methodology. During this quarter,
an adjusted final bill for FY 1994 REP Program services will be issued along with the bill for all of FY 1995, with a possible
second bill if minor adjustments are necessary. In order to avoid having the licensees pay two bills during the same
fiscal year (FY 1994) for activities performed in two different fiscal years, FEMA, with the concurrence of the Department
of the Treasury, will structure the due date of these two bills so that the adjusted bill for FY 1994 will be due and payable
by the end of December 1994 and the full bill for FY 1995 will be due and payable in January of 1995.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule updates the regulations of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled
to reflect developments and changes in Committee procedures which have occurred since the regulations were last
substantively revised in 1991, and to include wording changes that were overlooked in that revision. The new revisions
were made necessary by changes in the Government procurement process, of which the Committee's program is a part,
and by the Committee's experiences since 1991, including litigation, which have demonstrated that the regulations
do not always clearly reflect the authorities given the Committee by the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act and other
laws as implemented in its procedures. The proposed rule will enable the JWOD Program to operate more efficiently
to fulfill the Committee's mission of increasing employment opportunities for people with severe disabilities
through the Government procurement process

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Committee's regulations were last substantively amended in 1991 (56 FR 48974, effective October 28, 1991). Those
amendments were the result of the first comprehensive review of the regulations since their promulgation in 1973.
The purpose of the current proposed revision to the regulations is to update them to reflect developments and changes
in procedures since 1991, and to include changes that were overlooked in the last revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Among the changes to part 51&hyph;2 on Committee responsibilities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;51&hyph;2.2(b) has been amended to make clear that the Committee authorizes and deauthorizes both central
nonprofit agencies and nonprofit agencies employing people who are blind or have other severe disabilities to accept
orders from Government agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Committee's program. Section 51&hyph;2.3 is amended to indicate that the Committee publishes notices
of proposed deletions and additions to the Procurement List and to require interested persons who submit bound comments
on these proposals to also submit an unbound copy to be duplicated for staff use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 51&hyph;2.4, 51&hyph;2.7, and 51&hyph;3.2 have been amended to make them consistent with the JWOD Act,
which considers a determination that a commodity or service is suitable for addition to the Procurement List and the
establishment of an initial fair market price for the commodity or service to be two legally separate actions. The
confusing term ``current or most recent contractor'' in &sect;51&hyph;2.4 has been changed to ``current contractor.''
An explanation of those rare instances when ``current contractor'' means ``most recent contractor'' will be addressed
in the Committee's procedural memoranda. The Committee's position that the ``current contractor'' includes affiliated
companies and parent corporations is explicitly stated in the amended &sect;51&hyph;2.4. A provision has been added
to &sect;51&hyph;2.4 to express the Committee's position that its discretion to determine what commodities and
services are suitable for addition to the Procurement List is not totally constrained by the enumerated criteria
in the section. Section 51&hyph;2.7 has also been rewritten to reflect current Committee pricing practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 51&hyph;2.5 has been amended to make clear that when the Committee decides that a proposed addition is likely
to have a severe adverse impact on a current contractor, it will decide either to reduce the portion of the Government
requirement for the commodity or service to be added to the Procurement List or will decline to add it. The Committee's
standard for reconsidering a decision to add a commodity or service to the Procurement List, which appears in an internal
memorandum, has been added to &sect;51&hyph;2.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 51&hyph;3.3, which deals with assignment of a commodity or service to a central nonprofit agency for possible
addition to the Procurement List, and &sect;&sect;51&hyph;6.4 and 51&hyph;6.12, which deal with military resale
commodities and specification changes respectively, have been rewritten to clarify their language. Small editorial
changes for clarity have been made in &sect;&sect;51&hyph;4.2 and 51&hyph;5.2. Recordkeeping provisions in &sect;51&hyph;4.3
have been changed to permit acceptance of State certifications of disability to document individuals' disability
status in accordance with recent changes in Federal disability regulations. The section title ``Violations'' used
for both &sect;&sect;51&hyph;4.5 and 51&hyph;5.8 has been changed to indicate that the former applies to violations
of Committee regulations by nonprofit agencies and the latter to violations by entities of the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 51&hyph;5.3, which sets forth the scope of the mandatory procurement source requirement of the JWOD Program,
has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended to indicate that the requirement applies to items that are essentially the same as commodities identified
on the Pro curement List by a National Stock Number or other item designation. This change was made necessary by the
increasing number of commercial items in the system which are essentially the same as Procurement List commodities.
A similar change was made in &sect;51&hyph;6.13 on replacement and similar commodities. A new paragraph was added
to &sect;51&hyph;5.3 to set forth the Committee's longstanding policy that Procurement List additions do not affect
contracts in being before the effective date of the addition, or options exercised under those contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The minimum figure for prior Committee approval of purchase exceptions granted by central nonprofit agencies in
&sect;51&hyph;5.4 has been raised from $25,000 to $100,000. The $25,000 figure was set in the 1991 revision of the
Committee regulations to correspond with the Government's small purchase limitation. The new figure corresponds
with the simplified acquisition threshold which is expected to replace the small purchase limitation. Sections
51&hyph;5.5 and 51&hyph;5.6 on prices and shipping of commodities have been amended to allow for pricing and delivery
on an FOB destination basis, consistent with recent developments in Government ordering procedures, as well as the
Committee's traditional FOB origin practice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 51&hyph;6.2 has been amended in paragraph (f) to correct an undetected typographical error in the 1991 amendments.
Section 51&hyph;6.8 on deletions from the Procurement List has been amended by adding a paragraph making it clear
that the Committee can delete a commodity or service from the Procurement List without a request from a central nonprofit
agency. A new paragraph has been added to &sect;51&hyph;6.12 on specification changes to indicate that nonprofit
agencies are to recommend changes that will improve the commodity or service being provided, reduce costs, or improve
overall value to the Government. The paragraph also requires contracting activities to respond promptly to the recommendations.
Section 51&hyph;6.13 has been amended to clarify its language and to indicate that other colors, sizes, or variations
of commodities on the Procurement List which have not been previously procured are considered to be on the Procurement
List as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 51&hyph;8.3, consisting of definitions applicable only to part 51&hyph;8 on Committee actions under the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), has been amended by removing the definition of the Committee, which also appears
in the general definitions for the Committee's regulations at &sect;51&hyph;1.3, and by changing the title ``Chairman''
to ``Chairperson'' as the title of the Committee's presiding officer. The same change to ``Chairperson'' has also
been made in &sect;&sect;51&hyph;8.7, 51&hyph;8.10, 51&hyph;8.11, and 51&hyph;9.405. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes have been made to &sect;&sect;51&hyph;8.1 and 51&hyph;8.4 and to paragraph (a) of &sect;51&hyph;8.5 to
make clear the distinction between material which the Committee is required to make available for public inspection
and material which the Committee provides in response to a FOIA request. The provision in &sect;51&hyph;8.14 for
a minimum amount for FOIA processing costs below which no fee will be charged has been qualified to indicate that the
minimum will apply to each Committee response to a FOIA request where it is necessary to make more than one response
to a request. The Committee bills FOIA requesters separately for each response, which requires a decision each time
as to whether the cost of collection would exceed the amount billed.

(a) For a commodity or service to be suitable for addition to the Procurement List, each of the following criteria must
be satisfied:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Level of impact on the current contractor for the commodity or service.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) In deciding whether or not a proposed addition to the Procurement List is likely to have a severe adverse impact
on the current contractor for the specific commodity or service, the Committee gives particular attention to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The possible impact on the contractor's total sales, including the sales of affiliated companies and parent corporations.
In addition, the Committee considers the effects of previous Committee actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Whether that contractor has been a continuous supplier to the Government of the specific commodity or service
proposed for addition and is, therefore, more dependent on the income from such sales to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Any substantive comments received as the result of the notice of the proposed addition in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Committee decision.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee considers the particular facts and circumstances in each case in determining if a commodity or service
is suitable for addition to the Procurement List. When the Committee determines that a proposed addition is likely
to have a severe adverse impact on a current contractor, it takes this fact into consideration in deciding not to add
the commodity or service to the Procurement List, or to add only a portion of the Government requirement for the item.
If the Committee decides to add a commodity or service in whole or in part to the Procurement List, that decision is announced
in the

the item remains on the Procurement List against the harm which the nonprofit agency or its employees who are blind
or have other severe disabilities would suffer if the item were deleted from the Procurement List. The Committee may
also consider information bringing into question its conclusions on the suitability criteria on which it based its
original decision as factors weighing toward a decision to delete the item, and information concerning possible
harm to the contracting activity and the JWOD Program as factors weighing toward confirmation of the original decision.

recommendations from contracting activities and the central nonprofit agency concerned. Recommendations for
fair market prices or changes thereto shall be submitted by the nonprofit agencies to the appropriate central nonprofit
agency. The central nonprofit agency shall analyze the data and submit a recommended fair market price to the Committee
accompanied by the information required by the Committee's pricing procedures to support the recommended price.
