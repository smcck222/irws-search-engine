The Service Annual Survey (SAS) is the only annual source of data on the dollar volume of receipts for various service
industries. The data is needed for national income accounting, productivity, and price measurement. The Bureau
of Economic Analysis uses SAS data in its preparation of the national income and product accounts, and its benchmark
and annual input&hyph;output tables. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) uses the data as input to its Producer Price
Indexes and in developing productivity measurements. Other government agencies use the data for program planning
and development. The SAS provides detailed information on sources of receipts and receipts lines for various industries
such as computer programming, data processing, and other computer related services, management and public relations
services, equipment rental and leasing, automotive rental and leasing, amusement parks, and offices and clinics
of health practitioners.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this notice is to announce the proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for Cryptographic
Service Calls for Federal agency use. This proposed FIPS specifies a standard interface for application programs
to request cryptographic functions from a cryptographic module. The cryptographic functions include message encryption
and decryption, message authentication, digital signature generation and verification, key management, and user
authentication. The proposed standard supports both secret key and public key algorithms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the submission of this proposed FIPS to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval, it is essential
to assure that consideration is given to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public, and State and local governments.
The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the
applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section. Only the announcement
section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested parties may obtain copies of the specifications from
the Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Building,

7. Objectives. A standard cryptographic interface will facilitate interoperability among different cryptographic
implementations. Specifically, a standard set of cryptographic service calls provides the following advantages:

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Application programmers will need to learn only one set of cryptographic service calls for multiple cryptographic
applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Cryptographic modules from different vendors, which conform to this interface standard, may be interfaced to
a given application without requiring modification to the application program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Contracts for additional cryptographic modules would not have to be sole sourced because multiple vendors would
offer the standard service calls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Vendors could build cryptographic modules which would interface to a wide variety of applications.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Applicability. This standard is applicable to all Federal departments and agencies that use cryptographic-based
security systems for the protection of unclassified information that is not subject to Section 2315 of Title 10, U.S.
Code, or Section 3502(2) of Title 44, U.S. Code. The standard shall be used by all Federal departments and agencies
in designing, acquiring and implementing cryptographic services where a cryptographic interface is to be provided.
Not all of the service calls specified in this standard need to be used in its entirety by an application. The specific
service calls that shall be used depend on the security requirements for the particular application and environment
in which the system is to be utilized. Private and commercial organizations are encouraged to adopt and use this standard
in order to facilitate interoperability among different cryptographic products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applications. The standard may be used in any application which uses cryptography to provide any of the following
cryptographic functions: message encryption/decryption, message authentication, digital signature generation
and verification, and key management. Not all the service calls specified in this standard need to be used by an application.
An application can make use of additional service calls not available in this standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Specifications. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) XXX, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Cryptographic Service Calls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Implementations. Though this document specifies a standard interface for requesting cryptographic functions,
the standard, however, does not mandate a specific implementation of these cryptographic functions other than what
are explicitly specified in the document. The cryptographic functions may in fact be implemented in software, firmware,
hardware, or any combination thereof. However, there may be other standards that are applicable to the implementation
of specific cryptographic functions. For specific requirements, the individual standard shall be referred to.
Conformance to this standard requires that the cryptographic service calls used by an application provide exactly
the same name and letter case for the service calls and their parameters as specified in the standard. In the rare case
where the standard naming and specification of the service calls and parameters may violate certain rules of a particular
programming language in use, the exception should be noted and the selected naming and case specification should
match the standard as much as possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Export Control. Certain cryptographic devices and technical data regarding them are deemed to be defense articles
(i.e., inherently military in character) and are subject to Federal government export controls as specified in Title
22, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 120&hyph;128. Some exports of cryptographic modules conforming to this standard
and technical data regarding them must comply with these Federal regulations and be licensed by the U.S. Department
of State. Other exports of cryptographic modules conforming to this standard and technical data regarding them fall
under the licensing authority of the Bureau of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Department
of Commerce is responsible for licensing cryptographic devices used for authentication, access control, proprietary
software, automatic teller machines (ATMs), and certain devices used in other equipment and software. For advice
concerning which agency has licensing authority for a particular cryptographic device, please contact the respective
agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Implementation Schedule. This standard becomes effective six months after publication of a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of its approval by the Secretary of Commerce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Qualifications. While this standard specifies a standard interface for application programs to request cryptographic
functions from a cryptographic module, conformance to this standard does not assure that a particular cryptographic
module or implementation is secure. Security requirements for a cryptographic module are addressed in FIPS 140&hyph;1.
The responsible authority in each agency or department shall assure that the overall system provides an acceptable
level of security.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Program Description.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MARFIN is a competitive Federal grant program that promotes and endorses programs that seek to optimize economic
and social benefits from marine fishery resources through cooperative efforts that involve the best research and
management talents to accomplish priority activities. Preference is given to selecting and funding applications
for project grants that provide an opportunity for cooperative NMFS/applicant efforts and for multiple cooperating
applicants/NMFS efforts with up to 3-year time horizons. Projects funded under MARFIN are focused into cooperative
efforts that provide clear answers for fishery needs covered by the NMFS Strategic Plan, available from the Southeast
Regional Office (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), particularly those goals relating to rebuilding overfished marine fisheries, maintaining currently productive
fisheries, and integrating conservation of protected species and fisheries management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications from multiple cooperating applicants that address conservation and management needs over a wide range
of a fishery or fishery organism are encouraged. Emphasis will be placed upon funding projects that have the greatest
probability of recovering, maintaining, improving, or developing fisheries; improving the understanding of factors
affecting recruitment success; and/or generating increased values and recreational opportunities from fisheries.
Projects will be evaluated as to the likelihood of achieving these benefits through both short-term and long-term
research efforts, with consideration of the magnitude of the eventual economic or social benefits that may be realized.
Short-term projects that may yield more immediate benefits, and projects yielding longer-term benefits will receive
equal consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Funding Availability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This solicitation announces that funding of approximately $1.25 million may be available in FY 1995 pending Congressional
appropriation. MARFIN financial assistance started in FY 1986, and for FY 1986 through FY 1994, awards totaled about
$15.5 million for financial assistance to conduct research for fishery resources in the Gulf of Mexico and off the
South Atlantic states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. There is no guarantee that sufficient
funds will be available to make awards for all approved projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project proposals accepted for funding for a project period over 1 year that include multiple project components
or severable tasks to be funded each budget period will not compete for funding in subsequent budget periods within
the approved project period. However, funding for subsequent project components is contingent upon the availability
of funds from Congress and satisfactory performance, and will be at the sole discretion of the agency. Publication
of this notice does not obligate NMFS to award any specific cooperative agreement or to obligate all or any parts of
the available funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Matching Requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications must reflect the total budget necessary to accomplish the project, including contributions and/or
donations. Cost-sharing is not required for the MARFIN program. However, cost-sharing is encouraged, and in case
of a tie in considering proposals for funding, cost-sharing may affect the final decision. The appropriateness of
all cost-sharing will be determined on the basis of guidance provided in applicable Federal cost principles. If an
applicant chooses to cost-share, and if that application is selected for funding, the applicant will be bound by the
percentage of the cost share reflected in the cooperative agreement award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-Federal share may include funds received from private sources or from state or local governments, or the value
of in-kind contributions by the applicant or third parties. Federal funds may not be used to meet the non-Federal share
of matching funds, except as provided by Federal statute. In-kind contributions may be in the form of, but are not limited
to, personal services rendered in carrying out functions related to the project, and use of real or personal property
owned by others (for which consideration is not required) in carrying out the projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost of a project begins on the effective date of a cooperative agreement between the applicant and the NOAA
Grants Officer and ends on the date specified in the award. Accordingly, time expended and costs incurred in either
the development of a project or the financial assistance application, or in any subsequent discussions or negotiations
prior to the award, are neither reimbursable nor recognizable as part of the recipient's cost share.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Type of Funding Instrument.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cooperative agreement has been determined to be the appropriate funding instrument. NMFS is substantially involved
in developing program research priorities, conducting cooperative activities with recipients, and evaluating
the performance of recipients for effectiveness in meeting national and regional goals for fishery research in the
southeastern United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies are needed to contribute to the regional shrimp trawler bycatch program being conducted by NMFS in cooperation
with state fishery management agencies, commercial and recreational fishing organizations and interests, environmental
organizations, universities, Councils, and Commissions. Specific guidance and research requirements are contained
in the Regional Bycatch Plan prepared through the Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Development Foundation. In particular,
the studies should address:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Data collection and analyses to expand and update current bycatch estimates temporally and spatially from offshore,
nearshore, and inshore waters, emphasizing areas of greatest shrimping impact. Sampling effort should include
estimates of numbers, weight, and age structure of the associated bycatch complex.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Assessments of the status and condition of fish stocks significantly impacted by shrimp trawler bycatch, with
emphasis given to overfished species under the jurisdiction of the Councils.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Identification, development, and evaluation of gear, non- gear and tactical fishing options to reduce bycatch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Improved methods for communicating with and improving technology and information transfer to the shrimp industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Social and economic impacts of management options to reduce shrimp fishery bycatch.

Longline Fisheries, Including Bycatch
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of pelagic longline fisheries exist in the Gulf and South Atlantic, targeting highly migratory species such
as tunas, some sharks, and swordfish. These fisheries have evolved rapidly over the last decade, with increases in
fishing effort and changes in fishing gear and tactics. These changes need to be characterized and their effects quantified.
High priority areas include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Characterization of specific longline fisheries, including targeted species, stock identification, catch-per-unit-effort
of bycatch, and biological parameters (e.g., sex ratios and reproductive state) by gear type, area and season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Evaluation of vessel log data for monitoring the fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Development and evaluation of gear and fishing tactics to minimize bycatch of undersized and unwanted species,
including sea turtles and marine mammals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Assessment of the impact of longline bycatch on related fisheries, including biological, social, and economic
factors and effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Dependence of vessels and persons engaged in pelagic longlining on other fisheries. Particular emphasis should
be placed on the extent to which the capital and/or labor engages in other fisheries at particular times of the year
and reasons for this switching behavior.

.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Secretarial FMP for sharks has been developed that identifies a number of research needs, including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Characterization of the commercial and recreational fisheries from historical and current databases. Emphasis
should be on species composition, bycatch, stock identification, size, sex ratios and catch-per-unit-effort by
season, area, and gear type.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Collection and analysis of basic biological data on movements, habitats, growth rates, mortality rates, age
structure and reproduction parameters. These data are of particular importance for blacktip and sandbar sharks.
Information on the relationship of sandbar sharks to water depth and determination of the southern boundary of its
range are specifically needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Determination of baseline cost and returns for commercial fisheries that land sharks, and estimation of demand
curves for shark products and recreational shark fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Development of species profiles and stock assessments for sharks taken in significant quantities by commercial
and recreational fishers, and as bycatch in other fisheries. Assessments can be species-specific or for species
groups, following those identified in the Atlantic Sharks FMP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Identification of coastal sharks, using laboratory methodologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Development of a more precise and accurate estimate of the recreational shark fishery. Proposals in this area
must demonstrate a knowledge of the Marine Recreational Fishery Statistical Survey (MRFSS), and should indicate
a willingness to participate directly in the MRFSS through add-on surveys or enhancement of current surveys.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Development of fishery-independent abundance indices.

Reef Fish
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of species within the reef fish complex are showing signs of being overfished, either by directed efforts
or as bycatch in other fisheries. The ecology of reef fish makes them vulnerable to overfishing because they tend to
concentrate over specific types of habitats with patchy distribution. This behavior pattern can make traditional
fishery statistics misleading. Priority research areas include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Collection of basic biological data for species in commercially and recreationally important fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Age and growth of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Description of age and growth patterns (especially red snapper, gray triggerfish and red porgy in the Gulf of Mexico
and greater amberjack in the Gulf and South Atlantic).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Development of annual age-length keys for vermilion snapper in the northern Gulf and west coast central Florida,
and for red grouper in the Gulf, along with new growth models for red grouper that include possible density-dependent
effects, as well as environmental effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reproduction studies of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Maturity schedules and fecundity of commercially and recreationally important reef fish (especially gray triggerfish
and red porgy in the Gulf of Mexico).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Detailed histological studies of red snapper to characterize the actual reproductive contribution of females,
by age.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Identification and characterization of spawning aggregations by species, areas, and seasons. Information
is especially needed on changes in sex ratios for gag grouper caused by fishing on spawning aggregations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Reproductive studies covering extensive geographic distributions along the southeastern U.S. coast (North
Carolina through the Florida Keys). Samples should be obtained from recreational (private and headboats) and commercial
vessels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Reproductive biology of gag, red grouper and other grouper species. Of particular importance are evaluation
of sperm limitation, determination of the proximal causes of sex change (whether behavioral or developmental),
determination of the annual periodicity of sex-change induction and age-specific spawning frequency, and other
research identified in the recommendations of the workshop on grouper reproduction held in Panama City, FL, in November
1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Recruitment of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Source of recruitment in Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic waters (especially amberjack and vermilion snapper),
and possible Caribbean source for Florida Keys snapper and grouper.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Annual estimation of the absolute or relative recruitment of juvenile gag to the seagrass beds off the west coast
of Florida and to similar estuarine nursery habitats along the South Atlantic Bight; development of an index of juvenile
gag recruitment for the South Atlantic based on historical databases and/or field studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Evaluation of the contribution of live-bottom habitat to reef fish recruitment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Stock structure of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Movement and migration patterns of commercially and recreationally valuable reef fish species (especially
gag and greater amberjack in the South Atlantic).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Techniques to allow field separation of lesser amberjack, almaco jack, and banded rudderfish from greater amberjack
to facilitate accurate reporting of catch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Stock structure of gag and wreckfish in the South Atlantic, and greater amberjack in the Gulf and South Atlantic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Use of parasitological surveys in species such as wreckfish and white grunt to determine stock structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Behavioral studies of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Description of the behavior of age&hyph;0 and age&hyph;1 red snapper.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Effects of fishing on reproductive behavior, in formation of aggregations and disruption of existing aggregations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Population assessment of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Effect of reproductive mode and sex change (protogynous hermaphroditism) on population size and characteristics,
with reference to sizes of fish exploited in the fisheries and the significance to proper management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Design of sampling routines to provide a production-style aging program representative of the reef fish fishery.
Effective dock-side sampling programs, especially for groupers, are needed over a wide geographic range to collect
information on reproductive state, size, age, and sex. These research needs are discussed in the report of the workshop
on grouper reproduction held in Panama City, FL, in November 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Source and quantification of natural and human-induced mortalities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Determination of the habitat and limiting factors for important reef fish resources (such as snappers in the Gulf
of Mexico). Information is also needed on the importance of human-created and natural channels for controlling stock
sizes and growth rates of snappers and groupers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Description of habitat and fish populations in the deep reef community and the prey distributions supporting
the community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Evaluation of the effect of misidentifying gag as black grouper on landing statistics and stock assessments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Development of statistically valid indices of abundance for important reef fish species in the South Atlantic
and Gulf of Mexico (especially red grouper), including spatial and temporal variations in size distribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Assessment of tag performance on reef fish species, mainly snappers and groupers. Characteristics examined
should include shedding rate, effects on growth and survival, and effects of these characteristics on estimations
of vital population parameters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Stock assessments to establish the status of major recreational and commercial species. Innovative methods
are needed for stock assessments of aggregate species, including the effect of fishing on genetic structure and the
incorporation of sex change for protogynous hermaphrodites into stock assessment models.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Fishery-independent assessments of spawning aggregations of gag, scamp, yellowedge and other groupers, using
hydroacoustic and underwater video technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Management of reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Research in direct support of management, including catch-and-release mortalities by gear and depth, the value
of limiting longlines to specific water depths (e.g., outside the 50&hyph;fathom (91.4&hyph;m) curve), and modifications
(gear, techniques) to minimize bycatch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Evaluation of the use of reef fish marine reserves as an alternative or supplement to current fishery management
measures and practices, especially in the South Atlantic. Of particular interest is Oculina Banks off the Atlantic
Coast of Florida.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Characterization and evaluation of the social and economic behavior of commercial and recreational fishermen,
and how these characteristics change in response to management measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Characterization and quantification of the biological, economic, and social impacts of the longline fishery
for reef fish along the west coast of Florida. This should include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Catch-per-unit-effort of target and bycatch species, and biological parameters (e.g., size, sex, and reproductive
state) by gear type, area, and season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Evaluation of vessel log data for monitoring the fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Development and evaluation of gear and fishing tactics to minimize the bycatch of undersized and unwanted species,
including sea turtles and marine mammals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Coastal Herrings
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminary studies indicate that substantial stocks of coastal herrings occur in the Gulf and South Atlantic. Most
of the available data are generated from fishery-independent surveys conducted by NMFS and state fishery management
agencies. Because of the size of these stocks, their importance as prey, and in some instances as predator species,
their potential for development as commercial and recreational fisheries must be understood. General research
needs include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Collection, collation, and analysis of available fishery-independent and fishery-dependent data from state
and Federal surveys, with emphasis on species and size composition, seasonal distribution patterns, biomass, bycatch,
and environmental relationships. Emphasis should be given to species such as Spanish sardine that are important
as prey to gamefish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Description and quantification of predator-prey relationships between coastal herring species and carnivores
such as mackerels, tunas, swordfish, billfish, sharks, bluefish, and others in high demand by commercial and recreational
fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Design of innovative economic and social management approaches for the purse seine menhaden fishery, including,
but not limited to, limited entry.

Coastal Migratory Pelagic Fisheries
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commercial and recreational demand for migratory coastal pelagics has led to overfishing for certain species,
including king and Spanish mackerel. Additionally, some are transboundary with Mexico and other countries and ultimately
will demand international management attention. Current high priorities include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Recruitment indices for king and Spanish mackerel, cobia, dolphin, and bluefish, primarily from fishery-independent
data sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Assessment and management models for coastal pelagic resources that are dominated by single year classes, such
as Spanish mackerel, dolphin, and bluefish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Fishery-independent methods of assessing stock abundance of king and Spanish mackerel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Improved catch statistics for all species in Mexican waters, with special emphasis on king mackerel; needed especially
is length-frequency, life history and genetic information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Information on populations of coastal pelagics overwintering off North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia,
especially population size, age and movement patterns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Basic biostatistical information on cobia and dolphin to develop age-length keys and maturation schedules for
stock assessments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Impact of bag limits on total catch and landings of king and Spanish mackerel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Demand and supply functions for recreational and commercial fisheries for king mackerel in the South Atlantic
and Gulf of Mexico. Emphasis should be on changes in marginal values of producer and consumer surpluses, since the
studies would be used in allocation frameworks where total values are not necessarily required.

Groundfish and Estuarine Fishes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substantial stocks of groundfish and estuarine species occur in the Gulf and South Atlantic. Most of the database
for assessments comes from studies conducted by NMFS and state fishery management agencies. Because of the historic
and current size of these fish stocks, their importance as predator and prey species, and their current or potential
use as commercial and recreational fisheries, more information on their biology and conservation is needed. General
research needs are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Red drum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Effects of sportfishing on red drum populations in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic. A specific need in the
South Atlantic is increased sampling of nighttime fishing for red drum on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Size and age-structure of the offshore adult red drum stock in the Gulf of Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Immigration and escapement of red drum from state waters into the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Gulf of Mexico
and the South Atlantic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Life history parameters and stock structure for the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic. Research should include
migratory patterns, long-term changes in abundance, growth rates and age structure, and comparisons of the inshore
and offshore components of recreational and/or commercial fisheries. Specific research needs for Atlantic red
drum are fecundity estimates, as a function of length and weight, and improved coastwide coverage for age-length
keys.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Catch-and-release mortality rates from inshore and nearshore waters, and fishing mortality rates in state territorial
waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Life history and stock structure for weakfish, menhaden, spot and croaker in the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic.
Research should include migratory patterns, long-term changes in abundance, growth rates and age structure, and
comparisons of the inshore and offshore components of recreational and/or commercial fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Improved catch and effort statistics from recreational and commercial fisheries, including size and age structure
of the catch, to develop production models.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Quantification and qualification of the bycatch in finfish trawl fisheries, such as the flounder and fly-net fisheries
in the South Atlantic.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are many areas of research that need to be addressed for improved understanding and management of fishery resources.
These include methods for data collection, management, analysis, and for better conservation. Examples of high
priority research needs include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Design and critical analysis of a data collection system that may involve permits, logbooks, trip interviews,
dealer reporting or other innovative methods. The system design should be applicable across the entire range of species
that may be pursued throughout the Gulf and South Atlantic, and should address economic, biological and social data
needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Assessment of the changes in recreational and commercial values that have resulted from past management practices
for red drum, shrimp, mackerels and reef fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Development of improved methods and procedures for technology transfer, and education of constituency groups
on fishery management and conservation programs. Of special importance are programs concerned with controlled
access and introduction of conservation gear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Compilation of baseline socio-demographic data for describing the social and cultural framework of managed fisheries.
B. Priority in program emphasis will be placed upon funding projects that have the greatest probability of recovering,
maintaining, improving, or developing fisheries; improving the understanding of factors affecting recruitment
success; and generating increased values and recreational opportunities from fisheries. Projects will be evaluated
as to the likelihood of achieving these benefits through short- and long-term research efforts, with consideration
given to the magnitude of the eventual economic benefits that may be realized.

XIV. Selection Procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applications will be ranked by a NMFS scientific panel into two groups: (a) Recommended, and (b) Not Recommended.
Proposals ranked as Not Recommended will not be given further consideration for selection and funding. All rankings
will be presented to a panel of non-NOAA fishery experts, who will individually consider the significance of the problem
addressed in each project proposal, the technical evaluation, and need for funding. These panel members will provide
individual recommendations to NMFS on each proposal classified as Recommended or Not Recommended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The non-NOAA panel members' individual comments, recommendations and evaluations, and recommendations of the
NMFS scientific panel and NMFS Southeast Program Officer will be considered by the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS
(Regional Director). The Regional Director, in consultation with the NOAA Assistant Administrator for Fisheries,
will: (a) Determine which projects do not substantially duplicate other projects that are currently funded by NOAA
or are approved for funding by other Federal offices, and recommend the projects to be funded. The exact amount of funds
awarded, the final scope of activities, the project duration, and specific NMFS cooperative involvement with the
activities of each project will be determined in pre-award negotiations between the applicant, the NOAA Grants Office,
and the NMFS Program Staff. Projects must not be initiated by recipients until a signed award is received from the NOAA
Grants Office. For project periods of more than 1 year, funds for subsequent budget periods may be provided if initial
project tasks are satisfactorily completed and after NMFS has received MARFIN funds for subsequent periods.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corporation is a new government corporation that encompasses the work and staff of two previously existing federal
agencies, the Commission on National and Community Service and ACTION. The Corporation's mission is to engage Americans
of all ages and backgrounds in community-based service. This service will address the nation's education, public
safety, human, and environmental needs to achieve direct and demonstrable results. In doing so, the Corporation
will foster civic responsibility, strengthen the ties that bind us together as a people, and provide education opportunity
for those who make a substantial commitment to service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Corporation will fund a new national service initiative called AmeriCorps that includes a wide variety of programs
operated by grantees, the National Civilian Community Corps, and the Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program.
The Corporation will also support service-learning initiatives for elementary and secondary schools and institutions
of higher education called Learn and Serve America, and operate the senior volunteers programs previously supported
by ACTION. Some of the national service programs will be operating this summer, and most of the others will be operational
by this fall.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Purusant to the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 (the Act), the Corporation may ``solicit, accept,
hold, administer, use, and dispose of, in furtherance of [the purposes of national service], donations of any money,
or property, real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible, received by gift, devise, bequest, or otherwise.''
42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(A). Such donations ``shall be considered to be a gift, devise, or bequest to, or for the use
of, the United States,'' 42 U.S.C. 12651g(a)(2)(B), and therefore may be allowable as a charitable tax deduction

This award involves cost sharing on the hardware, installation and evaluation of utility, grid-connected photovoltaic
systems for residential, commercial/utility sized (substation), and building-integrated applications. Sacramento
Municipal Utility Districts' (SMUD) ``sustained orderly development'' effort to advance the commercialization
of grid-connected photovoltaics plans to install about 900 kW of grid-connected PV systems. This will include about
100 residential ``PV Pioneer'' systems, several systems of the commercial/utility size, and building-integrated
applications such as PV integrated as architectural building components and demand-side management applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The phase I activities include procurement activities, including issuance of the RFP, bids, proposal evaluations,
negotiations and SMUD board approval. Phase II activities include the installation, monitoring and evaluation
of PV systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This project represents a unique opportunity to evaluate large-scale, distributed, utility grid-connected PV
applications; implement a substantial hardware procurement; and support the commercialization of grid-connected
photovoltaics. SMUD has a high probability of achieving the project objectives based on past projects, a ``large''
service area for the implementation of grid-connected applications and community commitment to the adoption of
PV technology. SMUD's resources and commitment to extending the utility PV collaborative process and promoting
cooperative ventures to accelerate the commercialization of utility PV applications should provide a basis for
the successful implementation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Murphy is a petroleum refiner and a producer subject to the audit jurisdiction of ERA to determine compliance with
the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations. During the period covered by the proposed Consent Order,
January 1, 1973 through January 28, 1981, Murphy engaged in, among other things, the production, sale and refining
of crude oil. On February 9, 1987, Murphy and DOE entered into a Consent Order (hereinafter the 1987 Consent Order)
that settled, with certain specific exceptions, all claims and disputes against Murphy by DOE for the period January
1, 1973 through January 28, 1981. The 1987 Consent Order specifically excepted, among other things, issues or claims
then pending or arising out of first sales of crude oil produced and sold from properties operated by Murphy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of DOE's investigation of Murphy's compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations
during the period covered by the proposed Consent Order, ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Murphy on December
15, 1986. On June 17, 1992, DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) modified the PRO and issued it as a Remedial Order
(RO) to Murphy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 22 DOE &para; 83,005 (1992). The RO finds Murphy liable to make restitution of $13,366,664.60, plus interest to
the date of restitution, for violations of the regulations applicable to first sales of domestic crude oil (10 CFR
&sect;&sect;212.72&hyph;212.74), the regulations exempting from the price rules the sale of crude oil produced
from ``stripper well'' properties (10 CFR &sect;&sect;210.32 and 212.54), and the normal business practices rule
(10 CFR &sect;210.62(c)) in connection with Murphy's first sales of crude oil during the period September 1973 through
December 1979. With interest, Murphy's current liability under the RO would total $67.6 million through June 1994.
Murphy appealed that RO to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RO also remands for further proceedings claims against Murphy pertaining to Murphy's operation of properties
for which the PRO found violations during the year 1979, as well as certain crude oil properties not included within
ERA's investigation of Murphy or within the PRO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 24, 1994, a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued a decision and proposed order (D&amp;PO) that modified
the RO and directed recalculation of the amount of restitution.

, 66 FERC &para;63,002 (1994). The D&amp;PO is now pending before the Commission in Docket No. RO92&hyph;5&hyph;000.
With interest, Murphy's current liability under the D&amp;PO (including ERA's estimate of Murphy's liability for
previously unaudited properties and unaudited time periods (yet to be adjudicated by OHA or FERC)) totals approximately
$5.2 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ERA has preliminarily agreed to the proposed $10,700,000 settlement as resolution of Murphy's liability for DOE
regulatory violations for the period covered by the proposed Consent Order. ERA has made this tentative determination
after an assessment of the risks of the current matters in litigation. Among other things, ERA has considered the risk
pertaining to the following issues that Murphy has raised in its defense: whether Murphy properly applied the definition
of ``property'' to certain of its offshore and onshore producing premises in the period September 1973 through August
1976; whether the largest of Murphy's offshore producing premises qualified as multiple DOE ``properties'' under
DOE Rulings 1977&hyph;1 and 1977&hyph;2; whether Murphy charged prices in excess of the appropriate ceiling prices
for crude oil produced from offshore and onshore properties that it operated; whether Murphy should be liable for
100% of the overcharges associated with sales of crude oil that had been taken ``in kind'' from Murphy-operated properties
and sold by working interest owners; and whether Murphy should be liable for 100% of the overcharges associated with
certain sales of crude oil from Murphy-operated properties as to which the federal government received a royalty
interest. ERA has also considered the time and expense that would be required for the government to litigate every
issue fully. Based on these factors, ERA has tentatively concluded that the resolution of its claims against Murphy
for $10,700,000 is an appropriate settlement and in the public interest. Except as specifically excluded, all pending
and potential civil and administrative disputes, claims and causes of action, whether or not heretofore asserted,
between the DOE and Murphy relating to Murphy's compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations
are resolved and extinguished by this Consent Order. Murphy and DOE mutually release each other from the claims arising
under the subject matter covered by the proposed Consent Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the terms of the proposed Consent Order, Murphy is required to pay the sum of $10,700,000 within thirty (30) days
of the effective date of the Consent Order and shall maintain records as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with
the terms of this Consent Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the settlement is not made final by the one hundred fiftieth (150th) day following execution, Murphy may withdraw
from the proposed agreement.

). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant proposes the first food use of an active ingredient; therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA
is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a state agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for the use of imidacloprid on head and leaf lettuce, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower to control the
sweet potato, or silverleaf whitefly (SLW). Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of
this request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicant states that a new strain, or possibly a new species, of whitefly, often referred to as the strain B of sweet
potato whitefly, or silverleaf whitefly (SLW), was initially found in Arizona in 1988. Since that time, it has steadily
spread to new host plants and grown in population size each summer and fall. The SLW causes damage by feeding, and also
through the production of honeydew, which encourages growth of sooty mold and other fungi. When SLWs become numerous
as they did in many areas of the state in the past several years, their direct feeding lowers the yield. The SLW has also
been implicated as a vector of virus. The Applicant claims that adequate control of the SLW is not being achieved with
currently registered products and alternative cultural practices. Along with this request, the Applicant has also
requested a specific exemption for use of a different chemical, bifenthrin, on the named crops, for control of the
same pest. The Applicant justifies requests for two chemicals, by stating that the imidacloprid would be applied
once at planting, as a soil treatment; since imidacloprid is a systemic, it would be taken up by the seedling as it germinates,
and protect the emerging seedling. The Applicant states that bifenthrin can only be applied as a foliar spray, which
is of little value during the early establishment phase of seedling development, as there is limited leaf area at that
time. Thus the Applicant proposed that use of bifenthrin be allowed later in the crop season, as a foliar treatment.
The Applicant indicates that imidacloprid would not be of use as both a soil treatment and a foliar spray, because its
mode of action is such that resistance development is a concern. The Registrant of imidacloprid will not support the
use of this chemical further into the growing season for this reason. The Applicant indicates that without adequate
control of the SLW in the named crops, significant economic losses will be suffered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 5 oz. (dry) active ingredient (20 fluid oz. of product)
per acre with a maximum of one application per crop season on a total of 73,100 acres of the above-listed crops. For each
of the crops named, it is possible to produce two crops per calendar year on a given acre, and therefore, the acreage
could potentially receive two applications of imidacloprid per calendar year. However, the Applicant proposes
to limit the maximum amount which could be applied per calendar year to 0.5 lb. a.i. (32 fl. oz. product) per acre. Therefore,
use under this exemption could potentially amount to a maximum total of 36,550 lbs. of active ingredient, or 18,275
gal. of product. This is the second time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid on the named crops.
The Applicant received specific exemptions last year (1993) for imidacloprid on broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage,
and head and leaf lettuce, and for bifenthrin on broccoli, cauliflower, and head lettuce. In 1992, the Applicant was
granted specific exemptions for the use of bifenthrin for SLW control in broccoli, cauliflower, and head lettuce.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because of the highly specialized nature of termiticides, a number of issues evolved over the years with regard to
products' labeling: (1) limitations on distribution, sale, or use; (2) precautionary statements; (3) environmental
hazards statements; (4) storage and disposal statements; (5) use directions; (6) the longevity of termiticide treatments;
and (7) application at less-than-labeled rates. In 1988, representatives from the termiticide manufacturing and
user industry, State pesticide regulatory officials, and EPA representatives met voluntarily under the auspices
of the Association of American Pesticide Control Officials (AAPCO) and the State FIFRA Issues Research and Evaluation
Group (SFIREG) to identify specific issues to be addressed. The identified issues were set forth in AAPCO/SFIREG's
1989 Termiticide Labeling Report and were endorsed by the Association of Structural Pest Control Regulatory Officials
(ASPCRO).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 American Cyanamid Co., Agricultural Research Division, P.O. Box 400, Princeton, NJ 08543&hyph;0400, has requested
in pesticide petition (PP) 3G4203 the establishment of a temporary tolerance for residues of the herbicide cadre
Ammonium salt of (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
-imidazol-2-yl]-5-methyl-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid in or on the raw agricultural commodity peanut hulls or meat
at 0.1 part per million (ppm). This temporary tolerance will permit the marketing of the above raw agricultural commodity
when treated in accordance with the provisions of the experimental use permit 241-EUP-125, which is being issued
under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended (Pub. L. 95&hyph;396, 92 Stat.
819; 7 U.S.C. 136). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that establishment
of the temporary tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerance has been established
on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit and with the following provisions:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental
use permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. American Cyanamid Co., must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing
on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the
records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This tolerance expires May 31, 1996. Residues not in excess of this amount remaining in or on the raw agricultural commodity
after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term of,
and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerance. This tolerance may
be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this pesticide
indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health.

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12866.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612),

Section 7A(b)(2) of the Act permits the agencies, in individual cases, to terminate this waiting period prior to its
expiration and requires that notice of this action be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other things, a Tennessee-based
corporation that provides acute care hospital services to divest Holy Cross Hospital of Salt Lake City to a Commission
approved acquirer; to complete the divestiture within six months of the date of the order; and to consent to the appointment
of a trustee, if the divestiture is not completed within six months. In addition, the proposed consent agreement would
require the respondent to obtain prior Commission approval, for ten years, before purchasing any acute care hospital
or any hospital, medical or surgical diagnostic or treatment service or facility in the Utah counties of Weber, Davis,
and Salt Lake.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. This agreement shall not become a part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify the proposed

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

When so entered, the order shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the same
manner and within the same time provided by statute for other orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery
by the U.S. Postal Service of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to order to respondent's address as
stated in this agreement shall constitute service. The proposed respondent waives any right it may have to any other
manner of service. The complaint may be used in construing the terms of the order, and no agreement, understanding,
representation, or interpretation not contained in the order or this agreement may be used to vary or contradict the
terms of the order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agreement to Hold Separate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This Agreement to Hold Separate (``Agreement'') is by and between Healthtrust, Inc._The Hospital Company (``respondent''
or ``Healthtrust''), a corporation organized, existing, and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of the
State of Delaware, with its principal place of business at 4525 Harding Road, Nashville, Tennessee 37205; and the
Federal Trade Commission (``Commission''), an independent agency of the United States Government, established
under the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, 15 U.S.C. 41, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, on or about December 3, 1993, respondent entered into an agreement with Holy Cross Health System Corporation (``Holy
Cross''), an Indiana corporation, whereby respondent will acquire from Holy Cross certain Holy Cross assets in Utah
(hereinafter the ``Acquisition''); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission is now investigating the Acquisition to determine if it would violate any of the statutes enforced
by the Commission; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, if the Commission accepts the attached Agreement Containing Consent Order (``Consent Order''), which would require
the divestiture of certain assets listed in Schedule A of the Consent Order (``Schedule A Assets''), including Holy
Cross Hospital (``HCH'') in Salt Lake City, Utah, the Commission must place the Consent Order on the public record
for a period of at least sixty (60) days and may subsequently withdraw such acceptance pursuant to the provisions of
Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules' and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission is concerned that if an understanding is not reached, preserving the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
status quo ante
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the Schedule A Assets during the period prior to the final acceptance and issuance of the Consent Order by the Commission
(after the 60-day public comment period), divestiture resulting from any proceeding challenging the legality of
the Acquisition might not be possible, or might be less than an effective remedy; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission is concerned that if the Acquisition is consummated, it will be necessary to preserve the Commission's
ability to require the divestiture of the Schedule A Assets as described in Paragraph II of the Consent Order and the
Commission's right to have HCH continue as a viable independent acute care hospital; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, the purpose of this Agreement and the Consent Order is to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) preserve HCH as a viable independent acute care hospital pending its divestiture, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) remedy any anticompetitive effects of the Acquisition;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, respondent's entering into this Agreement shall in no way be construed as an admission by respondent that the Acquisition
is illegal; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, respondent understands that no act or transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed immune or exempt
from the provisions of the antitrust laws or the Federal Trade Commission Act by reason of anything contained in this
Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Now, therefore,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 the parties agree, upon understanding that the Commission has not yet determined whether the Acquisition will be
challenged, and in consideration of the Commission's agreement that, unless the Commission determines to reject
the Consent Order, it will not seek further relief from respondent with respect to the Acquisition, except that the
Commission may exercise any and all rights to enforce this Agreement and the Consent Order to which it is annexed and
made a part thereof, and in the event the required divestiture is not accomplished, to appoint a trustee to seek divestiture
of the Schedule A Assets pursuant to the Consent Order, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Respondent agrees to execute the Agreement Containing Consent Order and be bound by the attached Consent Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Respondent agrees that from the date this Agreement is accepted until the earliest of the dates listed in subparagraphs
2.a-2.b, it will comply with the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Agreement:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. three (3) business days after the Commission withdraws its acceptance of the Consent Order pursuant to the provisions
of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. the day after the divestiture required by the Consent Order has been completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Respondent will hold the Schedule A Assets as they are presently constituted separate and apart on the following
terms and conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The Schedule A Assets, as they are presently constituted, shall be held separate and apart and shall be operated
independently of respondent (meaning here and hereinafter, Healthtrust excluding the Schedule A Assets) except
to the extent that respondent must exercise direction and control over the Schedule A Assets to assure compliance
with this Agreement or the Consent Order, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Prior to, or simultaneously with its acquisition of the Holy Cross assets in Utah, respondent shall organize a distinct
and separate legal entity, either a corporation, limited liability company, general or limited partnership (``New
Company'') and adopt constituent documents for the New Company that are not inconsistent with other provisions of
this Agreement or the Consent Order. Respondent shall transfer all ownership and control of all Schedule A Assets
to the New Company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The board of directors of the New Company, or, in the event respondent organizes an entity other than a corporation,
the governing body of the entity (``New Company Board'') shall have five members. Respondent may elect the members
of the New Company Board; provided, however, that the New Company Board shall include no more than two members who are
a director, officer, employee, or agent of respondent (``the respondent's New Company Board member(s)''). The New
Company Board shall include a chairman who is independent of respondent and is competent to assure the continued viability
and competitiveness of the Schedule A Assets. Meetings of the New Company Board during the term of this Agreement shall
be stenographically transcribed and the transcripts retained for two (2) years after the termination of this Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Respondent shall not exercise direction or control over, or influence directly or indirectly, the Schedule A Assets,
the independent Chairman of the Board of the New Company, the New Board, or the New Company or any of its operations or
businesses; provided, however, that respondent may exercise only such direction and control over the New Company
as is necessary to assure compliance with this Agreement or the Consent Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Respondent shall maintain the viability and competitiveness and the marketability of the Schedule A Assets and
shall not sell, transfer, encumber (other than in the normal course of business), or otherwise impair their viability
and competitiveness or their marketability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Except for the respondent's New Company Board members, respondent shall not permit any director, officer, employee,
or agent of respondent to also be a director, officer, or employee of the New Company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. The New Company shall be staffed with sufficient employees to maintain the viability and competitiveness of the
Schedule A Assets, which employees shall be selected from Holy Cross's existing employee base and may also be hired
from sources other than Holy Cross.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. With the exception of the respondent's New Company Board Members, respondent shall not change the composition
of the New Company Board unless the independent chairman consents. The independent chairman shall have power to remove
members of the New Company Board for cause. Respondent shall not change the composition of the management of the New
Company except that the New Company Board shall have the power to remove management employees for cause.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
i. If the independent chairman ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute chairman shall be appointed in
the same manner as provided in Paragraph 3.c. of this Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Except as required by law, and except to the extent that necessary information is exchanged in the course of evaluating
the Acquisition, defending investigations or defending or prosecuting litigation, or negotiating agreements
to divest assets, or complying with this Agreement or the Consent Order, respondent shall not receive or have access
to, or use or continue to use, any material confidential information not in the public domain about the New Company
or the activities of the New Company Board. Nor shall the New Company or the New Company Board receive or have access
to, or use or continue to use, any material confidential information not in the public domain about respondent and
relating to respondent's acute care hospitals in Utah. Respondent may receive on a regular basis aggregate financial
information relating to the New Company necessary and essential to allow respondent to prepare United States consolidated
financial reports, tax returns and personnel reports. Any such information that is obtained pursuant to this subparagraph
shall be used only for the purposes set forth in this subparagraph. (``Material confidential information,'' as used
herein, means competitively sensitive or proprietary information not independently known to respondent from sources
other than the New Company, and includes but is not limited to customer lists, price lists, marketing methods, patents,
technologies, processes, or other trade secrets.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. Except as permitted by this Agreement, the respondent's New Company Board members shall not in their capacity as
New Company Board members, receive material confidential information and shall not disclose any such information
received under this Agreement to respondent or use it to obtain any advantage for respondent. The respondent's New
Company Board members shall enter a confidentiality agreement prohibiting disclosure of material confidential
information. The respondent's New Company Board members shall participate in matters that come before the New Company
Board only for the limited purposes of considering a capital investment or other transaction exceeding $250,000,
approving any proposed budget and operating plans, and carrying out respondent's responsibilities under this Agreement
and the Consent Order. Except as permitted by this Agreement, the respondent's New Company Board members shall not
participate in any matter, or attempt to influence the votes of the other members of the New Company Board with respect
to matters, that would involve a conflict of interest if respondent and the New Company were separate and independent
entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
l. If necessary to assure compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the Consent Agreement, or the Consent Order,
respondent may, but is not required to, assign an individual to the New Company for the purpose of overseeing such compliance
(``on-site person''). The on-site person shall have access to all officers and employees of the New Company and such
records of the New Company as he deems necessary and reasonable to assure compliance. Such individual shall enter
into a confidentiality agreement prohibiting disclosure of material confidential information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
m. Any material transaction of the New Company that is out of the ordinary course of business must be approved by a majority
vote of the New Company Board; provided that the New Company shall engage in no transaction, material or otherwise,
that is precluded by this Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
n. All earnings and profits of the New Company shall be retained separately in the New Company. If necessary, respondent
shall provide the New Company with sufficient working capital to operate at its current rate of operation, and to carry
out any capital improvement plans for the New Company which have already been approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
o. During the period commencing on the date this Agreement is effective and terminating on the earlier of (i) six months
after the date the Consent Order becomes final, or (ii) the date contemplated by subparagraph 2.a (the ``Initial Divestiture
Period''), respondent shall make available for use by the New Company funds sufficient to perform all necessary routine
maintenance to, and replacements of, the Schedule A Assets (``normal repair and replacement''). After termination
of the Initial Divestiture Period and until the earlier of the date contemplated by either subparagraph 2.a or 2.b,
respondent shall make available for use by the New Company each year an amount not less than that required for normal
repair and replacement, plus $1,000,000 for capital improvements to the Schedule A Assets, unless a smaller amount
is requested or required by the New Company, in its sole discretion, for capital expenditures. Provided, however,
that in any event, respondent shall provide the New Company with such funds as are necessary to maintain the viability
and competitiveness and marketability of the Schedule A Assets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Should the Federal Trade Commission seek in any proceeding to compel respondent to divest any of the Schedule A Assets,
as provided in the Consent Order, or to seek any other injunctive or equitable relief for any failure to comply with
the Consent Order or this Agreement, or in any way relating to the Acquisition, as defined in the draft complaint, respondent
shall not raise any objection based upon the expiration of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act waiting period or the fact that the Commission has permitted the Acquisition. Respondent also waives all rights
to contest the validity of this Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. To the extent that this Agreement requires respondent to take, or prohibits respondent from taking, certain actions
that otherwise may be required or prohibited by contract, respondent shall abide by the terms of this Agreement or
the Consent Order and shall not assert as a defense such contract requirements in a civil penalty action brought by
the Commission to enforce the terms of this Agreement or Consent Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. For the purpose of determining or securing compliance with this Agreement, subject to any legally recognized privilege,

any duly authorized representative or representatives of the Commission:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Access during the office hours of respondent and in the presence of counsel to inspect and copy all books, ledgers,
accounts, correspondence, memoranda, and other records and documents in the possession or under the control of respondent
relating to compliance with this Agreement;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Upon five (5) days' notice to respondent, and without restraint or interference from respondent, to interview
officers or employees of respondent, who may have counsel present, regarding any such matters.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, a proposed consent order from Healthtrust
Inc._The Hospital Company (``Healthtrust''). The agreement would settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission
that Healthtrust's proposed acquisition of three hospitals from Holy Cross Health System Corporation (``Holy Cross'')
would have violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, if it had been carried
out.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or issue and serve the agreement's proposed order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both Healthtrust and Holy Cross own and operate acute care hospitals in various states, including acute care hospitals
in the Salt Lake City area, encompassing Salt Lake County and southern Davis County; and the Salt Lake City_Ogden Metropolitan
Statistical Area, an area encompassing three contiguous counties in northern Utah: Weber County, Davis County,
and Salt Lake County (``Three-County Area''). The complaint accompanying the proposed consent order concerns the
proposed acquisition's impact upon competition for acute care hospital services in the Salt Lake City area and the
Three-County Area. According to the complaint, Healthtrust owns and operates Lakeview Hospital in Bountiful (in
southern Davis County) and Pioneer Valley Hospital in West Valley City (in Salt Lake County). Holy Cross owns and operates
St. Benedict's Hospital in Ogden (in Weber County), and two acute care hospitals in Salt Lake County, Holy Cross Hospital
in Salt Lake City, and Holy-Cross-Jordan Valley Hospital in West Jordan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consent order, if finally accepted by the Commission, would settle charges that the acquisition may substantially
lessen competition in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area. The complaint alleges that Healthtrust and
Holy Cross are competitors in those markets. The hospital markets in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area,
according to the complaint, were already highly concentrated, and entry by new competitors would be difficult. The
complaint alleges that the Commission has reason to believe that the acquisition would have anticompetitive effects
in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area hospital markets, in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and
Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, unless an effective remedy eliminates such anticompetitive effects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The order accepted for public comment contains provisions requiring the divestiture by Healthtrust of the Holy Cross
Hospital and related assets, including interests in five clinics, in Salt Lake City, Utah. The purpose of the divestiture
is to ensure the continuation of Holy Cross Hospital as an ongoing, viable acute care hospital independent of Healthtrust,
and to remedy the lessening of competition in the Salt Lake City area and the Three-County Area hospital markets resulting
from the acquisition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires Healthtrust to obtain the approval of the Commission for the divestiture of Holy Cross
Hospital. Under the terms of the order, the required divestiture must be completed within six months of the date the
order becomes final. If the required divestiture were not completed within the six-month period, Healthtrust would
consent to the appointment of a trustee, who would have twelve additional months to effect the divestiture. The hold
separate agreement executed as part of the consent order requires Healthtrust, until the completion of the divestiture
or as otherwise specified, to hold separate and preserve all of the assets and businesses of Holy Cross Hospital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order provides that approval by the Commission of the divestiture shall be conditioned upon the agreement
by the acquirer that, for ten years from the date of the divestiture, it will not sell, without the prior approval of
the Commission, Holy Cross Hospital to another person operating (or in the process of acquiring) any other acute care
hospital in the Three-County Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The order would prohibit Healthtrust from acquiring any acute care hospital in the Three-County Area without the
prior approval of the Federal Trade Commission. It would also prohibit Healthtrust from transferring, without prior
Commission approval, any acute care hospital it operates in the Three-County Area to another person operating (or
in the process of acquiring) an acute care hospital in the area. These provisions, in combination, would give the Commission
authority to prohibit any substantial combination of the acute care hospital operations of Healthtrust with those
of any other acute care hospital in the Three-County Area, unless Healthtrust convinced the Commission that a particular
transaction would not endanger competition in the Salt Lake City area or the Three-County Area. The provisions would
not apply to acquisitions or sales where the value of the transferred assets is $1 million or less, and the provisions
would expire ten years after the order becomes final.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For ten years, the order would prohibit Healthtrust from transferring all or any substantial part of any hospital
in the Three-County Area to another party without first filing with the Commission an agreement by the transferee
to be bound by the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to invite public comment concerning the proposed order, to assist the Commission in
its determination whether to make the order final. This analysis is not intended to constitute an official interpretation
of the agreement and order or to modify their terms in any way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by Healthtrust that its proposed
acquisition would have violated the law, as alleged in the Commission's complaint.

I voted against acceptance of the proposed consent agreement in this matter, as well as against a previous motion to
seek a preliminary injunction to enjoin HealthTrust from acquiring three Holy Cross hospitals in the Salt Lake City,
Utah, area. The three hospitals to be acquired were: Jordan Valley, a 50-bed hospital located in the Salt Lake City
metropolitan area; St. Benedict's, a 239-bed tertiary level hospital
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 located approximately 34 miles north of Salt Lake City in Ogden; and a 200-bed tertiary facility located in downtown
Salt Lake City. In analyzing the original proposed transaction, I concluded that the merger of these two hospital
systems would generate significant net efficiencies that would outweigh any potential anticompetitive effects
of the merger in the Salt Lake City Metropolitan area and throughout the Wasatch Front. Specifically, the Holy Cross
hospitals offered HealthTrust the opportunity to expand its geographic coverage by including hospitals located
throughout the Wasatch Front, and broaden the services it provided by including a downtown Salt Lake City tertiary
care facility.

Medical services are generally divided into primary, secondary, tertiary and now quaternary levels. Primary services
are provided by generalists, including family practitioners, pediatricians, obstetricians, and internists.
Secondary services are provided by specialists, such as cardiologists, oncologists, and orthopedic specialists.
Tertiary services are those provided by sub-specialists, such as invasive cardiology or neurosurgery. Quaternary
level services are those offered by only a few highly specialized facilities, like high level burn units or organ transplants.
The demarcation between the various levels of service is not precise, but these levels are all included as part of the
``acute care inpatient hospital services'' market alleged in the complaint here.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed consent allows HealthTrust to acquire two of the Holy Cross hospitals, Jordan Valley and St. Benedict's,
while requiring divestiture of the downtown Holy Cross hospital. Allowing HealthTrust to acquire the two Holy Cross
hospitals will give HealthTrust better geographic coverage across the Wasatch Front. However, requiring the divestiture
of the downtown Holy Cross facility means that the newly formed hospital network will not include a tertiary care facility
in the Salt Lake City Metropolitan area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was argued in this case (as it has been argued in several recent hospital mergers) that the merging hospital systems
can achieve network and operational efficiencies through acquisition that are not possible through alternative
arrangements such as contracting or joint venturing. Parties have sought to show that contracting and joint venturing
is inefficient as an alternative to outright merger, among other reasons, because of the need to deter ``gaming''
on patient referrals as each hospital attempts to shift costly patients to other hospitals. This argument seems plausible
in this industry because of contracting problems involved in establishing ``capitation'' regimes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this particular case, it was argued that purchasing a downtown Salt Lake City tertiary care facility was essential
to achieve network efficiencies and that contracting or joint venturing was an inferior alternative. I find this
argument persuasive.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, because I believe that the bulk of the network and operational efficiencies that are possible from this
merger will be lost if the downtown facility is divested, and because I believe that the potential anticompetitive
effects that may have resulted from allowing HealthTrust to acquire the downtown facility are outweighed by those
efficiencies, I have dissented from the issuance of this consent.

The relative effectiveness of different organizational forms such as mergers, joint ventures or contracting relationships
deserves further study in light of the current restructuring of the health care industry. While I agree that network
efficiency claims may be more credible if they are endorsed by health plans (see Remarks of Mary Lou Steptoe before
the Practicing Law Institute, June 17&hyph;20, 1994) we are often presented with situations of ``dueling'' affidavits,
in which case other evidence must be present to support such claims.

this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other things, the New
Jersey corporation and its officer to pay $1.45 million to the United States Treasury, would prohibit the respondents
from making misrepresentations regarding the efficacy of their bodybuilding an weight loss products, and would
require them to possess competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate future bodybuilding and weight
loss claims.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from respondents L&amp;S Research
Corporation and Scott Chinery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's complaint charges that the respondents deceptively advertised Cybergenics Total Body Building
System and Cybergenics for Hard Gainers, two body building products. According to the complaint, the respondents'
advertisements made false and/or unsubstantiated representations that either or both body building products:
(1) cause users to lose more body fat and gain more muscle than non-users; (2) cause users to lose body fat and gain muscle
more rapidly than non-users; (3) cause users to gain more muscle than users of other body building products; (4) have
been demonstrated by scientific research to cause users to gain more muscle than non-users; (5) work for all people;
and (6) are new and unique.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's complaint also charges that the respondents deceptively advertised there weight loss products,
Cybergenics CyberTrim, Cybergenics Mega-Fat Burner, and Cybergenics QuickTrim. According to the complaint, the
respondents' advertisements made false and/or unsubstantiated representations that one or more of the wright loss
products: (1) cause users to lose body fat and weight more rapidly than non-users; (2) cause users to lose weight and
lose or burn more body fat than non-users; (3) cause users to lose more body fat and weight than users of all other weight
loss products; (4) cause users to lose weight more rapidly than the users of all other weight loss products; (5) are
superior to other appetite suppressants; (6) suppress hunger and the biochemical message stimulated by the catabolism
of fat; (7) cause users to gain more muscle than non-users; (8) contain an ingredient, chromium picolinate, that has
been clinically proven to reduce fat and lower cholesterol; (9) are new and unique; (10) cause users to maintain weight
loss longer than non-users; (11) cause maturing women to lose more weight than non-users of the product; (12) are easy
to use; and (13) have been demonstrated by scientific evidence to cause users to lose more fat and weight, and to gain
more muscle, than non-users.

Use of Testimonials
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's complaint also charges that statements and depictions, including ``before'' and ``after'' pictures,
in the respondents' advertisements for their body building and weight loss products, represent that the testimonials
from consumers who use the advertised product reflect the typical or ordinary experience of members of the public
who use the products. According to the complaint, the respondents did not have a reasonable basis for this representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the complaint alleges that the use of a picture of a man in an advertisement for Cybergenics Total Body
Building System ``before'' and ``after'' he used the product for six months is false and misleading. The man pictured
in the advertisement, according to the complaint, was a champion body builder prior to the time when the ``before''
picture was taken and, therefore, is not typical of users of the product, and his results as shown in the ``after'' picture
are not typical of the experience of ordinary members of the public who use the product.

Proposed Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part I of the proposed order prohibits representations that the product component of either of the body building products
named in the complaint, or any substantially similar product:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) causes users to achieve greater or more rapid loss of fat or gain of muscle than non-users of the product; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) works for all users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part II of the proposed order prohibits representations that the product component of any of the three weight loss
products named in the complaint, or any substantially similar product:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) causes users to maintain weight loss longer than non-users; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) causes maturing women to lose more weight than non-users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part III prohibits respondents from representing that scientific evidence establishes that the product component
of any of the body building and weight loss products named in the complaint causes users to lose more fat or weight, or
gains more muscle, than non-users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part IV requires the respondents to cease from making a number of representations about any product or program unless
they have substantiation consisting of competent and reliable scientific evidence. The claims that are prohibited
unless substantiated are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) that any product or program causes or assists users to lose fat or weight or to maintain weight loss, or suppresses
hunger or appetite;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) that any product or program causes or assists in muscle gain or development;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) that any product or program works for all users;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) that chromium picolinate in any product or used in conjunction with any program builds muscle, reduces fat, or
lowers cholesterol; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) that any product or program intended for body building, weight loss, or fat loss is more effective than other products
or programs intended for similar purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part V of the proposed order requires respondents to have substantiation, which when appropriate must consist of
competent and reliable scientific evidence, for believing that endorsements, including ``before'' and ``after''
pictures, represent the typical or ordinary experience of users of any product or program. However, the respondents
may use any endorsement if they disclose clearly and prominently in close proximity to the endorsement what the generally
expected performance would be in the depicted circumstances, or that consumers should not expect to achieve results
similar to those of the endorser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part VI prohibits the respondents from misrepresenting that any product or program is new or unique, or that any product
or program intended for weight loss is easy to use if achieving the advertised results requires a special diet or exercise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part VII requires the respondents to cease misrepresenting the contents, validity, or results of any study in connection
with the marketing or any product or program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part VIII requires the respondents to pay $1,450,000 to the United States Treasury and provides that none of this amount
is deemed to be a fine, penalty, or punitive assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining provisions are standard record keeping and reporting provisions designed to ensure that the respondents
remain in compliance with the other provisions of the order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has strong evidence supporting the central allegations in this complaint, and I have voted to accept
the consent agreement for public comment. In my view, however, the complaint should not allege that the maintenance
claim for Mega-Fat Burner and the maturing women weight loss claim for QuickTrim were false. I am inclined to believe
that the claims are false but I would prefer to have some corroborating evidence of falsity before finding reason to
believe that Section 5 of the FTC Act has been violated. Because the available information shows only that there is
no evidence that these claims are true, it seems to me more appropriate to allege that they are unsubstantiated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the QuickTrim weight loss allegations seem inconsistent in light of the evidence. The complaint alleges
that the weight loss claim for maturing women users of QuickTrim is false but alleges that the same claim for all users
of QuickTrim is unsubstantiated. Yet we have no evidence indicating that the weight loss claims are any more likely
to be false for maturing women than for users generally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I therefore do not support the complaint to the extent that the maintenance claim for Mega-Fat Burner and the maturing
women weight loss claim for QuickTrim are alleged to be false, not unsubstantiated.

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other things, a Ohio-based
drugstore chain to divest, within one year of the order, to a Commission approved acquirer, all assets related to the
retail sale of prescription drugs in either the respondent's store or in the acquired Hook-SupeRx (HSI) retail store
in each of three geographic areas, and to complete the divestiture within one year. If not complete in that period of
time, the order would require the respondent to consent to the appointment of a trustee to divest the assets. In addition,
the proposed consent agreement would require the respondent to obtain prior Commission approval, for ten years,
before acquiring any similar business interest in any of the three specified towns.

The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') having initiated an investigation of the proposed acquisition of
all of the voting stock of Hook SupeRx, Inc. (``HSI''), by Revco D.S., Inc. (``Revco''), and it is now appearing that
Revco, hereinafter sometimes referred to as ``Proposed Respondent,'' is willing to enter into an agreement containing
an order (``Agreement'') to divest certain assets, and to cease and desist from making certain acquisitions, and
providing for certain other relief:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby agreed by and between Proposed Respondent, by its duty authorized officers and attorneys, and counsel
for the Commission that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Proposed Respondent Revco is a corporation organized, existing, and doing business under and by the virtue of the
laws of the State of Delaware with its office and principal place of business located at 1925 Enterprise Parkway, Twinsburg,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Proposed Respondent admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft of complaint here attached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Proposed Respondent waives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. the requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. all rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. any claim under the Equal Access to Justice Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. This Agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this Agreement is accepted by the Commission it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify the Proposed
Respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. This Agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by Proposed Respondent that
the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of complaint here attached, or that the facts as alleged in the draft
complaint, other than the jurisdictional facts, are true. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. This Agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently
withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission
may, without further notice to the Proposed Respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance
with the draft of complaint here attached and its decision containing the following Order to divest and to cease and
desist in disposition of the proceeding, and (2) make information public with respect thereto. When so entered, the
Order shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the same manner and within the
same time provided by statute for other orders. The Order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the United States
Postal Service of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to Order to Proposed Respondent's address as
stated in this Agreement shall constitute service. Proposed Respondent waives any right it may have to any other manner
of services. The complaint may be used in construing the terms of the Order, and no agreement, understanding, representation,
or interpretation not contained in the Order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the Order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Proposed Respondent has read the proposed Complaint and Order contemplated hereby. Proposed Respondent understands
that once the Order has been issued, it will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that it has fully
complied with the Order. Proposed Respondent further understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the
amount provided by law for each violation of the Order after it becomes final.

 That: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Respondent shall divest, absolutely and in good faith, within twelve (12) months of the date this Order becomes
final, the Assets To Be Divested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Respondent shall divest the Assets To Be Divested only to an acquirer or acquirers that receive the prior approval
of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The purpose of the divestiture
of the Assets To Be Divested is to ensure the continued use of the Assets To Be Divested as ongoing viable pharmacies
engaged in the same businesses in which the Assets To Be Divested are presently employed and to remedy the lessening

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Pending divestiture of the Assets To Be Divested, Respondent shall take such actions as are necessary to maintain

wasting, deterioration, or impairment of any Assets To Be Divested except for ordinary wear and tear.

(6) months of such repossession. If Respondent has not redivested such assets or interest pursuant to Paragraph II
of this Order within six (6) months of such repossession, the provisions of Paragraph III shall apply to these assets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. If Respondent has not divested, absolutely and in good faith and with the Commission's prior approval, the Assets
To Be Divested within twelve (12) months of the date this Order becomes final, the Commission may appoint a trustee
to divest the Assets To Be Divested. In the event the Commission or the Attorney General brings an action pursuant to
&sect;5(l) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;45(l), or any other statute enforced by the Commission,
Respondent shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a
decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from
seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it, including a court-appointed trustee, pursuant to &sect;5(l)
of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or any other statute enforced by the Commission, for any failure by Respondent
to comply with this Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph III.A. of this Order, Respondent shall
consent to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authority, and responsibilities:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of Respondent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in acquisitions and divestitures. If Respondent
has not opposed, in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten
(10) days after notice by the staff of the Commission to Respondent of the identity of any proposed trustee, Respondent
shall be deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to divest
the Assets To Be Divested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, Respondent shall execute a trust agreement that, subject
to the prior approval of the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, transfers to the
trustee all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to effect the divestiture required by this Order.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission approves the trust agreement described in
Paragraph III.B.3 to accomplish the divestiture, which shall be subject to the prior approval of the Commission.
If, however, at the end of the twelve-month period the trustee has submitted a plan of divestiture or believes that
divestiture can be achieved within a reasonable time, the divestiture period may be extended by the Commission, or
in the case of a court-appointed trustee by the court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, and facilities related to the
Assets To Be Divested, or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may reasonably request. Respondent shall
develop such financial or other information as such trustee may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the trustee.
Respondent shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture. Any
delays in divestiture caused by Respondent shall extend the time for divestiture under this Paragraph in an amount
equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or, for a court-appointed trustee, by the court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract
that is submitted to the Commission subject to Respondent's absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at no
minimum price. The divestiture shall be made in the manner and to the acquirer or acquirers as set out in Paragraph II
of this Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided, however, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
if the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one acquirer, and if the Commission determines to approve more
than one such acquirer, the trustee shall divest to the acquirer or acquirers selected by Respondent from among those
approved by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The trustee shall serve, without bond or other security, at the cost and expense of Respondent, on such reasonable
and customary terms and conditions as the Commission or a court may set. The trustee shall have authority to employ,
at the cost and expense of Respondent, such consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, business
brokers, appraisers, and other representatives and assistants as are reasonably necessary to carry out the trustee's
duties and responsibilities. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the divestiture and all expenses
incurred. After approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account
of the trustee, including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of Respondent
and the trustee's power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part
on a commission arrangement contingent on the trustee's divesting the Assets To Be Divested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Respondent shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
or expenses arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the trustee's duties, and Respondent shall either
defend against such claims or pay the trustee's expenses, including all reasonable fees of counsel and other expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation for, or defense of any such claim, whether or not resulting in any liability,
except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses result from misfeasance, gross
negligence, willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the trustee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute trustee shall be appointed in the same manner
as provided in Paragraph III.A. of this Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Commission or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, the court, may on its own initiative or at the request
of the trustee issue such additional orders or directions as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish the divestiture
required by this Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The trustee shall have no obligation or authority to operate or maintain the Assets To Be Divested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The trustee shall report in writing to Respondent and to the Commission every sixty (60) days concerning the trustee's
efforts to accomplish divestiture.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted provisionally an agreement containing a proposed Consent
Order from Revco D.S., Inc. (``Revco'') under which Revco would divest pharmacy assets in three (3) geographic locations
where it faces limited competition. Revco operates the Revco chain of drug stores.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 31, 1994 Revco and Hook-SupeRx, Inc. (``HSI'') executed an Agreement and Plan or Merger providing for the
acquisition by Revco of all of the voting securities of HSI. The proposed complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition,
if consummated, would constitute a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. &sect;18, and Section
5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. &sect;45, in the market for the sale of prescription drugs in retail stores in
the following towns: Covington, Virginia; Marion, Virginia; and Radford, Virginia (hereinafter ``relevant geographic
area''). The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by maintaining the current number of competitors
in the relevant geographic areas where Revco and HSI are direct competitors and where they face limited competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Consent Order provides that within one (1) year of the Order becoming final, Revco shall divest all assets
related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in Revco or HSI retail stores in the relevant geographic areas. The
divestiture of the Revco or HSI pharmacy business in the relevant geographic areas shall be made only to an acquirer
or acquirers that receive prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of
the Commission. The assets shall be divested to an eligible acquirer or acquirers that will operate a pharmacy business
in the relevant geographic areas. Eligible acquirers in each relevant geographic area include, but are not limited
to: owners of retail stores that currently do not operate a pharmacy in that relevant geographic area; persons previously
employed by Revco or HSI; or persons who will open a new retail store. In the event that Revco has not divested the Revco
or HSI pharmacy assets in the relevant areas in one (1) year, the proposed Consent Order provides that Revco shall consent
to the appointment by the Commission of a trustee to divest the pharmacy assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provisions of the Consent Order, Revco is also required to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance
with the divestiture provisions of the Order within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and
every sixty (60) days thereafter until Revco has completely divested its interest in assets related to the retail
sale of prescription drugs in the relevant geographic areas. The proposed Order will also prohibit Revco, for a period
of ten (10) years, from acquiring, without Federal Trade Commission approval, any stock in any concern engaged in
the business of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas or any assets used for the business
of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Revco will be required to
provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires Revco
to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) day prior to any change in the structure of Revco resulting in the emergence
of a successor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

I. Executive Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1985, Congress mandated that unitary chemical warfare agents be destroyed in such a manner as to provide maximum
protection for the environment, the public, and personnel involved in destroying the agents. The National Center
for Environmental Health (NCEH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was delegated review and oversight
responsibility for any Department of the Army (DA) plans to dispose of or transport chemical weapons (Public Law 91&hyph;121
and 91&hyph;441, Armed Forces Appropriation Authorization of 1970 and 1971).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of its ongoing efforts to improve medical preparedness within the medical sector of civilian communities
surrounding chemical agent depots, CDC has developed the following medical preparedness and response guidelines.
These guidelines represent 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
minimum standards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of medical preparedness for civilian communities that might be exposed to chemical warfare agents during the incineration
or storage process. These guidelines were developed in cooperation with a panel of recognized experts in the fields
of emergency medicine, disaster preparedness, nursing, chemical warfare preparedness, and the prehospital emergency
medical system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1985, Congress mandated that unitary chemical warfare agents be destroyed in such a manner as to provide maximum
protection for the environment, the public, and the personnel involved in destroying the agents. This mandate was
further defined in the Department of Defense (DOD) Authorization Act of 1986, Public Law 99&hyph;145. Consistent
with its desire to promote the most environmentally safe method of destroying chemical agents, the National Research
Council determined that incineration is the best method for disposing of the weapons(1). In 1988, The Authorization
Act was amended to permit DA to set up a prototype incineration facility on Johnston Island in the Pacific in order to
verify the safety of such an operation. To date, more than 700,000 pounds of chemical agent have been safely incinerated
there.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCEH, CDC, was delegated the responsibility of reviewing and overseeing any DA plans to dispose of or transport chemical
weapons (Public Law 91&hyph;121 and 91&hyph;441, Armed Forces Appropriation Authorization of 1970 and 1971). In
addition, an interagency agreement between CDC and DA requires CDC to provide technical assistance to the DA in protecting
the public health in nearby communities during the destruction of unitary chemical agents and weapon systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, large quantities of chemical warfare agents are stored in eight facilities in the continental United
States. These chemical stockpiles consist primarily of nerve agents, mustard agents, or a combination of both. In
Tooele, Utah, construction of the chemical agent incinerator is now complete, and destruction of the weapons and
chemicals in this depot is scheduled to begin in Spring of 1995. To improve the ability of local health care personnel
to handle emergencies related to a chemical agent release, CDC has presented medical preparedness courses to civilian
medical personnel on sites adjacent to the eight chemical weapons depots on 13 occasions. Emergency physicians,
nurses, internists, surgeons, hospital administrators, and prehospital emergency medical responders have attended
these courses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of its ongoing efforts to improve medical readiness in civilian communities surrounding chemical agent depots,
CDC developed medical preparedness and response guidelines. These guidelines represent 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
minimum standards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for medical preparedness in civilian communities that might be inadvertently exposed to chemical warfare agents
during the incineration or storage process. These guidelines were developed in cooperation with a working group
of recognized experts in the fields of emergency medicine, disaster preparedness, nursing, chemical stockpile
emergency preparedness, and prehospital emergency medical systems. These guidelines do not supersede current
medical and public health practices and requirements (e.g., precautions for handling bodily fluids).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following recommendations for civilian community response to the release of a chemical agent are divided into
prehospital and hospital. The recommendations are designed to ensure high quality medical preparedness for chemical
agent emergencies. Appendix A is a summary of important questions to ask when evaluating medical preparedness in
the civilian prehospital and hospital environments. The prehospital environment encompasses all areas outside
both the installation boundaries and the hospital grounds. People potentially affected in the prehospital environment
include the general public, and first responders. First responders include police, sheriff's, and fire department
personnel, hazardous materials response teams, and medical response teams (including emergency medical technicians,
paramedics, and any other medically-trained personnel responding to the site of injury with the ambulance teams).
The hospital environment includes primarily the emergency department but encompasses outside areas which might
be used for triage and decontamination and other hospital departments which might support the hospital's response.

_Transportation of victims to a medical facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chemical protective clothing and respiratory protection enable responders to care for patients exposed to chemicals
while protecting themselves from secondary contamination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that such equipment protects the skin, eyes, and respiratory tracts of the emergency responders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Use DA battledress overgarments (BDOs) and portable air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) with an organic vapor
cartridge to protect civilians from chemical warfare agents. BDOs can be used for up to 24 hours in an agent-contaminated
environment at levels of up to 10 grams of agent per square meter of surface area. Notwithstanding this recommendation,
however, civilian emergency responders should use the equipment with which they are most familiar, providing that
the equipment used is at least as protective as the above CDC recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Train personnel required to use personal protective equipment when responding to chemical agent-related
emergencies in accordance with the guidelines published by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. First Responders
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Ensure that all persons (e.g., medics, paramedics, fire fighters, or medical personnel) designated by the
State or local disaster plans as members of the initial medical team that responds to a chemical warfare agent release
have the appropriate level of PPE and are trained in its proper use (2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that equipment of first responders is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
adequately maintained
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and available at all times.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Schedule regular drills and training sessions designed to maintain first responders' familiarity with equipment
into State and local disaster plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Public
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CDC does not recommend distributing PPE (e.g., gas masks or protective suits) to the public. In the unlikely event
that a chemical agent release threatens the civilian population adjacent to a military facility, CDC recommends
the following graded emergency response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Evacuate the population at risk in accordance with State or local disaster management guidelines. If no local
guidelines exist, follow the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and DA joint guidelines for evacuating
civilian populations threatened by chemical warfare agents (3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Follow FEMA and DA recommendations for sheltering the population in place (e.g., keep people in their homes,
institutions, or places of business and seal windows and doors from an external vapor threat) if it is not practical
to evacuate the population (3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Decontamination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Decontamination is the careful and systematic removal of hazardous substances from victims, equipment, and the
environment. Transporting contaminated patients exposes emergency response personnel to chemical warfare agents
and contaminates rescue vehicles. Proper decontamination prevents secondary contamination and chemical injury
to medical and rescue personnel. Acceptable decontamination guidelines for persons who may possibly have been exposed
to chemical warfare agents are published by FEMA and DA (3,4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Decontamination of patients can be achieved by mechanically removing, diluting, absorbing, or neutralizing
the chemical agent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Decontaminate all persons who may possibly have been contaminated with a chemical warfare agent before they
are transported to a hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Decontamination substances should be readily available. Suitable decontamination substances include
soap, water, and 5% hypochlorite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To protect the environment, include in State and local disaster plans a method for containing and disposing
of contaminated runoff. CDC does not recommend establishing fixed decontamination units in prehospital areas because
of the expense and inflexibility of such units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Level of Medical Preparedness Training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
At a minimum, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
train persons designated as prehospital medical responders in evaluating patients exposed to chemical warfare
agents, managing patients' airways (excluding intubation), transporting patients, and decontaminating patients.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Train prehospital responders who have been designated in State or local disaster plans to operate in environments
contaminated by a chemical warfare agent in the proper use of PPE in accordance with OSHA guidelines (2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
at a minimum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, physicians who have been designated in State and local disaster plans to provide medical supervision for prehospital
emergency responders and medical care for victims of a chemical agent release receive specialized training through
continuing education in the emergency response areas specified for prehospital responders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Patient Triage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The basic premise of patient triage, to provide maximum benefit to the greatest number of victims, is of utmost
importance during a mass-casualty event involving chemical agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have the most experienced responder conduct triage operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Base decisions regarding patient triage on local resources, the extent of patient contamination, the type
of chemical warfare agent to which the patient is exposed, the patient's clinical status, and the likelihood of additional
traumatic injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Public Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Inform the public appropriately, accurately, and rapidly about chemical agent exposures that have or may
have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Establish, through the local emergency medical services (EMS) and hospital community, a coordinated public
information policy for chemical emergencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Contact local and regional news media in advance to establish an accurate and rapid way of disseminating critical
information to the public concerning a chemical agent emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that hospital and EMS personnel coordinate their plans to provide public information with the plans
of those who have overall responsibility for emergency response. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Communication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Medical personnel must have access to the emergency communication network 24 hours a day. Such a network should link
the chemical agent depot, local and regional EMS, and all potential receiving hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have medical personnel demonstrate the ability to access the emergency communications network during any
evaluation of preparedness for a chemical warfare release into civilian communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that the hospitals' emergency communications system allows hospital personnel to verify rapidly
whether a chemical warfare agent release has occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Transporting Exposed Victims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Coordinate the transportation of chemical agent-exposed victims with the overall disaster response plan,
and include a method for tracking transported patients during an emergency response. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Transport patients only after they have been properly decontaminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Transport decontaminated patients to medical facilities (e.g., hospitals, clinics, and urgent care centers).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Formal agreements such as memorandums of understanding (MOUs) between organizations that transport patients
and the medical facilities that receive them must be part of the planning process. Medical facilities designated
to receive should be capable of evaluating and managing patients exposed to chemical agents as described later in
the hospital section (Section IV) of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Base decisions regarding urgent and emergency transfers of decontaminated patients on the capabilities
of the receiving facilities, transportation resources, demand for hospital services, and the clinical condition
of the patients. Certain medical care (e.g., for burns, pediatric emergencies, trauma, or pulmonary complications)
might require prearrangements for patients to be transferred to a tertiary treatment center. CDC recommends that
transfer and evacuation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
plans 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for victims exposed to chemical warfare agents call for land_rather than air_transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

10. Medical Evaluation and Treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Train medical response personnel specifically to assess and manage patients exposed to chemical agents stored
at the nearby military depot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Decontaminate all exposed patients as described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Provide medical treatment (during or after contamination), according to accepted treatment modalities,
to patients exposed to nerve or mustard agents. If antidotes to nerve agents are used in the field by civilian medical
responders as designated in State or local disaster plans, CDC recommends using single-dose, pre-armed autoinjectors,
unless a higher level of medical response has already been integrated into EMS operations. Additional information
on the effects of chemical warfare agents and accepted medical protocols for caring for patients exposed to mustard
or nerve agents is available (5&hyph;14).

IV. Recommendations for Hospital Preparedness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Primary Receiving Hospitals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A primary receiving hospital is a hospital that is designated by State or local disaster plans to provide initial medical
care to the civilian population in the event of a chemical warfare agent release. Such hospitals must have established
protocols detailing evaluation, decontamination, and treatment procedures for patients exposed to chemical warfare
agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Include evaluation, treatment, and decontamination protocols in the hospitals' disaster plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Include chemical warfare agent scenarios in disaster drills for hospitals that have been designated in State
or local disaster plans to receive patients exposed to chemical warfare agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Triage Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Do 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 allow patients exposed to a chemical warfare agent to enter the emergency department without adequate evaluation
and decontamination. Signs of mustard agent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure, in particular, may require 24&hyph;48 hours before they become clinically evident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Train medical staff designated by the hospital disaster plan to perform triage during an emergency related
to chemical warfare agents to recognize the physical signs and symptoms of patients who have been exposed to such agents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Base modifications to patient triage procedures on the extent of patient contamination, the type of chemical
warfare agent to which the patient has been exposed, the patient's clinical status, and the possibility of additional
traumatic injuries. Priorities for medical treatment of patients should be determined by the most appropriately
trained and experienced medical professional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Address issues related to emergency department security during disasters in the hospital disaster plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Restrict access to the hospital to prevent contaminated patients from entering the hospital. During a chemical
agent release, security personnel should direct all patients to enter the hospital only through the triage area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Decontamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Decontaminate all persons who may have been contaminated with a chemical warfare agent. Proper decontamination
prevents secondary contamination and chemical injury to medical and rescue personnel. Acceptable decontamination
guidelines for persons exposed to chemical warfare agents are published by FEMA and DA (3,4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have decontamination substances readily available. Suitable decontamination substances include soap,
water, and 5% hypochlorite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In the hospital disaster plan, detail a method for catching contaminated runoff from patients whether decontamination
is done inside or outside the hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
At a minimum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, be capable of decontaminating at least one nonambulatory patient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;During and after chemical agent releases that cause mass casualties, decontaminate patients outdoors. Having
indoor decontamination facilities does not obviate a hospital's need to have plans for decontaminating patients
outdoors during mass casualty situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Design hospital disaster plans, keeping in mind the possibility of integrating local emergency response
resources. Such resources could include hazardous materials emergency response teams or portable decontamination
vehicles or facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In cold weather, set up temporary shelters and heaters to protect patients from extreme environmental conditions
when undergoing decontamination outdoors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have in place a method of controlling the flow of air in the decontamination area to prevent such air from contaminating
other areas of the hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Set up a system to allow medical personnel in the decontamination area to be in continuous communication with
other medical personnel in the emergency department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chemical protective clothing and respiratory protection enable responders to care for chemically exposed patients
while protecting themselves from secondary contamination. This equipment must protect the skin, eyes, and respiratory
tracts of the responders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Use DA BDOs and PAPRs with organic vapor cartridges to protect civilian personnel against chemical warfare
agents. The BDO can be used in an agent-contaminated environment for up to 24 hours at contamination levels of up to
10 grams of agent per square meter of surface area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have hospital personnel follow Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) guidelines when managing patients exposed to unknown chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have hospital emergency responders use the equipment with which they are most familiar, providing that such
equipment is at least as protective as the equipment recommended by CDC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Train response personnel to use PPE when responding to a chemical agent emergency according to OSHA guidelines
(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Level of Training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Train medical staff designated by the hospital disaster plan to provide direct patient care during a chemical
warfare agent emergency to a level of medical preparedness that allows them to assess, decontaminate, and manage
the treatment of victims of chemical warfare agent releases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Medical staff who are required to wear decontamination attire in decontamination procedures must receive
training in the use of PPE according to OSHA regulations (2&hyph;4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Transportation of Patients to Other Medical Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Have prearranged written agreements with those medical facilities that agree to accept patients who are exposed
to military chemical agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Do not transfer patients without notifying the hospital and having the patient accepted by a physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have standardized forms available to record patient information and management status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Specific Antidotes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Have decontaminating solutions available in the emergency department. If nerve agents are stored adjacent
to the civilian community, have atropine in multiple-dose units available in the emergency department and in the
hospital pharmacy. In addition, have the hospital pharmacy stock atropine and pralidoxime in sufficient quantities
to cope with the anticipated number of patients who could be managed by that facility in response to a chemical warfare
agent release. Atropine and pralidoxime should be administered intravenously in the emergency environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Hospital Disaster Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Include plans for providing medical care for patients exposed to chemical agents in the hospital's disaster
plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have in place a method for using the emergency communication system so that reports of a chemical warfare agent
release can be verified rapidly. Also include provisions to coordinate activities with State and local disaster
plans for mass decontamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Include in disaster drills scenarios in which patients have become exposed to chemical warfare agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Use the hospital quality assurance program to review disaster drills and decontamination procedures and
to assist in maintaining the professional skills of hospital personnel necessary to treat the effects of exposure
to a chemical warfare agent.

10. Tertiary Hospitals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A tertiary receiving hospital is a hospital that receives referrals from primary receiving hospitals. Additional
services such as burn care, psychiatric service, and toxicologic consultation are available at the level of care.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that tertiary hospitals designated by State or local disaster plans to provide care for persons exposed
to chemical warfare agents have, at a minimum, emergency response capabilities similar to those of the primary receiving
hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that tertiary hospitals coordinate their disaster plans with State and local disaster plans for mass
decontamination of persons exposed to chemical warfare agents.

Appendix A Summary of Important Medical Preparedness Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Communities Surrounding Chemical Agent Stockpiles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Do the communities that surround chemical warfare agent depots have a disaster plan that details the role of the
prehospital and hospital medical community during a chemical warfare agent emergency? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If medical personnel are designated to treat chemical warfare agent casualties, do they have adequate training
to meet minimal standards for evaluating, decontaminating, and treating victims of a chemical warfare agent release?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Do medical personnel who are designated by State, local, and hospital disaster plans to use PPE in response to an
emergency related to chemical warfare agents have the necessary OSHA level of training to use these devices effectively
and safely? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If the local disaster plan has provisions to evacuate or transfer patients to other hospitals for further treatment
and evaluation, do existing MOUs cover the transfer of chemically contaminated patients? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Do hospitals named in the State or local disaster plans have an adequate stockpile of antidotes and decontamination
solutions to provide complete medical treatment to at least one chemically contaminated patient? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Are hospitals named in the State or local disaster plans able to decontaminate at least one nonambulatory patient
exposed to chemical warfare agent? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Do the disaster plans of hospitals named to receive patients by State and local disaster plans have specific provisions
which detail how they will control access to their medical facilities during a chemical warfare agent emergency?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Are all levels of the medical community that are designated by State or local disaster plans to respond to a chemical
warfare agent emergency able to communicate via either the State or local disaster communication network?

Open committee discussion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In April 1992, the Generic Drugs Advisory Committee met to consider methods for documenting the bioequivalence
of topical corticosteroids. Subsequently, on July 1, 1992, the Office of Generic Drugs issued a guidance document
entitled ``Interim Guidance for Topical Corticosteroids: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In Vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Bioequivalence and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In Vitro
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Release Methods.'' The purpose of the September 1994 meeting is to reexamine the 1992 interim guidance in light of
new experimental data and methods of analysis. On September 12, 1994, the committee will discuss the pharmacodynamic
(i.e., vasoconstrictor) measurement of bioequivalence. On September 13, 1994, this topic will be further discussed
along with other issues related to the documentation of equivalence according to the interim guidance. Discussion
will be limited to dermatologic products and will not include ophthalmic or inhaled corticosteroid products. Also,
on September 13, 1994, there will be a review of the current status of topics discussed at previous Generic Drugs advisory
committee meetings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA public advisory committee meetings may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public hearing, (2)
an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation. Every advisory
committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of the other three
portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. There are no closed portions for the meetings announced
in this notice. The dates and times reserved for the open portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Through a review of elk habitat management in the Wells Resource Area, it was determined that elk numbers and habitat
use areas are expanding from those identified in the Wells RMP Record of Decision, approved July 16, 1985. Elk are recognized
as highly adaptable creatures and during recent years have pioneered to adjacent previously unoccupied habitats
in the Wells Resource Area from the Pilot Mountain Management Area, northwestern Utah and southern Idaho. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this amendment is to establish elk habitat management areas, identify habitat requirements and specific
management objectives and practices, establish target elk population management levels, develop factors for attainment
and future adjustments in elk population management levels, and identify constraints on other resources within
the Wells Resource Area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Restoring an endangered or threatened plant or animal to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe site specific management actions considered necessary for conservation and survival
of the species, establish objective, measurable criteria for recovery levels for downlisting or delisting species,
and estimate time and cost for implementing recovery measures needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), requires development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote conservation of
a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988 requires that public notice and an opportunity for
public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other Federal
agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Texas trailing phlox is an endangered species known from one site on private land in Tyler County and one population
in Hardin County located mostly on land owned by The Nature Conservancy, with a few plants occurring on adjoining roadside
rights-of-way and private property. The plant is restricted to sandy soils in open pine woodlands. Texas trailing
phlox is threatened primarily by habitat loss due to canopy closure, encroachment of hardwood trees, and soil disturbance
associated with human activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Texas trailing phlox recovery plan has been reviewed by the appropriate Service staff in Region 2. The plan will
be finalized and approved following incorporation of comments and materials received during this comment period.

to import giant pandas. The purpose for which the permit is requested has now been modified to focus on scientific research
investigating olfactory communication and how it relates to giant panda reproductive physiology and sexual behavior
and habitat use. In addition, a female captive-born panda has now been substituted for the female wild-caught animal
identified in the initial import request.

Consolidation Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241&hyph;1421 has filed a petition
to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(2) (weekly examination) to its Blacksville No. 2 Mine (I.D. No. 46&hyph;01968)
located in Monongalia County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof and rib conditions in certain areas of the
return air course, traveling the entire area would be unsafe. The petitioner proposes to establish check points 1
and 2 to monitor the methane and quantity of air in the affected area; to have a qualified person conduct these tests
weekly at each check point and record the results in a book kept on the surface and made available for inspection by interested
persons; and to install a door in the overcast on the mainline track haulage in order to observe the mine roof over the
overcast once a day to determine whether a roof fall and possible collapse of the overcast exists. The petitioner asserts
that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

Drummond Company, Inc., P.O. Box 10246, Birmingham, Alabama 35202 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.800 (high-voltage circuits; circuit breakers) to its Shoal Creek Mine (I.D. No. 01&hyph;02901) located
in Jefferson County, Alabama. The petitioner requests a modification of that portion of the standard that pertains
to under-voltage, grounded phase, overcurrent, and ground check opening the circuit breaker. The petitioner proposes
to use high-voltage contactors with an electrical rating adequate for the connected load; to use under-voltage,
overload, grounded phase, and ground check protective devices that would de-energize the high-voltage contactor;
to use a control circuit design for each high-voltage circuit that would preclude automatic closing of the high-voltage
contactor when there is an under-voltage, overload, grounded phase, or ground check problem; to use a control circuit
design for each high-voltage contactor that would preclude remote closing of the high-voltage contactor when there
is an overload, grounded phase, or ground check problem; and to use a short circuit current that would trip the high-voltage
circuit breaker, and a control circuit design that would preclude automatic or remote closing of the high-voltage
circuit breaker. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure
of protection as would the mandatory standard.

Dynamic Recovery, Inc., P.O. Box 25, Clarksville, Pennsylvania 15322 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.1103&hyph;4(a) (automatic fire sensor and warning device systems; installation; minimum requirements)
to its Lazarus Mine (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08336) located in Greene County, West Virginia. The petitioner proposes to
install a low-level carbon monoxide detection system as an early warning fire detection system in all belt entries
where a monitoring system would identify a sensor location instead of in each belt flight. The petitioner asserts
that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory
standard.

petitioner propose to load each hole as soon as it has been drilled, then move to the next hole, continue until the end
of the shift, and then continue loading on subsequent shifts until the pattern is completed. Then, the round would
be wired and shot as soon as possible. The petitioner states that returning to the collapsed holes to redrill would
cause hazardous conditions. In addition, the petitioner states that the proposed alternate method would prevent
a diminution of safety.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notices were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have complied with the requirements
of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for a hearing, unless otherwise stated,
were received by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.

Proposed Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is
granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406(b) (1) and (2) of the Act shall not apply to the purchase of certain
real property (the Property) by the Plan from Pipefitters Local 195 of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices
of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry (the Union), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, provided that the
following conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. An independent fiduciary determines that the proposed transaction is in the best interests of the Plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The fair market value of the Property is established by an appraiser unrelated to the Plan or the Union; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Plan pays no more than the lesser of $462,800 or the fair market value of the Property as determined at the time
of purchase; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The purchase is a one-time transaction for cash; and

Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Plan is an apprenticeship training plan established and administered pursuant to the provisions of section
302 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. As of January 31, 1994, the Plan had 580 participants and total assets
of $1,248,499. On the same date, the number of employers contributing to the Plan totaled 21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Property consists of 2.74 acres of land and improvements located adjacent to property of the Union. The improvements
include three one and two-story buildings, constructed by the Union in 1968 and 1978, designed for use as classroom
and apprenticeship training facilities for the Plan and its participants. From 1968 to 1988 the Plan operated an apprenticeship
program on the Property pursuant to a lease of the Property by the Union to the Plan.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In August 1988 the Union sold the Property to the Plan. The Plan partially financed this purchase by obtaining a loan
from the Sabine Area Pipefitters Local 195 Pension Trust Fund (Local 195 Pension Plan). The Local 195 Pension Plan,
which was later merged into the Plumbers and Pipefitters National Pension Fund, had interlocking trustees with the
Plan and the Plan made some contributions to the Local 195 Pension Plan on behalf of its participants. The loan was repaid
in June 1991.

Prohibited transaction exemption (PTE) 78&hyph;5 (43 FR 23024, May 30, 1978) permits, under certain conditions,
the leasing of real property by an apprenticeship plan from a sponsoring employee organization. The Department expresses
no opinion as to whether the above lease satisfied the conditions of PTE 78&hyph;5 nor is any relief provided herein.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In September 1990 the Department commenced an investigation of the Plan regarding the sale of the Property by the Union
to the Plan and the loan between the Plan and the Local 195 Pension Plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Also, an application for exemption for retroactive relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of the Act
was submitted to the Department for these transactions. In a letter in January 1992, the Department cited as reasons
for denying the exemption application, among other factors, the lack of the review and prior approval of the transactions
by an independent fiduciary. Following this exemption denial, an agreement was reached with the Department which
required that the Property be sold back by the Plan to the Union. Such sale occurred in December 1992. Since that date,
the Plan has utilized the Property as a training facility without charge from the Union. However, the applicant represents
that because of an economic downturn in the area, the Union considers it a hardship to continue this arrangement.

The above described transactions may have constituted prohibited transactions under section 406 of the Act. Such
section prohibits, in part, a sale or exchange of property between a plan and a party in interest, a use of plan assets
for the benefit of a party in interest, and the acting of a fiduciary in a plan transaction on behalf of a party whose interests
are adverse to those of the plan or its participants.

3. The applicant obtained an appraisal on the Property on January 14, 1994, from Donnie M. Jones, MAI (Jones), a real
estate appraiser located in Port Arthur, Texas. Jones represents that he is not related in any way to the Plan or the
Union. Utilizing the income, cost and sales comparison approaches to value, Jones estimated that the Property had
a fair market value of $462,800 as of the date of the appraisal. By letter dated March 1, 1994, Jones stated that he was
aware, in preparing the appraisal, that the Plan was the prospective buyer of the Property and that this knowledge
had no influence on his calculation of value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Plan now proposes to purchase the Property from the Union so that the Plan itself will own the training and educational
facilities used to train journeymen and apprentices. Plan fiduciaries note that ownership of the Property will give
the Plan full control of the buildings, grounds and parking lots and will enable the Plan to make improvements to the
Property as needed. The Plan will pay no more than current fair market value for the Property, as established by an updated
independent appraisal. The purchase will be a one-time transaction for cash and the Plan will pay no fees or commissions
in regard to the purchase. The applicant represents that, after the purchase of the Property, the Plan will have more
than enough funds for operational purposes of the training program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Plan and the Union have selected Joseph P. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Connors, Sr. (Connors), an attorney with the firm of Connors Associates, Inc. in Washington, D.C. to serve as independent
fiduciary in regard to the proposed transaction. The applicant represents that Connors is independent of the Plan
and the Union.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Connors states that he has had extensive experience working with Taft-Hartley plans, including serving as chairman
of funds of the United Mine Workers. Connors further states that he is well aware that while acting as independent fiduciary
he assumes personal liability and he must act solely in the interest of the Plan and its participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Connors maintains that the proposed transaction is definitely in the best interests of the Plan. In this regard, Connors
has met with officers of the Union and trustees of the Plan and has made an inspection of the Property with Russell Allen,
the training director for the Plan. The Plan has operated an apprenticeship program utilizing the Property since
the initial time of construction in 1968. As independent fiduciary, Connors will make certain that the Plan pays no
more than fair market value for the Property and will enforce all rights of the Plan in regard to the proposed transaction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria of section
408(a) of the Act because: (1) the purchase of the Property will give the Plan ownership of the facilities it uses for
its apprenticeship training program; (2) an independent fiduciary has determined that the proposed transaction
is in the best interests of the Plan and its participants; (3) the Plan will pay no more than fair market value for the
Property, based on an updated independent appraisal; (4) the purchase will be a one-time transaction for cash; and
(5) the Plan will pay no fees or commissions in regard to the transaction.

General Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

Proposed Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of section
406(a), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the
Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the proposed cash sale (the Sale)
of certain shares of stock (the Shares) from certain individually-directed accounts in the Plan (the Accounts) to
Lewis-Gale Clinic, Inc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the Clinic), a party in interest with respect to the Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed exemption is conditioned on the following requirements: (1) the terms and conditions of the Sale are
at least as favorable to the Accounts as those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party;
(2) the Sale is a one-time cash transaction; (3) the Accounts are not required to pay any commissions, costs or other
expenses in connection with the Sale; (4) the Sales price for the Shares is based upon its fair market value as determined
by a qualified, independent appraiser; and (5) within ninety days of the grant of this proposed exemption, the Clinic
files Forms 5330 with the Internal Revenue Service and pay all applicable excise taxes due with respect to past prohibited
transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Plan is a profit sharing plan sponsored by the Clinic, a Virginia professional corporation owned exclusively
by licensed physicians engaged in the practice of medicine. The Clinic employs 837 full-time and part-time employees
of which 124 are licensed physicians. The Clinic services the Greater Roanoke Valley with a central location located
in Salem, Virginia. The Clinic also operates various satellite clinics in towns and counties within a fifty mile radius
of its primary location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. As of March 31, 1994, the Plan had total assets of $58,733,461 and 690 participants. The Plan permits each participant
to direct the investments of his or her account among several funds including a fund commonly referred to as Fund F.
First Union National Bank of Virginia (First Union) serves as trustee of all Plan assets except those held in Fund F.
The board of directors of the Clinic serves as the trustee with respect to the Plan assets held in Fund F. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Fund F is designed to be invested exclusively in the common stock of the Lewis-Gale Building Corporation (the Building
Corporation), which was incorporated on December 22, 1970. From the time of such incorporation until 1983, all of
the outstanding common stock of the Building Corporation (the Stock) was owned exclusively by the physicians and
certain administrative personnel. The primary purpose of the Building Corporation is to own and operate certain
real property facilities which are leased to the Clinic and other health care providers for use in rendering medical
services.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clinic represents that the Building Corporation is a real estate operating company within the meaning of 29 CFR
2510.3&hyph;101(e). Therefore, with regard to any ownership by the Plan, the Building Corporation's assets are
not considered plan assets. However, the Department expresses no opinion as to whether the underlying assets of the
Building Corporation contain plan assets under 29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;101(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. As a condition to employment, each physician is contractually required to purchase a fixed dollar amount of the
Stock. In 1983, the Building Corporation and the physicians, upon the advice of counsel, amended the Plan and the pre-existing
stock restriction agreement to permit the Plan to acquire the Stock, thereby allowing the physicians to satisfy their
contractual obligations to purchase the Stock by self-directing portions of their individual account balances
into Fund F.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department notes that the decisions of the fiduciaries on behalf of the Plan, in connection with the acquisition
and holding of the Building Corporation Stock are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of Part
4, Subpart B of Title I. In this regard, the Department herein is not proposing relief for any violations of Part 4 of
the Act which may have arisen as a result of the investment in and subsequent holding of the Stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Stock is not publicly traded, the Building Corporation values the Stock on an annual basis using its historic
valuation formula under the existing stock purchase agreement between the Building Corporation and its shareholders.
The valuation formula incorporates the fair market values of the underlying assets of the Building Corporation,
which are valued annually by a qualified, independent real estate appraiser. The Building Corporation has consistently
utilized this valuation formula to set the price per share for all sale and purchase transactions involving the Stock.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fund F has experienced an average annual rate of return of 11.3 percent, and investment in this fund is open to all participants
in the Plan. As of May 11, 1994, Fund F held 16,413 shares (the Shares) of the Stock which represents approximately eighty-two
percent of the issued and outstanding shares of the Stock. The remaining issued and outstanding shares of the Stock
are owned by physicians and certain administrators. The terms of Fund F require a participant electing to invest in
Stock to remain invested in Fund F until his or her death, disability, retirement or other termination of employment.
Upon such occurrences, a number of shares of the Stock equal to the value of such participant's Fund F account balance
will be sold back to the Building Corporation for cash and such cash proceeds distributed to the participant as a part
of his or her Plan account balance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Between 1988 and 1990, thirteen physicians (the Physicians), upon the advice of counsel, sold their individual
shares of the Stock for cash to their individually-directed accounts in the Plan indirectly through the Building
Corporation. Three of the Physicians were officers of the Clinic. The Clinic states that, as an indirect result of
these sales, some of the accounts of the Physicians held shares of the Stock in excess of twenty-five percent of the
balance of their account at some point. Because of the party in interest/ disqualified person relationships and the
past purchases by the accounts from the Physicians, the Clinic is aware of the fact that prohibited transactions have
occurred in violation of the Act. Accordingly, the Clinic represents that within ninety days of the grant of this proposed
exemption, the Clinic will file Forms 5330 with the Internal Revenue Service and will pay all applicable excise taxes
due with respect to past prohibited transactions.

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the administrative difficulties involved in locating certain Physicians who were involved in these prohibited
purchases by their accounts, the Clinic has represented that it will be responsible for the filing of the Forms 5330
and the payment of all applicable excise taxes resulting from these prohibited purchases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Upon discovering that certain accounts in the Plan had engaged in prohibited transactions, the board of directors,
acting as trustee, froze the assets in Fund F pending resolution of the prohibited transaction issues. As a result,
retiring participants are limited to receiving only a partial distribution. In order to allow participants to receive
full distributions, the trustee proposes to sell the Shares to the Clinic. Accordingly, the Clinic requests an administrative
exemption from the Department to permit the Sale under the terms and conditions described herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Sale will be a one time cash transaction, and the Accounts will pay no fees or commissions in connection with the
Sale. Prior to the Sale, First Union will become trustee with respect to the Plan assets in Fund F. At this time, First
Union will have the sole investment discretion over the entire assets of the Plan. Although the initial decision to
sell the Shares was made by the board of directors acting as trustee, First Union will have the ultimate authority to
approve or disapprove the terms and conditions of the Sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Clinic obtained an appraisal of the Stock dated May 13, 1994, from Dianne D. Cobb, CFA, ASA. Ms. Cobb is the Senior
Vice President of Investment Managements Services of Wachovia Bank of North Carolina which provides analysis with
regard to non-publicly traded securities and securities of closely held businesses. Ms. Cobb represents that both
she and Wachovia Bank of North Carolina are unrelated to and independent of the Clinic and its affiliates. Relying
upon the discounted future cash flow and recent trades of the Stock, Ms. Cobb placed the fair market value of the Stock
at $764 per share. Based on this valuation, the value of the Shares, which represent Fund F's eighty-two percent interest
in the Building Corporation, total $12,539,532. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption
under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the terms and conditions of the Sale will be at least as favorable to the
Plan as those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) the Sale will be a one-time cash
transaction; (c) the Plan will not be required to pay any commissions, costs or other expenses in connection with the
Sale; and (d) the Sales price for the Shares will be based upon its fair market value as determined by a qualified, independent
appraiser; and (e) within ninety days of the grant of this proposed exemption, the Clinic will file Forms 5330 with
the Internal Revenue Service and will pay all applicable excise taxes due with respect to past prohibited transactions.

Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Raytech is a multi-national manufacturer and marketer of specialty engineered products for heat resistant, inertia
control, energy absorption and transmission applications. In 1988, Raytech became the sponsor of the Plans, which
are defined contribution plans under section 401(k) of the Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Salaried Plan currently has 281 participants and beneficiaries, and has assets with an approximate aggregate
fair market value of $9,793,000. The Hourly Plan currently has 236 participants and beneficiaries, and has assets
with an approximate aggregate fair market value of $1,051,000. Effective January 1, 1994, Charles Schwab Trust Company
(the Trustee) was appointed as trustee to the Plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Investments of funds contributed under the Plans are made by the Trustee as directed by participants in accordance
with provisions of the Plans. In 1988, the Plans provided two investment options: (i) a ``Guaranteed Interest Fund''
in which the monies were to be held under a contract or contracts issued by one or more major insurance companies providing
for a stipulated minimum rate of interest, as selected by the Plans' administrative committee (the Committee) or
(ii) a ``Managed Securities Fund'', consisting of a mutual fund managed by a bank which was selected by the Committee.
Under the provisions of the Salaried Plan, Raytech's matching contributions could be delivered in cash or Raytech
common stock at the direction of Raytech's Board of Directors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In 1992, both Plans were amended, revising the name of the Equity Fund from ``Managed Security Fund'' to ``Equity
Fund'', and the Salaried Plan was amended to add an additional investment option in a Balanced Fund as selected by the
Committee. In 1993, both Plans were amended to change the Guaranteed Interest Fund option. Prior to this amendment,
the Guaranteed Interest Fund provided for monies contributed in a particular year to be held by a single insurance
company (e.g., ELIC). Pursuant to this amendment, the Plans now permit investments in a ``pooled investment fund''
that features insurance company contracts issued by multiple insurance companies. Under the terms of each of the
Plans, the participants have withdrawal and transfer rights with respect to their accounts (Withdrawal Events).
The circumstances triggering Withdrawal Events include severance from service, disability, retirement, death,
hardship, transfer of funds and loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The GIC was issued by ELIC to the Plans in 1988. Employee savings contributions directed to the Guaranteed Interest
Fund and related Raytech contributions were invested in the GIC during 1988. As of April 11, 1991, total principal
deposited under the GIC plus accumulated interest under the GIC, less previous withdrawals (the Accumulated Book
Value) for the Plans amounted to $1,774,779. On April 11, 1991 (the Conservation Date), ELIC was seized by the California
Insurance Commissioner and its assets were frozen and its payments suspended, including the GIC.

 Effective September 3, 1993 (the Closing Date), the California Superior Court approved a rehabilitation/liquidation
plan (the Rehab Plan).
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The Rehab Plan provides for the resolution of ELIC's contractual obligations.

 Civil Action No. 5:92CV 614 (EBB). The suit named Raytech as a successor in liability to Raymark. The suit alleged the
breach of fiduciary duties under the Act in connection with the purchase of a group annuity contract from ELIC to fund
the benefits of three Raymark pension plans following an investigation that began in June, 1991. The Department notes
that the exemption proposed herein is not intended to affect any cause of action by any participant of the Plans or the
Department with respect to the GIC.

6. Pursuant to the Rehab Plan, an interim benefit payment (the Interim Payment) was received by the Plans in the combined
amount of $288,528 in September, 1993. In January, 1994, the Plans were provided an option to elect to participate
in the Rehab Plan or to opt out. Notice was given that the contract values and terms of the original GIC had been adjusted
down as required by the Rehab Plan. The Plans were advised that there was no participating state guaranty association,
and thus no such source of makeup funds. The Plans' Committees elected to opt out of the Rehab Plan, and the GIC was surrendered
(see rep. 8, below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Under the Rehab Plan, a new insurance company, Aurora, was created to receive the ELIC assets. ELIC contractholders,
however, were not forced to invest in the new company and could opt out. Upon opting out, however, the ELIC contractholders
were to receive only a portion of their Accumulated Book Value, or a reduction of 31.5%. After that reduction, further
amounts were to be held back to cover potential liabilities from ELIC indemnities in the sale of the assets and ongoing
litigation concerning allocation of the ELIC assets, leaving the balance for the first opt out payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the first opt out payment, the Rehab Plan provides for future potential payments as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) distributions from enhancement trusts; and (b) release of holdbacks. These are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three enhancement trusts were created at the ELIC sale to protect certain ELIC assets that were not part of the sale,
one for real estate, one for below grade stocks and bonds, and one for ELIC rights not transferred. All of these assets
are to be liquidated by the enhancement trusts over time and the proceeds distributed to the ELIC contractholders.
As required by the Rehab Plan, a specified amount was held back to cover the indemnity and allocation contingencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The holdback amounts, if any remain, will be released to the participants in the future if not used to cover the indemnities
and allocation litigation result. The Rehab Plan provided no assurance that there would be distributions from enhancement
trusts or releases of holdbacks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The opt out provision of the Rehab Plan was equivalent to a repurchase of the GIC in return for the opt out payment.
Having elected to opt out, the Plans on March 27, 1994, received the first opt out payment in the amount of $730,912.
When added to the Interim Payment (see rep. 6, above) of $288,528, the Plans have received a total of $1,019,440 from
ELIC. In addition, approximately $200,000 was held back by ELIC (see rep. 7, above). When the opt out payment was received,
the Plans surrendered the GIC to Aurora. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Following the receipt of the first opt out payment and assuming no future payments from the enhancement trusts or
from the holdback, each affected participant in the Plans will have lost approximately 42% of his/her account balance
invested in the GIC as of the Conservation Date of April 11, 1991. The applicant represents that the realization of
these losses and uncertainties surrounding the ELIC situation have caused substantial concern and anxiety among
the Plans' participants. In order to relieve the affected participants' concerns, to protect the participants'
accounts invested in the GIC, and to restore to the Plans the ability to fulfill obligations with respect to Withdrawal
Events involving amounts invested in the GIC, Raytech desires to make up the losses the participants have suffered
as a result of the investment in the GIC by way of the Makeup Payments. The Makeup Payments have been calculated as follows:

The totals that should have been earned match the payments made by ELIC (Interim Payment plus first opt out payment)
plus the Makeup Payment. (The totals will increase to account for interest at 6.19% up to the actual Makeup Payment
date.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Makeup Payments, which are shown in the above chart, have been calculated in order to restore to the Plans the full
Accumulated Book Value of the GIC as of March 27, 1994 (the date of the first opt out payment), which is $2,261,278. In
addition, the applicant represents that it will pay interest to the Plans up to the actual Makeup Payment date at a rate
of 6.19%, since funds invested in the GIC would have been rolled over by the Trustee into the Hartford Insurance Company
GIC, having a guaranteed interest rate of 6.19% and expiring December 31, 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Raytech is prepared and able to contribute the above-calculated Makeup Payments plus interest to the Plans to
eliminate the participants' losses and future payment contingencies. The first opt out payments (including the
Interim Payment) and the Raytech Makeup Payments will fully restore the participants' accounts. Immediately following
the granting of the exemption proposed herein and the execution of a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service
pursuant to Rev. Proc. 92&hyph;16, the Makeup Payment will be contributed directly to the Trustee, who is obligated
under the terms of the Plans to invest the contribution directly into the Guaranteed Interest Fund. As future payments
from the enhancement trusts or return of holdbacks are received, the Trustee is to pay such amounts over to Raytech
to reimburse it for that portion of the Makeup Payments. The transaction can be characterized as a non-interest bearing
loan by Raytech to the Plans requiring no security or collateralization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The applicant represents that the losses suffered by the affected participants are known numbers since the Rehab
Plan has been implemented and the payment has been made except for enhancement trusts and holdbacks. In the absence
of the Makeup Payments, such participants stand to lose 42% of their account balances as of the Conservation Date of
April 11, 1991 and interest since such date totaling approximately $1,242,000. To summarize, Raytech is proposing
to make up the lost amounts and to cover the amounts not paid due to the enhancement trusts and the holdbacks under the
Rehab Plan. Raytech is looking to recoup such amounts only to the extent that they are subsequently paid under the Rehab
Plan.

12. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactions will satisfy the criteria contained in section
408(a) of the Act because: (a) all terms of the transactions will be no less favorable to the Plans than those which the
Plans could obtain in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) no interest and/or expenses will be
paid by the plans; (c) the Makeup Payments will be made only in lieu of payments due from ELIC with respect to the accumulated
book value of the GIC at the time of the Makeup Payments; (d) the Repayments are restricted to the GIC Proceeds; (e) the
Repayments will not exceed the total amount of the Makeup Payments; and (f) the Repayments are waived to the extent
the Makeup Payments exceed the GIC Proceeds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August

Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Employer is a Delaware Corporation with its principal place of business located in Chicago, Illinois. The Plans
are all defined contribution plans. The estimated number of participants in each of the Plans as of December 31, 1993
is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Bally's Employee Savings Trust for Administrative Employees: 729 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Bally's Employees Savings Trust for Club Employees: 4,775

e. The Amended and Restated Bally's Park Place, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan: 2,162 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The assets of all five Plans are held in the Master Trust. Each Plan holds units of participation representing an
undivided interest in the assets of the Master Trust. As of December 31, 1993, the total amount of Plan assets held in
the Master Trust was approximately $95,000,000. The terms of the Plans permit participants to direct the investment
of their accounts under the Plans. Each of the Plans provides its participants the option of investing in any of six
mutual funds managed by Fidelity Management and Research Company, including the Interest Income Fund. The GICs,
which were acquired directly by the Master Trust, are considered part of the Interest Income Fund. The Interest Income
Fund has investments in several guaranteed investment contracts. On April 4, 1989, the Master Trust acquired GIC
A (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CGO 1318 A3A) from Executive Life for $4,000,000. GIC A provided for annual, guaranteed interest at the rate of 10.13%,
with a maturity date of October 15, 1992. On July 3, 1989, the Master Trust acquired GIC B (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CGO 1331 A3A) from Executive Life for $3,000,000. GIC B provided for annual guaranteed interest at the rate of 9.01%,
with a maturity date of October 15, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On April 11, 1991, Executive Life was placed into conservatorship by the Insurance Commissioner of the State of
California. The Employer represents that Executive Life ceased payments on the GICs upon commencement of the conservatorship.
The effect of the conservatorship has been to freeze all assets invested in the GICs. This freeze has prevented Plan
participants from exercising their rights under the Plans to request distributions, loans, withdrawals and investment
transfers with respect to amounts currently invested in the GICs.

4. The Employer proposes to make the Advances to the Master Trust in a series of payments, pursuant to a written loan
agreement (the Agreement). The total amount of Advances will not exceed the aggregate account balances of the Plans'
participants attributable to the GICs as of April 11, 1991,

 The Employer represents that it wishes to enter into the proposed transaction in order to protect the Plan participants
from the effects of a prolonged rehabilitation process and from any potential loss resulting from Executive Life's
inability to meet its obligations under the GICs. In this regard, the Employer represents that the Plans' participants
will benefit from the proposed transaction because the Advances will ensure that the participants receive 100% of
the conservatorship date value of their accounts and such amounts will be available as soon as approval is received
from the Internal Revenue Service and the Department.

 The Employer further represents that the Advances will facilitate benefit distributions, loans, hardship withdrawals
and investment transfers which would not otherwise be possible because of Executive Life's suspension of payments
under the GICs. The Employer also represents that the Advances will be non-interest bearing and the Plan will not incur
any expenses in connection with the proposed transaction.

5. Repayment of the Advances under the Agreement is limited to payments made to the Master Trust by or on behalf of Executive
Life, or its successor, or any other responsible third parties. No other assets of the Master Trust will be available
for repayment of the Advances. If the payments by or on behalf of Executive Life are not sufficient to fully repay the
Advances, the Agreement provides that the Employer will have no recourse against the Plans or the Master Trust, or
against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plans, for the unpaid amount. To the extent the Master Trust receives
GIC proceeds in excess of the total amount of the Advances, such additional amounts will be retained by the Master Trust
and allocated among the accounts of the Plans' participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act because: (1) The transaction will preserve the Plans' ability to timely fund participants' benefits, including
participant loans, hardship withdrawals and participant-directed investment re-allocations; (2) The Master
Trust will not incur any expenses with respect to the transaction; (3) Repayment of the Advances will be made only from
amounts paid to the Master Trust by Executive Life, its successor, or any other third party; (4) If the payments by or
on behalf of Executive Life are not sufficient to fully repay the Advances, the Employer will have no recourse against
the Plans or the Master Trust, or against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plans, for the unpaid amount; and
(5) Repayment of the Advances will be waived with respect to the amount by which the Advances exceed the amount the Master
Trust receives from GIC proceeds.

General Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

University of Washington; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact Regarding
Proposed Renewal of Facility License No. R&hyph;73 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility License
No. R&hyph;73 for the University of Washington Research Reactor (the licensee) located on the University campus
in Seattle, Washington.

Identification of Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Environmental Assessment is written in connection with the proposed renewal date of February 14, 1999, for the
facility license of the University of Washington Research Reactor (UWRR) at Seattle, Washington, in response to
a timely application from the licensee dated August 10 and 31, 1989, as modified on February 14 and May 2, 1994. The proposed
action would authorize possession, but not operation, of the facility, for a period of five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Need for the Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The license for the facility was due to expire on October 13, 1989. The licensee made a timely request for renewal as
a possession only license on August 10 and 31, 1989, for a period of 20 years which was later modified on February 14,
1994 for a period of five years. The proposed action is required to authorize continued possession, but not operation,
of the facility, so that the licensee can complete its decommissioning plan and ultimately decommission the reactor
facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Possession Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An alternative to the proposed action that was considered was not renewing the license. This alternative would have
led to possession of a facility and radioactive material without authorization by law. This alternative did not provide
an acceptable way for the licensee to possess the facility prior to decomissioning, or for decommissioning the facility
in a controlled, coordinated manner. The other alternative was to renew the license for possession only a period of
one year, but this would require license renewals on an annual basis until decommissioning is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reactor is defueled and all special nuclear material and source material have been shipped offsite or transferred
to the State license. The only remaining radioactivity at the facility is activated reactor components. There is
no potential for generation of further radioactive materials. The extension of the facility license as a possession
only license for a five year period allows the licensee time to complete its decommissioning plan and affords it a reasonable
time to implement decommissioning. Further, providing additional time for the licensee to develop and implement
the decommissioning plan should lessen the environmental impact, in that radioactive materials will continue to
be depleted by the decay process and the licensee will have an opportunity to better plan and conduct decommissioning
activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives Use of Resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of any resources beyond those normally allocated for such activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies and Persons Consulted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission has concluded that the propose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has
determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for this proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's request for a license renewal application dated
August 10 and 31, 1989, as modified on February 14 and May 2, 1994. These documents are available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 30, 1994, the Commission approved a final rule revising 10 CFR Part 73 associated with protection against malevolent
use of vehicles at nuclear power plants. The rule change modifies the design basis threat for radiological sabotage
to include use of a land vehicle. The rule change also requires vehicle control measures, including vehicle barrier
systems, to protect against the malevolent use of a land vehicle. The vehicle barrier system design requires that
the system stop the forward motion of the design basis vehicle.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the implementation of this rule change, the NRC staff is publishing Regulatory Guide 5.68, ``Protection
Against Malevolent Use of Vehicles at Nuclear Power Plants,'' and NUREG/CR&hyph;6190, ``Protection Against Malevolent
Use of Vehicles at Nuclear Power Plants,'' Volumes 1 and 2. These documents were specifically developed to provide
guidance acceptable to the NRC staff by which a licensee can meet the requirements of the revised 10 CFR Part 73. The
Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation will conduct one-day technical workshops in each of the NRC Regional offices
to discuss Regulatory Guide 5.68 and NUREG/CR&hyph;6190, Volumes 1 and 2, and address implementation of the rule
change.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NRC regulations for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in a geologic repository
recognize that prohibit designing the repository against the effects of such a potentially adverse condition. The
STP recognizes the acceptability of designing the geologic repository to take into account the attendant effects
(e.g., displacement) of faults of regulatory concern and express the staff's views on what is needed from the U.S.
Department of Energy if it chooses to locate structures, systems, and components important to safety or important
to waste isolation in areas that contain faults of regulatory concern.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of its regulations to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;53 and DPR&hyph;69, issued to Baltimore Gas and Electric
Company (the licensee), for operation of the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located in Calvert
County, Maryland.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application dated March 23, 1994, for an exemption from certain
requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power plant
reactors against radiological sabotage.'' The requested exemption would allow the implementation of a hand geometry
biometric system of site access control in conjunction with photograph identification badges, and would allow the
badges to be taken offsite.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55(a), the licensee is required to establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system
and security organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' specifies in part that: ``The licensee
shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' The Code of Federal Regulations
at 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), specifies in part that: ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for
all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' It further indicates that an individual
not employed by the licensee (e.g., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without an escort provided
the individual, ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit
from the protected area.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, unescorted access for both employee and contractor personnel into the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant,
Unit Nos. 1 and 2, is controlled through the use of picture badges. Positive identification of personnel who are authorized
and request access into the protected area is established by security personnel making a visual comparison of the
individual requesting access and that individual's picture badge. The picture badges are issued, stored, and retrieved
at the entrance/exit location to the protected area. These picture badges are not taken offsite. This current practice
is in accordance with the applicable requirements of 10 CFR Part 73 discussed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need
to issue and retrieve picture badges at the entrance/exit location to the protected area. The proposal would also
allow all individuals, including contractors, who have unescorted access to keep their picture badges in their possession
when departing the Calvert Cliffs site. Thus, an exemption is required from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) to allow contractors
who have unescorted access to keep their picture badges in their possession when departing the Calvert Cliffs site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action. In addition to their picture badges, all individuals
with authorized unescorted access will have the physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) registered
with their picture badge number in a computerized access control system. Therefore, all authorized individuals
must not only have their picture badges to gain access into the protected area, but must also have their hand geometry
confirmed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other access processes, including search function capability and access revocation, will remain the same. A
security officer responsible for access control will continue to be positioned within a bullet-resistant structure.
The proposed system is only for individuals with authorized unescorted access and will not be used for individuals
requiring escorts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The underlying purpose for requiring that individuals not employed by the licensee must receive and return their
picture badges at the entrance/exit is to provide reasonable assurance that the access badges could not be compromised
or stolen with a resulting risk that an unauthorized individual could potentially enter the protected area. Although
the proposed exemption will allow individuals to take their picture badges offsite, the proposed measures require
not only that the picture badge be provided for access to the protected area, but also that verification of the hand
geometry registered with the badge be performed as discussed above. Thus, the proposed system provides an identity
verification process that is equivalent to the existing process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the exemption to allow individuals not employed by the licensee to take
their picture badges offsite will not result in an increase in the risk that an unauthorized individual could potentially
enter the protected area. Consequently, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological impacts
associated with the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed exemption does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Accordingly,
the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with
the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the proposed action would be to deny the requested action. Denial of the requested action would not significantly
enhance the environment in that the proposed action will result in a process that is equivalent to the existing identification
verification process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternate Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the April 1973 Final Environmental
Statement for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff consulted with the State of Maryland, Department of Natural Resources, regarding the environmental
impact of this proposed action. The State official had no comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's letter dated March 23, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,

On May 4, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The rule change amends Sections 1(b) and 1(c) to Article III of the NASD By-Laws and Schedule C to the By-Laws to clarify
the process by which an applicant applies for membership in the NASD.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD amended the proposed rule change three times subsequent to its original filing on March 11, 1994. The first
amendment changed the requirement that an applicant for membership in the NASD submit a copy of its ``current submission
to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 15b1&hyph;2(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934''
to require that the applicant submit ``Form BD filed with the Central Registration Depository.'' This amendment
is technical in nature in that it corrects a deficiency that arose out of the 1992 amendments to the broker-dealer registration
process which deleted Rule 15b1&hyph;2(c) and requires that Form BD be submitted to the NASD.

registration and reporting requirements).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second amendment reflected the results of the NASD membership vote concerning the NASD's proposed rule change.
The change was submitted to a vote of the NASD membership in NASD

by a vote of 1,879 in favor, 161 opposed, and 6 not voting out of 2,046 ballots received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the third amendment provided minor wording changes to Schedule C of the Schedules to the By-Laws, Part I,
Section 2(f) and further clarified the NASD's basis for proposing certain other changes; this amendment was technical
in nature and did not have any substantive impact.

The NASD seeks to amend its By-Laws and Rules with respect to the procedural aspects of the membership application
process. The NASD has identified instances where its By-Laws and rules are inconsistent and where its actual practices
are inconsistent with its rules. This rule change corrects these aberrations and further clarifies the membership
application process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD By-Laws currently provide that any application for membership shall be referred to the District Committee
of the NASD district in which the applicant has its principal place of business. The By-Laws further provide that the
appropriate District Committee shall determine whether the applicant satisfies the NASD's admission requirements.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In contrast, the NASD's rules, Schedule C to the By-Laws, provide that the District Office staff initially determine
an applicant's eligibility for membership. The rules do, however, further set forth procedures for review by the
District Committee, upon request by the applicant, of the District Office's determination.

According to the NASD, the actual practice is for the appropriate District Committee to determine an applicant's
eligibility for membership. The NASD has determined to amend its By-Laws and Schedule C to allow each District Committee
to designate a Subcommittee to act, under limited circumstances, on behalf of the District Committee. The proposed
rule change, therefore, amends the NASD By-Laws and Schedule C to provide that all initial applications for membership
be reviewed by either the District Committee or a Subcommittee of the District Committee, with a right of appeal to
the full District Committee.

The NASD has also amended the By-Laws by deleting the explicit requirement that determinations of the District Committee
(and now Subcommittees designated by the District Committee) be made by a majority of its members. The NASD indicated
that it removed this requirement because it believes that the requirement that a determination be made by a vote presumes
that the vote will be a majority of the members of the District Committee or Subcommittee designated by the District
Committee. File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;14, Amendment No. 3.

II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined to approve the NASD's proposal. The Commission believes that the rule change is consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD, including the requirements
of Section 15A(b)(8) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 Section 15A(b)(8) requires, in part, that the rules of the NASD be designed to provide a fair procedure concerning
the denial of membership in the NASD and prohibiting or limiting access to services of the NASD.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule change clarifies the NASD's membership application process by eliminating the inconsistencies between
the NASD's by-Laws and the Schedules to the By-Laws concerning the administration of this process. In addition, this
rule change clarifies the procedures set forth in the Schedules to the By-Laws for accepting, denying or accepting
with limitations an application for membership.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conclusion, for the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the rule change is designed to provide a fair
procedure concerning the denial of membership in the NASD and prohibiting or limiting access to services of the NASD.
The Commission therefore finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. &sect;78s(b)(1), notice
is hereby given that on May 12, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amex proposes to amend Rule 205 (Manner of Executing Odd-Lot Orders) (1) to provide that no differential shall
be charged on odd-lot order transactions (except for non-regular way trades); (2) to revise provisions relating
to the price at which certain odd-lot limit orders shall be executed, and (3) to delete, reposition or re-number various
provisions relating to specific types of odd-lot orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex and at the Commission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set
forth in Section A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 205 relating to the execution of odd-lot orders (1) to eliminate the odd-lot differential
for market and limit orders; (2) amend provisions relating to the price at which odd-lot limit orders are executed;
and (3) delete, reposition or re-number various provisions relating to specific types of odd-lot orders in Rule 205,
Section B.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current Exchange rules, market odd-lot orders to buy or sell, as well as marketable limit orders, are executed
with no differential charged.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 However, a differential may be charged in connection with executions of odd-lot limit orders, market orders to sell
marked ``short,'' stop orders, and other types of orders (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
orders to buy or sell ``at the close''). In order to enhance the competitiveness of Exchange odd-lot execution procedures,
the Exchange has determined to require the execution of all odd-lot market or limit orders (except for non-regular
way executions under proposed Section C(2) of the rule) without a differential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<FOOTNAME>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Procedures for executing odd-lot market orders are currently being implemented on a pilot basis, extended until
August 8, 1994. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33584 (February 7, 1994), 59 FR 6983 (February 14, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 205, Section A(2) would require that limited orders to buy (sell) be executed at the price of the first round lot
transaction which is at or below (above) the specified limit price (the ``effective transaction'' price). Sell limited
orders marked ``short'' would be executed at the price of the first round lot transaction which is at or above the specified
limit and which is also higher than the last different round lot transaction price (a ``plus'' or ``zero-plus'' tick).
Marketable limit orders would continue to be executed in accordance with procedures applicable to market orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions relating to orders that are infrequently or never entered (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
limited orders to buy an offer, sell on bid, ``immediate or cancel''; buy or sell marked ``or on close'') would be deleted.
Provisions relating to ``seller's option'' or cash trades in Section C would be deleted and subsumed by new Section
C(2) (Non-Regular Way Trades). A differential could be charged on such executions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change will advance the objectives of Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives
of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in
regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities,
and in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

December 15, 1986, applicant registered under section 8(a) of the Act and filed a registration statement under section
8(b) of the Act and the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement was declared effective and applicant commenced
its initial public offering on May 8, 1987.

Purchase Agreement, Key Trust would acquire substantially all of the assets of First Albany related to the management
of applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Consummation of the Asset Purchase Agreement was conditioned upon applicant's Board of Directors approving the
plan of reorganization described below. On January 10, 1994, applicant's Board of Directors approved a plan of reorganization
whereby applicant agreed to transfer substantially all of its assets and certain of its liabilities to the Victory
Fund for Income Portfolio (the ``Acquiring Fund''), a newly-created series of The Victory Fund in exchange for shares

value per share of $9.78.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. As of April 30, 1994, applicant transferred substantially all of its assets and certain of it liabilities of the
Acquiring Fund in exchange for full and fractional shares of the Acquiring Fund. Each of applicant's shareholders
received as a liquidating distribution shares of the Acquiring Fund in the same dollar amount as the shares of applicant
held by such shareholder immediately prior to the effective date of the reorganization, plus the right to receive
any unpaid dividends or distributions declared before the effective date of the reorganization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The cost of preparing, filing, and distributing registration and proxy materials necessary to obtain shareholder
approval of the reorganization was borne by the Acquiring Fund's and applicant's managers. No cost of the reorganization
was borne by applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. As of the date of the application, applicant had retained $5,777 in cash to pay its remaining liabilities. Applicant
has no shareholders. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not presently

of its affairs.

1. SIT Mutual Funds, Inc., SIT Mutual Funds II, Inc., SIT Growth Fund, Inc., SIT Growth &amp; Income Fund, Inc., SIT
U.S. Government Securities Fund, Inc., and SIT Money Market Fund, Inc. (collectively, the ``SIT Group'') are open-end
management investment companies. The SIT Group currently offers eleven series (each a ``Fund''). One of the Funds
is a money market fund subject to the requirements of rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act (together with any future money market
portfolios, the ``Money Market Funds''). The other ten Funds are non-money markets funds (together with any future
non-money market funds, the ``Non-Money Market Funds'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. SIT Investment is the investment adviser for the SIT Group. Sit/Kim International Investment Associates, Inc.
serves as sub-adviser for two of the Funds (together with SIT Investment and any future sub-adviser to a Fund, the ``Investment
Advisers.'' SIA Securities Corp. serves as principal underwriter for the Funds. Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. serves
as transfer agent and custodian to the Funds. At the present time, each of the Funds is offered without any sales charge,
redemption fee, or rule 12b&hyph;1 or shareholder servicing fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Money Market Funds seek current income, liquidity, and capital preservation by investing exclusively in short-term
money market instruments, such as U.S. government securities, bank obligations, commercial paper, municipal obligations,
or repurchase agreements secured by government securities. These short-term debt securities are valued at their
amortized cost pursuant to the requirements of rule 2a&hyph;7. The Non-Money Market Funds invest in a variety of debt
and/or equity securities in accordance with their respective investment objectives and policies. Each of the Funds
has, or may be expected to have, uninvested cash in an account with the custodian. This cash either may be invested directly
in individual short-term money market instruments or may not be otherwise invested in any portfolio securities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Applicants seek the ability for (a) the Funds to utilize their cash reserves that have not been invested in portfolio
securities to purchase shares of the Money Market Funds (each Fund, including Money Market Funds, purchasing shares
of the Money Market Funds is an ``Investing Fund'') and (b) the Money Market Funds to sell or redeem their shares to or
from each Investing Fund. By investing cash balances in the Money Market Funds as proposed, applicants believe that
the Investing Fund will be able to combine their cash balances and thereby (a) reduce their transaction costs, since
transaction costs currently incurred by the Investing Funds in connection with the short term investment of their
uninvested cash would be avoided; (b) create more liquidity; (c) enjoy greater returns; and (d) further diversify
their holdings. The policies of the Funds either permit or will be amended (pursuant to shareholder vote if required)
to permit the Funds to purchase money market instruments, including shares of a Money Market Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The shareholders of the Investing Funds would not be subject to the imposition of double management fees. Applicants
would cause each Investment Adviser and its respective affiliates to remit to the respective Investing Funds or waive
investment advisory and any other fees these service providers earn as a result of the Investing Funds' investments
in the Money Market Funds to the extent the fees are based upon the Investing Funds' assets invested in shares of the
Money Market Funds. Further, no sales charge, contingent deferred sales charge, 12b&hyph;1 fee, or other underwriting
or distribution fee would be charged by the Money Market Funds with respect to the purchase or redemption of their shares.
If a Money Market Fund offers more than one class of shares, each Investing Fund will invest only in the class with the
lowest expense ratio at the time of the investment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Several of the Funds have contractual or voluntary expense cap arrangements with SIT Investment for the purpose
of keeping each Fund's total expenses below a certain predetermined percentage amount (``Expense Waiver''). To
the extent actual expenses of the Funds exceed these caps, SIT Investment waives its advisory fee or reimburses a Fund
in the amount of the excess. Any applicable Expense Waiver will not limit the advisory and other fee waiver or remittance
discussed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicants also request relief that would permit the Funds to invest uninvested cash in a Money Market Fund in excess
of the percentage limitations set out in section 12(d)(A)(ii) of the Act. Section 12(d)(A)(ii) prohibits a registered
investment company from acquiring the securities of another investment company if, immediately thereafter, the
acquiring company would have more than 5% of its total assets invested in the securities of the selling company. Applicants
propose that each Fund be permitted to invest in shares of a single Money Market Fund so long as each Fund's aggregate
investment in such Money Market Fund does not exceed the greater of 5% of such Fund's total net assets or $2.5 million.
Applicants will comply with all other provisions of section 12(d)(1).

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Sections 17(a)(1) and (2) of the Act make it unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment company,
or any affiliated person of such affiliated person, acting as principal, to sell or purchase any security to or from
such investment company, Because each Fund may be deemed to be under common control with the other Funds, it may be an
``affiliated person,'' as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the other Funds. Accordingly, the sale of shares
of the Money Market Funds to the Investing Funds, and the redemption of such shares from the Investing Funds, would
be prohibited under section 17(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a transaction from section 17(a) if the terms of the
proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve
overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered
investment company concerned, and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general policy of the Act. Section
17(b) could be interpreted to exempt only a single transaction. However, the Commission, under section 6(c) of the
Act, may exempt a series of transactions that otherwise would be prohibited by section 17(a).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Investing Funds will retain their ability to invest their cash balances directly into money market instruments
if they believe they can obtain a higher return. Each of the Money Market Funds has the right to discontinue selling
shares to any of the Investing Funds if its board of trustees determines that such sales would adversely affect the
portfolio management and operations of such Money Market Fund. Therefore, applicants believe that the proposal
satisfies the standards for relief.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder prohibit an affiliated person of an investment company,
acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise
or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates. Each Investing Fund, by purchasing shares of
the Money Market Funds; each Investment Adviser of an Investing Fund, by managing the assets of the Investing Funds
invested in the Money Market Funds; and each of the Money Market Funds, by selling shares to the Investing Funds, could
be participants in a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement within the meaning of section 17(d)(1) and rule 17d&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Rule 17d&hyph;1 permits the Commission to approve a proposed joint transaction covered by the terms of section
17(d). In determining whether to approve a transaction, the Commission is to consider whether the proposed transaction
is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which the participation of
the investment companies is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other participants. Applicants
believe that the proposal satisfies these standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Section 12(d)(1), as noted above, sets certain limits on an investment company's ability to invest in the shares
of another investment company. The perceived abuses section 12(d)(1) sought to address include undue influence
by an acquiring fund over the management of an acquired fund, layering of fees, and complex structures. Applicants
believe that none of these concerns are presented by the proposed transactions and that the proposed transactions
meet the section 6(c) standards for relief.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Shares of the Money Market Funds sold to and redeemed from the Investing Funds will not be subject to a sales load,
redemption fee, or distribution fee under a plan adopted in accordance with rule 12b&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants will cause the Investment Advisers and their respective affiliates, in their capacities as service
providers for the Money Market Funds, to remit to the respective Investing Fund or waive an amount equal to all fees
received by them or their affiliates under their respective agreements with the Money Market Funds to the extent such
fees are based upon the Investing Fund's assets invested in shares of the Money Market Funds. Any of these fees remitted
or waived will not be subject to recoupment by the Funds' Investment Advisers or their respective affiliates at a later
date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. For the purpose of determining any amount to be waived and/or expenses to be borne to comply with any Expense Waiver,
the adjusted fees for an Investing Fund (gross fees minus Expense Waiver) will be calculated without reference to
the amounts waived or remitted pursuant to condition 2. Adjusted fees then will be reduced by the amount waived pursuant
to condition 2. If the amount waived pursuant to condition 2 exceeds adjusted fees, the Investing Fund's Investment
Adviser also will reimburse the Investing Fund in an amount equal to such excess.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each of the Investing Funds will be permitted to invest uninvested cash in, and hold shares of, a Money Market Fund
only to the extent that the Investing Fund's aggregate investment in such Money Market Fund does not exceed the greater
of 5% of the Investing Fund's total net assets or $2.5 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Investing Funds will vote their shares of each of the Money Market Funds in the same proportion as the votes of
all other shareholders in such Money Market Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Investing Funds will receive dividends and bear their proportionate shares of expenses on the same basis as
other shareholders of such Money Market Funds. A separate account will be established in the shareholder records
of each of the Money Market Funds for each of the acquiring Investing Funds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sterling Electronics Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on July 13, 1994
and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its common stock on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market for the common stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before August 11, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been
made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the
protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the
application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Small Business Administration (SBA) is issuing notice to advise the public it is implementing a new revolving
line of credit loan guaranty program on a national basis to be called the GreenLine Revolving Line of Credit Loan Guaranty
Program (GreenLine). This program authorizes SBA to use its guaranty authority to provide the Agency's full faith
and credit support to loans made by approved lenders that finance the short term, cyclical working capital needs of
small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The establishment of GreenLine is in response to information obtained over a two year period demonstrating the need
for a nationwide revolving line of credit loan guaranty program. Many lenders acknowledged that this type of financing
was generally available in the commercial marketplace to only larger businesses with a need for larger lines of credit.
Small businesses would require the guaranty from SBA in order for lenders to provide them with the same opportunity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GreenLine shall serve as the umbrella for all the Agency's short term lending programs with the exception of the Export
Revolving Line of Credit (ERLC) and the Export Co-Guaranty programs. Under GreenLine, authority to provide a revolving
feature to the Agency's traditional Contract, Seasonal, and Contractors loan programs is added.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The predecessor for this program was tested on a pilot basis in selected local markets beginning on October 1, 1992
when SBA began piloting two revolving line of credit loan programs. Both Programs were designed to assist small business
in obtaining cyclical working capital financing through the authority of SBA's 7(a) guaranty loan program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first pilot, called the Green Line Revolving Line of Credit Program (GRLC), was implemented in the Agency's South
East and South Central Regions, while the second, called the Domestic Revolving Line of Credit Program (DRLC) was
tested in all SBA Regions not served by the Green Line pilot. The predominant distinction between the programs dealt
with the maximum maturity permitted on the loans: GRLC loans had a maturity of up to five years, while the DRLC loans
had a maturity of only one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Case files were collected from field offices active in the two pilot programs which were reviewed in order to determine
the creditworthiness of the businesses seeking this financing, as well as to identify various terms and conditions
which would be prudent for inclusion in the new loan program's approval documents. The reviews and program formation
meetings also revealed that the new program would need servicing guidelines designed to provide maximum assurances
that the line would revolve and the losses minimized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since October 1, 1992, 531 loans have been approved under the GRLC pilot for a total of $130.0 million, while for the
same period, 327 loans have been approved under the DRLC pilot for a total of $71.0 million. It is important to note that
this volume of GRLC activity was generated in only two regions, while the DRLC volume was generated in eight. This activity
indicated that a much keener interest exists for the extended terms available under Pilot GRLC than under the Pilot
DRLC Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this program, advances will generally be made against a borrower's certified level of inventory and accounts
receivable, while repayment will be derived from the sale of that inventory and the collection of any resulting accounts
receivable. Participating lenders will be expected to monitor the disbursements of funds from the line and control
the payment of funds back to the line. Primary collateral will consist of a senior lien position on the assets being
financed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SBA will consider all applications submitted by approved GreenLine lenders which seek up to a 75% SBA guaranty of the
GreenLine financing, not to exceed $750,000. Lender's desiring to participate need to complete a Lender's Qualification
Survey which can be obtained from their local SBA District Office. The processing of GreenLine applications can only
be done by SBA personnel from offices which have completed SBA sponsored training, and received approval from SBA's
Office of Financial Assistance (OFA). Training material has been developed and the training schedule set. Once the
staff in a field office completes the required training, and is designated by OFA, it will be eligible to process GreenLine
applications received from approved participating lenders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All field offices which have processed either GRLC or DRLC loans under the respective regional pilots will continue
to be able to accept and process these loans under their existing pilot guidelines until training has been offered
to their office by the SBA Associate Administrator for Financial Assistance (AA/FA), but in no event later than August
30, 1994. After this date, offices will only be able to accept GreenLine applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional Fees Permitted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recognition of the additional servicing and monitoring required to adequately protect the interest of the lender
and SBA, the Agency is temporarily waiving its limitations on service related fees in order to permit the lender to
offset the costs associated with increased servicing required to prudently monitor the lines, and to provide a program
that relates to the lending practices of the private sector.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of SBA's Regulations presently in effect relative to 7(a) guaranteed business loans (see 13 CFR, paragraphs 120
and 122) will also govern the implementation of GreenLine, provided, however, that the limitation on processing
and servicing fees as found in &sect;&sect;120.104&hyph;2(a)(3) and 120.104&hyph;2(e) of SBA regulations (13
CFR 120.104&hyph;2(a)(3) and 120.104&hyph;2(e)) will be waived for a maximum two year pilot period. Notice of this
pilot is issued pursuant to &sect;120.1&hyph;2 of SBA regulations (13 CFR 120.1&hyph;2). In addition, SBA will ascertain
whether this type of loan can be sold on the secondary market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA will require that participating lenders fully disclose to both the borrower and SBA the fees they intend to charge
the borrower, and that the borrower acknowledge these fees in writing to the lender and SBA prior to the time the guaranty
of the loan is authorized by SBA, and every six months thereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA is waiving the fee restriction for GreenLine for up to two years provided the Lender charges their SBA supported
borrowers the same fees and charges for services they would normally charge their non-SBA borrowers with similar
types of revolving lines of credit for similar services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Outside Servicing Contractors Permitted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
GreenLine will require a greater servicing effort by lenders than the Agency's other business loan programs and two
existing pilot programs. SBA recognizes that the extent of these servicing requirements may potentially inhibit
the willingness of small community-based, rural, and independent banks from participating in the program. This
may, in turn, have the undesirable effect of limiting access of creditworthy small businesses to the program in the
areas serviced by such lenders. Therefore, the Agency is authorizing lenders to contract out for the servicing functions
they do not perform themselves. Contracting does not relieve the lender of its responsibilities contained in SBA
Form 750 (or 750 B) or any individual loan authorization issued by SBA. The lenders will be held responsible by SBA for
the activities of their contractors. Every contractor must meet the minimum requirements, as specified below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assure that each GreenLine maintains its revolving feature, lenders agree to make initial and periodic examinations
of the borrower's current assets which serve as collateral and forms the basis for disbursements. Lenders also agree
to continually monitor the financial data and control of the cash generated by the borrower as a result of their having
the use of the GreenLine proceeds. At a minimum, a borrower's generated cash must go to an operating account where the
business can not make withdrawals without the concurrence of the Lender.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering the volatility of the collateral securing revolving lines of credit, lenders shall agree as a condition
for approval that they will liquidate a GreenLine borrower's current assets prior to seeking SBA's purchase of any
guaranty.

Minimum Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following standards have been formulated as guidelines for lenders participating in SBA's GreenLine Program
for use when evaluating and selecting an outside or third party service provider (Provider) who may perform those
examination, monitoring, or control functions required to prudently administer GreenLine loans guaranteed by
the SBA: Experience; Competence; Character; Equal Opportunity; Financial Responsibility; Coverage; Business
Authorities; and Confirmation. These standards are numerically arranged from 1 to 8. Those standards noted by an
``a'' after the number are required for lender approval of Providers who will perform examination services. The standards
noted with a ``b'' are required for lender approval of Providers who will perform monitoring or control services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lender shall have the responsibility for providing the required examination, monitoring, or control functions.
Under this program, the lender may contract with a Provider who meets these standards to assist the lender with the
examination, monitoring, or control functions. SBA takes no position on the approvability or quality of any Provider.

Privacy Act of 1974; Creation of Two New Systems of Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that the Department of State proposes to create two new systems of records, STATE&hyph;59 and
STATE&hyph;60, pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(r)) and the Office
of Management and Budget Circular No. A&hyph;130, Appendix I. The Department's report was filed with the Office of
Management and Budget on July 11, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These systems principally support the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration's role in the processing of
applicants for the U.S. refugee program and the initial reception and placement in the United States of those who are
selected. The Refugee Case Records contain information about applicants for the United States refugee program.
The Refugee Data Center Processing Records contain information on applicants for the U.S. refugee program that is
used by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to determine their eligibility for the U.S. refugee program.
The Refugee Data Center Processing Records contain information on applicants for the U.S. refugee program which
is used in the initial reception and placement of persons admitted to the U.S. as refugees and to assist in the collection
of refugee travel loans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any persons interested in commenting on these proposed systems of records may do so by submitting comments in writing
to Margaret P. Grafeld, Chief, Privacy, Plans, and Appeals Division, Office of Freedom of Information, Privacy and
Classification Review, Room 1239, Department of State, 2201 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20520&hyph;1239. These
systems of records will be effective 40 days from the date of publication, (September 6, 1994), unless we receive comments
which will result in a contrary determination. The proposed systems, ``Refugee Case Records, STATE&hyph;59'' and
``The Refugee Data Center Processing Records, STATE&hyph;60'' will read as set forth below.

BACKGROUND: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 24, 1994, representatives of the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a new Agreement for
Transitional Arrangements for Air Transport Services. Under provisions of this Agreement, scheduled combination
services are subject to seasonal frequency limitations. For the upcoming winter season, U.S. scheduled combination
carriers may operate a total of 253 weekly round-trip frequencies for U.S.-Germany (third/fourth freedom) services
and 120 weekly round-trip frequencies for Germany-third country (fifth freedom) services.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agreement further provides that thirty days prior to each traffic season, each Party shall notify the other Party
through diplomatic channels of the initial allocation of the frequencies among its airlines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Article 6, Section 1 (A)(1) provides that airlines designated by the United States may operate 106 weekly round-trip
fifth freedom frequencies during the upcoming winter season. Furthermore, under the Section 1 (A)(2), an additional
14 weekly round-trip fifth freedom frequencies are available provided that the United/Lufthansa rights in the London-Germany
market noted in Appendix B to the Agreement have been effectuated. Since United and Lufthansa are operating these
services, the additional 14 frequencies are available to U.S. carriers this winter season.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By this notice, we invite interested U.S. carriers to apply for the two available designations and available frequencies
for operation of third-country code-sharing services in the U.S.-Germany market for the period November 1, 1994&hyph;October

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 24, 1994, representatives of the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a new Agreement for
Transitional Arrangements for Air Transport Services (Agreement). Under the provisions of this Agreement, for
the period November 1, 1994&hyph;October 31, 1996, two U.S. carriers may be designated to serve Germany pursuant
to code-share arrangements with two airlines of third countries.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In holding out these services each airline may serve a single point in the respective intermediate country, and no
two airlines designated by the same Party may serve the same intermediate point. In addition, these operations are
limited to a total of 1428 weekly one-way frequencies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. previously was entitled to authorize only one carrier to operate on a third-country code-share basis for
U.S.-Germany services. Northwest Airlines has been designated for this service since November 1993. When Northwest
was last authorized (March 24, 1994) to use the third-country code-share designation, it had requested that its designation
be effective through October 31, 1995. The Department, in extending Northwest's designation through this summer
season (i.e., October 31, 1994), deferred on a decision concerning which carriers would be authorized to use available
rights after November 1, and stated that further procedures regarding these designations would be announced at a
later date.

 Northwest currently has an undocketed application on file for this designation for the period through October 31,
1995. By this notice, however, we are extending the period for which the authorization will be effective pursuant
to the terms within the new Agreement. Therefore, rather than supplementing its previous application, we will require
Northwest to file a new application in the established docket following the requirements set forth in this notice.
Northwest is free to attach and incorporate by reference its previous application for this designation. In addition,
since Northwest is the only carrier that has used the third-country code-share opportunity, we will require that
its application also contain the following information regarding its operations since November 1, 1993: (a) a statement
of number of flights previously allocated, (b) the markets served and frequencies per market and period of operation
for each market and (c) the aircraft types used for each market.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, in cooperation with the Alabama Department of Transportation, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) on a proposal to improve a segment of U.S. Highway 431 in Barbour County, Alabama. The purpose of the proposed
project is to provide a safe, efficient, cost-effective, multi-lane facility, capable of handling existing and
future traffic demands. The EIS will evaluate the realigning of a portion of U.S. 431 to function as a bypass around
the City of Eufaula, Alabama. The proposed project will begin on U.S. Highway 431, south of the City of Eufaula near
Cheneghatchee Creek.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The route will extend to the northeast, passing around the City, and terminating with the intersection of U.S. 431
near Hoboken. The length of the proposal is approximately 6.4 kilometers (4 miles). Alternatives under consideration
include: (1) alternate route locations, (2) taking no action, and (3) postponing the action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies and private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have an interest in
this proposal. A public involvement meeting and a public hearing will be held in the City of Eufaula. Public notice
will be given of the time and the place of the meeting and hearing. No formal scoping meeting is planned at this time.

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Alabama Department of Transportation, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) on a proposal to improve a segment of U.S. Highway 80 in Lee, Macon, and Russell Counties, Alabama. The proposed
project begins at Interstate Highway 85 (I&hyph;85) and extends to the east for approximately 58 kilometers (36 miles).
The proposal would serve as the primary connecting route between the Phenix City metropolitan area and the Interstate
highway system. It is anticipated that improvements will generally be made along the existing alignment of U.S. 80.
The improvements to the travel corridor are considered necessary to provide for the existing and projected traffic
demand. Alternatives under consideration include: (1) alternate route locations, (2) improving the existing roadway,
(3) taking no action, and (4) postponing the action.

Notice of Request for Secretarial Directive to the Department of Agriculture Concerning the Ocean Transportation
of Title II Preference Cargoes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated July 1, 1994, and accompanying brief, Waterman Steamship Corporation (Waterman) requests that the
Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) require the Department of Agriculture (Agriculture) to comply with the
Maritime Administration's June 16, 1986, Prioritization letter; require the allocation of preference cargoes
by destination; and require the elimination of bidding procedures which compel U.S.-flag dry cargo liner vessels
to bid against foreign competitors and/or non-liner U.S.-flag vessels for the carriage of preference cargoes generated
by the Pub. L. 480 program, 7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq., Title II of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act
of 1954, (Pub. L. 480). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waterman alleges that Agriculture is improperly administering its cargo preference program in three critically
important respects, thereby impeding Waterman's participation in the cargo preference program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Waterman alleges that Agriculture is violating the Maritime Administration's ``prioritization rule'' issued
June 16, 1986, in that Agriculture is allocating preference cargo to ports where all U.S.-flag service is not available
and is then fixing the cargo on mixed service, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
U.S.-flag vessels with foreign-flag feeder vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Waterman alleges that Agriculture is violating the Cargo Preference Act of 1954, as amended, 46 App. U.S.C. 1241,
(the 1954 Act) by failing to administer its Pub. L. 480 program in such manner as to insure fair and reasonable participation
of U.S.-flag vessels by geographic destination areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Waterman alleges that Agriculture is violating the 1954 Act through bidding procedures which require U.S.-flag
dry cargo liner vessels to bid against foreign-flag and/or non-liner U.S.-flag vessels for preference cargoes which
should be reserved for U.S.-flag liner vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This request may be inspected in the Office of the Secretary, Maritime Administration. Any person, firm, or corporation
having any interest in such request and desiring to submit comments concerning the application must file written
comments in triplicate with the Secretary, Maritime Administration, Room 7300, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street
SW., Washington, DC 20590. Comments must be received no later than 5:00 p.m. on August 17, 1994. This notice is published
as a matter of discretion and publication should in no way be considered a favorable or unfavorable decision on the
request, as filed or as may be amended.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 8, 1993, the President signed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. The Customs
modernization portion of this Act (Title VI of Public Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057, codified at 19 U.S.C. 3301
note), popularly known as the Customs Modernization Act or ``Mod Act,'' became effective when it was signed. In order
to share ``straw man'' implementation proposals specific to carrier manifest requirements and entry and clearance
procedures, remote filing, and general order procedures, and to invite informal dialogue relative to implementation
plans and issues, the Office of Inspection and Control conducted a series of public meetings throughout the country.
These meetings were announced in other

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 15498, dated April 1, 1994, and 59 FR 27306, dated May 26, 1994. Comments and suggestions received on the ``straw
man'' proposals have been reviewed, analyzed, and, in some cases, incorporated into the revised proposals that will
be presented at a final public meeting scheduled to be held on August 26, 1994, in Washington, DC, at the Renaissance
Hotel, located at 999 9th Street, NW., from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meeting will begin with a general briefing covering the Office of Inspection and Control's progress to date, including
a review of the discussions from previous public meetings and future plans to implement ``Mod Act'' provisions. Following
this general briefing, staff members from the Office of Inspection and Control will present revised proposals concerning
vessels, air, truck and rail, general orders, and remote entry filing (for release purposes). Among the topics to
be discussed at this session will be: carrier manifest requirements, electronic transmission of data, carrier entry
and clearance procedures, and carrier liability issues. Presentations on the status of the In-bond Task Force and
the Automated Export System Development Team will be provided by members of those teams. Participants will be given
ample opportunity to ask questions and provide suggestions. In addition, the Director of the ``Mod Act'' Task Force
will report on the present status of implementing provisions of the ``Mod Act.''
