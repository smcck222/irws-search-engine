SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend the regulations: to set forth the acreage reduction percentage for each of the 1995
feed grain crops; to require that producers of malting barley comply with acreage reduction requirements to maintain
eligibility for feed grain loans, purchases, and payments; and to provide that a paid land diversion (PLD) program
will not be in effect. Producers who participate in the Feed Grain Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) would be eligible
for benefits such as price support loans and deficiency payments. This action is required by section 105B of the Agricultural
Act of 1949, as amended (the 1949 Act).

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is issued in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the USDA, this proposed
rule has been determined to be ``economically significant'' because it would have an annual effect on the economy
of more than $100 million and would materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, or loan programs or rights
and obligations of recipients thereof. Budget outlays for deficiency payments are expected to range from $1.5 to
$3.5 billion annually. This proposed rule would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the
economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments
or communities; would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by
another agency; and would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities,
or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is applicable to this proposed rule since the Commodity
Credit Corporation (CCC) is required by section 105B(o) of the 1949 Act to request comments with respect to the subject
matter of this rule. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared, which determined that this regulation
will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because the particular acreage reduction
percentages considered will not affect the paperwork, reporting, or compliance burdens of the small entities in
the program. CCC thus certifies that the rule will have no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

Statutory Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 105B of the 1949 Act, an ARP is required to be implemented for the 1995 crops of corn, grain
sorghum, or barley if it is determined that the total supply of each respective feed grain would otherwise be excessive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Land diversion payments also may be made to producers if needed to adjust the total national acreage of feed grains
to desirable goals. A PLD program is not being considered because, given the allowed ARP percentages, it is not needed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction to the respective
feed grain acreage base for the farm. In making such a determination, the number of acres placed into the agricultural
resources conservation program established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended,
must be taken into consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Producers who knowingly produce feed grains in excess of the respective permitted acreage for the farm plus any respective
feed grain acreage planted in accordance with the flexibility provisions are ineligible for loans and purchases
and all payments with respect to that crop on the farm. If an ARP program for the 1995 crop is in effect, the program must
be announced no later than September 30, 1994. Adjustments in the announced program may be made if it is determined
that there has been a significant change in the total supply of feed grains since the program was first announced. These
adjustments must be made no later than November 15, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 105B of the 1949 Act, not less than 60 days before the program is announced for a crop of feed
grains, proposals for public comment on various program options for the crop of feed grains are required to be set forth.
Each option must be accompanied by an analysis that includes the estimated planted acreage, production, domestic
and export use, ending stocks, season average producer price, program participation rate, and cost to the Federal
Government that would likely result from each option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the 1995 corn ARP, the Secretary will choose a specific ARP reduction percentage from within a range
established by the estimated ending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks-to-use (S/U) ratio for the 1994/95 corn marketing year. If it is estimated that the 1994/95 ending S/U ratio
in percentage terms will be:

(1) More than 25 percent, the ARP shall not be less than 10 percent or more than 20 percent; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Equal to or less than 25 percent, the ARP may not be more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12.5 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The S/U for the 1994/95 marketing year is estimated to be 15.1 percent. Based on this estimate, the 1995 ARP may be not
more than 12.5 percent. In the case of grain sorghum and barley, the Secretary may choose a 1995 ARP percentage in the
range from 0 to 20 percent. For oats, the 1995 ARP is statutorily mandated not to exceed 0 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1104 of the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1990 provides that the acreage reduction factor for the 1995
crops of corn, grain sorghum, and barley may not be less than 7.5 percent unless the estimated corn S/U for the 1994/95
marketing year is less than 20 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently the S/U of corn for the 1993/94 corn marketing year is less than 20 percent. Thus, the minimum 7.5-percent-ARP
provision is not currently applicable. The final ARP decision process could consider higher ARP percentages up to
20 percent if the S/U exceeds 25 percent. The ARP options included in this analysis are the most likely possibilities,
based on May 1994 data. If ending stocks increase, due to weaker demand or higher than expected yields, and raise the
S/U ratio to 25 percent or higher, ARP levels between 12.5 and 20 percent may be considered before a final decision is
made. The 1995 ARP options considered are shown in table 1.

For grain sorghum and barley, ARP percentages higher than 5 percent are not considered because expected sorghum and
barley S/U's are low compared with historical levels. The 1994/95 grain sorghum S/U is forecast at 20.1, which with
the exceptions of 1991/92 and 1993/94, the lowest level since 1976/77 (17.3 percent). The 1994/95 barley S/U is forecast
at 29.1, a level reached only one other time since 1974/75. ARP levels above 5 percent would limit supplies of barley
and grain sorghum to the point of not allowing export and domestic needs to be met. However, ARP levels above 5 percent
will be considered when making the final ARP decision if feed grain supply and demand changes are large enough to warrant
their consideration.

Accordingly, comments are requested as to whether the 1995 acreage reduction percentage for: (1) Corn should be 0,
5, or 12.5 percent or any percentage less than 12.5 percent; (2) Grain sorghum should be 0 or 5 percent or any percentage
in the range of 0 to 20 percent; and (3) Barley should be 0 or 5 percent or any percentage in the range of 0 to 20 percent.
The final determination of these percentages will be set forth at 7 CFR part 1413. In accordance with section 105B(e)(2)(G)
of the 1949 Act, with respect to feed grains, the Secretary may exempt producers of malting barley, as a condition of
eligibility for feed grain loans, purchases, and payments, from complying with the acreage reduction requirements.
It is proposed that malting barley not be exempted from the feed grain acreage reduction requirements for the 1995
crop.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board is seeking public comment on a proposed amendment to the anti-tying provisions of Regulation Y. The proposed
amendment would permit a bank holding company or its nonbank subsidiary to discount any of its products or services
on condition that a customer obtain another product or service from that company or subsidiary or from any of its nonbank
affiliates, provided that all products offered in the package arrangement are separately available for purchase.
This exception would not apply when any product in the arrangement is offered by a bank. The board believes that this
will increase the efficiency with which banking organizations can deliver banking services.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1972) generally prohibits a bank from
tying a product or service to another product or service offered by the bank or by any of its affiliates.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1971, the Board applied these tying restrictions to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries as if
they were banks. 12 CFR 225.4(d)(1); 36 FR 10777, 10778 (1971).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 A prohibited tie-in occurs if a bank: (1) varies the consideration for a product or service (the ``tying product'')
on the condition that the customer obtain some additional product or service (the ``tied product'') from the bank
or from any of its affiliates; or (2) as a condition for providing a customer a product or service, requires the customer
to purchase another product or service from the bank or from any of its affiliates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 11, 1994, the Board requested public comment on proposed amendments to Regulation Y, including an extension
of the so-called traditional bank product exception of section 106 to package arrangements with affiliates. 59 FR
12202 (March 16, 1994). In addition to comments on the proposed rule, which is being made final in a separate document
published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Board received various requests for interpretation or extension of regulatory exceptions to the tying restrictions
imposed by section 106 and Regulation Y. In particular, commenters urged the Board to reconsider its extension of
the tying restrictions of section 106 to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering those requests, the Board has decided to propose an amendment to its anti-tying regulation to conform
it more closely to section 106 and its focus on tying by banks. Under the proposed rule, bank holding companies and their
nonbanking subsidiaries would be permitted to offer discounts on packaged products when: (1) Both the tying and tied
products
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are offered by bank holding companies or their nonbanking subsidiaries_in other words, where no affiliated bank
is involved in the arrangement; and (2) both the tying and tied products are separately available.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In cases that do not qualify for this (or some other) exception, the general restrictions of section 106 and Regulation
Y would continue to apply; for example, if the package arrangement involved a product offered by an affiliated bank,
the exception would not apply and the nonbanking subsidiary could only offer discount package arrangements involving
exclusively traditional bank products or securities brokerage services, under exceptions recently adopted by
the Board and to take effect in thirty days. The antitrust laws also would continue to apply in all cases.

 The ``tying'' product is the product whose consideration is being varied or whose availability is being conditioned.

eligible to purchase the tying product.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board believes that the proposed exception is consistent with the terms and purposes of section 106, is justified
by the competitive environment in which nonbanking subsidiaries generally operate, and is potentially beneficial
both to banking organizations and consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistency With Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By its terms, section 106 applies only when a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bank
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 offers the tying product_that is, when a bank is varying the consideration or conditioning the availability of a product
in order to create an incentive for the customer to purchase another product from the bank or an affiliate. This coverage
was consistent with the stated purpose of section 106: To prevent banks from using their market power over certain
products to gain an unfair competitive advantage in other products. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 1084, 91st Cong., 2d Sess.,
16 (1970) (section 106 was ``intended to provide specific statutory assurance that the use of the economic power of
a bank will not lead to a lessening of competition or unfair competitive practices''). The proposed exception would
apply only when nonbanks are offering the packaged products. Such arrangements are not covered by the terms of section
106; nor do they raise the specific concerns that section 106 was intended to address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistency With Regulation Y 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The tying restrictions of section 106 were imposed by the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 in conjunction
with an extension of new nonbanking powers to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. The potential
for anticompetitive behavior by such subsidiaries_which were then uncommon_was uncertain pending implementation
of the Act, and the Board therefore adopted a prophylactic rule in applying the restrictions of section 106 to bank
holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Much has changed, however, since adoption of that rule. Competition in most financial markets has increased substantially
since 1971, and through its experience in the supervision of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies, the
Board has been able to assess the role of nonbanking subsidiaries in those markets. The Board believes that neither
bank holding companies nor their nonbanking subsidiaries generally appear to possess sufficient market power in
the products that they offer to impair competition. For example, the ``laundry list'' activities in which bank holding
companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries are permitted to engage are generally conducted in competitive national
or regional markets that are characterized by large numbers of actual or potential competitors and low barriers to
entry.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In such markets, the potential for a market participant to gain a competitive advantage through tying is substantially
reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ``laundry list'' activities are specified by regulation. See 12 CFR 225.25. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, if the Board's proposal were adopted, ties involving bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries
would, as noted, continue to be restricted by the federal antitrust laws (primarily the Clayton and Sherman Acts)_the
same restrictions that bind their competitors. In addition, section 106 would continue to restrict tying by banks,
and the Board would continue to apply special restrictions to tying by a nonbank when the tied product is offered by
an affiliated bank. As a final protection, the Board would retain the authority to terminate or modify any exception
that resulted in anticompetitive practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Board is proposing to rescind its special restrictions on tying between nonbanks only where the
products are separately available and a discount is being offered.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These conditions prevent the conditioning of the availability of one product on the purchase of another and allow
consumers to compare prices. The Board recognizes that to the extent that the market for products offered by bank holding
companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries is competitive, these conditions should not be strictly necessary.
The Board seeks comment on whether these conditions should be retained as a precaution against any anti-competitive
practices. The Board also seeks comment on a clarification to the requirement of separate availability, applicable
to all the regulatory exceptions, that would provide that products must be separately available ``at competitive
prices.'' This amendment would clarify that if a product is available outside a package arrangement only at a non-competitive
price, it is not truly separately available.

 Under antitrust law, concerns over tying arrangements are substantially reduced where the buyer is free to take either
product by itself, even though the seller may also offer the two items as a unit at a single price.

Costs of Tying Restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The special tying restrictions imposed on nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies not only appear to be unnecessary
to prevent those companies from gaining an unfair competitive advantage, but also place those companies at a competitive
disadvantage with other providers of the same products and services. As a result of Regulation Y's current prohibition,
a nonbanking company is generally prohibited from offering discounted packages of its own products or discounted
packages that include its own products and those of other affiliated nonbanking companies. Their competitors who
are not affiliated with banks are not similarly constrained. Several commenters in the Board's recent rulemaking
noted that brokerage firms and other nonbank competitors are offering the types of discounts currently prohibited
by Regulation Y, which are not generally illegal for purposes of the federal antitrust laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inability of nonbanks in a holding company structure to offer discounts not only diminishes their competitiveness
but also deprives their customers of an opportunity to receive discounts. The Board believes that under the proposed
rule, customers would be presented with more choices and potentially lower costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Congressional Intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board notes that this proposed treatment of tying by nonbanking subsidiaries is consistent with recent Congressional
action in the tying area. In applying anti-tying restrictions to savings associations in the Garn-St. Germain Depository
Institutions Act, Public Law No. 97&hyph;320, section 331, 96 Stat. 1496, Congress closely paralleled section 106
in applying the restriction only when the tying product was offered by the savings association. An extension of the
restrictions to non-savings association affiliates of the type adopted by the Board was neither included by Congress
nor subsequently adopted by the Office of Thrift Supervision.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is withdrawing a previously published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(NPRM) that proposed to amend the Federal Aviation Regulations to revise the airplane type certification standards
and operating rules. The proposed amendments would have required that future civil supersonic airplanes meet noise
limits consistent with those required for future civil subsonic airplanes. The FAA is postponing development of
a final rule because it cannot ensure that the final rule would be economically reasonable and technologically practical
at this time. The FAA will continue to gather technical information and analyze suggested recommendations for test
and measurement conditions.

 On October 30, 1986, the FAA published Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking No. 86&hyph;16 (51 FR 39663), announcing
its tentative intention to amend 14 CFR parts 36 and 91. The comment period for Notice No. 86&hyph;16 was reopened on
March 12, 1987 (52 FR 7618) to allow interested parties additional time to comment.

On May 30, 1990, the FAA published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) No. 86&hyph;16 (55 FR 22020), proposing to
amend 14 CFR parts 36 and 91. These revisions were intended to aid the development of next-generation supersonic airplanes
by establishing a notice standard for supersonic airplanes that is consistent with noise limits for conventional
(subsonic) airplanes. In the NPRM, the FAA requested that the public comment on the following issues: (1) Requirement
that future supersonic airplanes (SST) meet noise limits consistent with those required for future subsonic airplanes,
(2) recommendations on test and measurement conditions and operational characteristics appropriate for future
SST's, and (3) cost of the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After analyzing the comments received on the NPRM, the FAA has determined that further investigation and research
is necessary before developing the final rule. The FAA will continue to gather technical information and analyze
suggested recommendations for test and measurement conditions. A statement concerning FAA policy on this matter
is published elsewhere in this issue of the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is considering amending its regulations regarding the valuation of gas produced
from Indian leases to ensure that Indian mineral lessors receive the maximum revenues from mineral resources on their
land consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's (Secretary) trust responsibility and lease terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most Indian leases provide that the value of production for royalty purposes be determined by the Secretary. In making
this determination, the Secretary must consider his trust responsibility. In the exercise of this responsibility,
value in the discretion of the Secretary may be determined by taking the highest of several values. This notice describes
several alternatives to establish these values and solicits comments before publishing proposed new regulations
governing the value of gas production from Indian lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MMS is not currently proposing changes to the oil valuation regulations for Indian leases. The MMS may consider
changes following study of oil valuation for Indian leases.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
All Indian leases contain provisions for the determination of royalty obligations. Some Indian leases or agreements
negotiated under the 1982 Indian Mineral Development Act contain explicit methodologies for determining royalty
obligations. The MMS does not intend to alter these express valuation methodologies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Most Indian leases were entered into under the authority of earlier statutes, and these leases reserve to the Secretary
considerable discretion in determining value for royalty purposes. This Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
is intended to solicit comments on new methodologies being considered to establish value for these leases. Comments
that are received in response to this Advance Notice will be considered in the development of a proposed rulemaking
that will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at a future date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most Indian leases also provide that royalty obligations be based on the value of hydrocarbon substances produced
and saved. A royalty obligation is incurred when hydrocarbon substances are produced and saved and not solely as the
result of a sale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3(c) of a standard Indian lease covers leasee rental and royalty payment requirements and states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Rental and royalty. To pay, beginning with the date of approval of the lease by the Secretary of the Interior or his
duly authorized representative, a rental of $1.25 per acre per annum in advance during the continuance hereof, the
rental so paid for any one year to be credited on the royalty for that year, together with a royalty of 162/3 percent of
the value or amount of all oil, gas, and/or natural gasoline, and/or all other hydrocarbon substances produced and
saved from the land leased herein, save and except oil, and/or gas used by the lessee for development and operation
purposes on said lease, which oil or gas shall be royalty free. During the period of supervision, ``value'' for the
purposes hereof may, in the discretion of the Secretary, be calculated on the basis of the highest price paid or offered
(whether calculated on the basis of short or actual volume) at the time of production for the major portion of the oil
of the same gravity, and gas, and/or natural gasoline, and/or all other hydrocarbon substances produced and sold
from the field where the leased lands are situated, and the actual volume of the marketable product less the content
of foreign substances as determined by the oil and gas supervisor. The actual amount realized by the lessee from the
sale of said products may, in the discretion of the Secretary, be deemed mere evidence of or conclusive evidence of
such value. When paid in value, such royalties shall be due and payable monthly on the last day of the calendar month
following the calendar month in which produced; when royalty on oil produced is paid in kind, such royalty oil shall
be delivered in tanks provided by the lessee on the premises where produced without cost to the lessor unless otherwise
agreed to by the parties thereto, at such time as may be required by the lessor: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, that the lessee shall not be required to hold such royalty oil in storage longer than 30 days after the end of the calendar
month in which said oil is produced: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
And provided further
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, that the lessee shall be in no manner responsible or held liable for loss or destruction of such oil in storage caused
by acts of God. All rental and royalty payments, except as provided in section 4(c) shall be made by check or draft drawn
on a solvent bank, open for the transaction of business on the day the check or draft is issued, to the payee designated
by the Area Director. All such rental and royalty payments shall be mailed to the oil and gas supervisor for transmittal
to the payee designated by the Area Director. It is understood that in determining the value for royalty purposes of
products, such as natural gasoline, that are derived from treatment of gas, a reasonable allowance for the cost of
manufacture shall be made, such allowance to be two-thirds of the value of the marketable product unless otherwise
determined by the Secretary of the Interior on application of the lessee or on his own initiative, and that royalty
will be computed on the value of gas or casinghead gas, or on the products thereof (such as residue gas, natural gasoline,
propane, butane, etc.), whichever is the greater.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conjunction with the lease terms, the valuation of gas production from Indian leases is subject to the regulations
at 30 CFR Part 206. The present regulations govern the valuation of production from both Federal and Indian (Tribal
and allotted) leases (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, Oklahoma) (Revision of Gas Royalty Valuation
Regulations and Related Topics; Final Rule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 15, 1988 (53 FR 1230).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS now believes that it may be able to better perform the trust responsibilities of the United States with respect
to the administration of Indian oil and gas leases by issuing separate regulations for the valuation of gas from these
leases. Also, MMS believes that it could provide an improved regulatory framework in which these lease terms can be
strictly enforced while economizing on the information needed by a lessee. MMS is seeking to adopt valuation procedures
that could be compiled with by the lessee in a timely manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is obligated to act as a fiduciary in the administration of Indian oil and gas leases. As a fiduciary,
charged with supervising the disposition of nonrenewable resources from Indian lands, the Secretary must ensure
that Indians receive the maximum revenues from mineral resources on their lands. To ensure maximum revenues, the
value of production for royalty purposes from an Indian lease should be determined considering the highest values
provided by the terms of the standard lease, quoted above. MMS believes this is consistent with the terms of these Indian
oil and gas leases, with statutes delegating to the Secretary the administration of Indian affairs, with the statutes
governing Indian oil and gas leases, with the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 (FOGRMA), with court
decisions providing judicial guidance in the interpretation and administration of Indian oil and gas leases, and
with the law of trusts and fiduciary operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS has considered that maximizing royalty revenues from Indian leases might affect the economics of mineral resource
development and believes that this should not result in the reduction of the value of production for royalty purposes.
This issue should be examined in the context of an adjustment of lease terms by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian
lessor.

II. Current Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current valuation regulations incorporate the terms of the standard Indian leases in the ways listed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The value of production is never less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee. This provision is contained
in valuation regulations at 30 CFR 206.102(h), 206.152(h), and 206.153(h), which state:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no circumstances shall the value of production, for royalty
purposes, be less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for lease production, less applicable allowances
determined pursuant to this subpart.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) The value of production will be the higher of the major portion value and the otherwise applicable value. This provision
is contained in valuation regulations at 30 CFR 206.102(a)(2)(i), 206.152(a)(3)(i), and 206.153(a)(3)(i), which
state:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For any Indian leases which provide that the Secretary may consider the highest price paid or offered for a major portion
of production (major portion) in determining value for royalty purposes, if data are available to compute a major
portion, MMS will, where practicable, compare the value determined in accordance with this section with the major
portion. The value to be used in determining the value of production, for royalty purposes, shall be the higher of those
two values.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) The value of production will be the greater of (1) the combined value, for royalty purposes, of the residue gas and
gas plant products resulting from processing the gas, or (2) the value, for royalty purposes, of the gas prior to processing
determined in accordance with 30 CFR &sect;&sect;206.152 and 206.155.

III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary's responsibility to determine value for royalty purposes of production from Indian lands has not changed,
although the industry and marketplace have changed dramatically over the years. One of the objectives MMS hopes to
achieve is to develop a set of regulations to permit the Secretary to discharge this responsibility in an environment
of continuing and accelerating change in the industry and the marketplace. The trust responsibility of the Secretary
and the changing marketplace require that the Secretary develop flexible valuation methodologies for Indian production
that can be complied with accuracy and on time. MMS seeks to improve several areas of Indian gas valuation including:
major portion analysis, accounting for comparison (dual accounting), and Percentage-of-Proceeds (POP) contracts.
Following is a discussion of each of these areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Major Portion Value
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3(c) of most Indian leases provides that value may be based on the highest price paid or offered for a major portion
of oil or gas or similar substances. Many lessees have stated that there are difficulties encountered in complying
with major portion valuation requirements and the timeliness of major portion analyses performed by MMS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indian mineral owners assert the median pricing methodology in the present regulations does not always achieve the
highest price paid for a major portion of production provided by the lease terms. Since the Secretary has considerable
discretion in establishing value for royalty purposes, the Secretary has been urged to be more flexible in establishing
major portion methodologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Dual Accounting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3(c) of most Indian leases provides for ``dual accounting''_the requirement to pay royalties on the greater
of the combined value of the residue gas and plant products resulting from processing the gas or the value of the gas
prior to processing. Dual accounting is required whether gas is sold prior to processing or after processing. In either
case, the lessees may have difficulty in gathering the data necessary to comply, which delays the proper payment of
royalties to the Indian lessors. Improvement in the regulations that will permit lessees to timely and completely
comply with the lease's dual accounting requirement is desirable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Percentage-of-Proceeds (POP) Contracts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This class of contracts for the sale of gas from Indian leases presents a different problem in determining value for
royalty purposes. Under a POP contract, the seller is paid based upon a value determined after processing. As the name
given to this class of contract suggests, the seller is paid an agreed-upon percentage of the purchaser's proceeds
from the sale of residue gas and usually a different and much smaller percentage of the proceeds from the sale of gas
plant products. Lessees have objected to the dual accounting requirement for gas sold pursuant to a POP contract because
of a lack of wellhead sales. Regulations that permit lessees to timely and accurately comply with POP contract valuation
requirements are desirable.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In summary MMS's goal is to develop simplified methods for determining the highest price paid or offered for a major
portion of like-quality production from the field or area, for determining the greater of the processed value or the
unprocessed value, and for properly valuing POP contract production, on a more contemporaneous basis. This would
simplify the accounting and enhance the administrative workability for both Tribal and MMS royalty personnel as
well as the oil and gas industry. It would allow more contemporaneous automated accounting comparisons and reduce
the reliance on audits conducted years after production occurs to verify royalty compliance.

(1) Use of Gas Price Indices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MMS is considering using published indices of natural gas prices as a means to determine the price at which a major portion
of gas is sold from a given field or area. It is contemplated that any index or indices used would be widely used by industry,
have a history of publication, and generally be expected to continue to be published. It is likewise contemplated
that any regulation that uses published indices would provide for the use of substitute indices if necessary. MMS
is aware that gas-index-price-based major portion systems are currently being successfully utilized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS is soliciting comments on what publications are most widely used by industry for gas price indices. MMS also seeks
input from companies that are successfully using gas price index-based formulas to determine the major portion value,
and the ways the gas price indices are used to arrive at a value. MMS is also particularly interested in perspectives
regarding the extent to which published prices reflect actual values of production, and perspectives regarding
the accuracy of published prices and indices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS would also appreciate comments on the extent to which the use of published prices would promote: The certainty
and reliability of payments, the timeliness of royalty reporting, ease of compliance, enforceability, and the reduction
of costs to both industry and government.

to MMS. MMS would then calculate major portion prices and provide these to the lessees. MMS seeks comments on the feasibility
of such an approach.

(5) Flexibility To Negotiate a Method to do a Major Portion Analysis on a Case-By-Case Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MMS is considering adding new regulatory language that would allow lessees the flexibility to negotiate with Indian
Tribes and allottees a method of fulfilling the value of a major portion of production from a field or area. MMS seeks
comments on the feasibility of such an approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Dual Accounting Scenarios
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Wellhead Sale of Gas and the Gas Is Processed (Seller Not Owner in Gas Plant)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this scenario, the lessee typically sells gas prior to processing in a gas plant. The lessee should know the gross
proceeds accruing under the sale of gas at the wellhead. To fulfill the dual accounting requirement, the lessee is
also required to obtain the actual sales values of the residue gas and gas plant products after processing. Lessees
have made MMS aware of the difficulty, in some instances, in obtaining all of the information necessary to determine
accurately the value of production. On July 27, 1992, MMS issued a letter to payors describing a theoretical dual accounting
method that can be used to approximate the value of gas after processing. Although this method has helped, MMS has been
made aware that there are still problems in obtaining information that is both timely and accurate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the process of obtaining all of the information (such as gas plant efficiencies, processing charges,
plant fuel and flare volumes, and fractionation costs) necessary to accurately do dual accounting, MMS is considering
the following alternatives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;MMS could draft regulations requiring owners of plants that process Federal and/or Indian gas to report the
processing information directly either to MMS, the lessee, or both.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;MMS could attempt to obtain information on plants that process Indian gas from State agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS requests comments on the feasibility of requiring plant owners to make processing information available to lessees
or MMS. MMS also welcomes suggestions for any other possible alternatives for obtaining this information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS is also considering establishing a single basin-wide processing allowance that would be used by all lessees or
could be used when the lessee does not have actual processing plant information. MMS requests comments on using basin-wide
allowances that the MMS would periodically calculate and publish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Gas Is Sold at the Tailgate of a Gas Plant
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this situation, the lessee should have all of the data pertaining to the sale of the processed gas. To fulfill the
dual accounting requirement, the lessee must determine the value of the unprocessed gas at the wellhead. When there
is no sale of gas at the wellhead, the wellhead unit value ($/MMBtu) of the gas for royalty purposes could be determined
by using: (1) Gross proceeds under arm's-length contracts for like-quality gas in the same field or nearby fields
or areas; (2) the unit value of the residue gas; (3) gas price indices posted in publicly available national publications;
or (4) the price arrived at by performing a major portion analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS seeks comments on the availability of information and the accuracy of the above methods in determining the value
for royalty purposes of unprocessed gas at the wellhead. MMS further seeks comments on what specific publications
are used by industry for index prices. MMS also seeks comments on using the highest price in the range, the index price,
the average price, or some combination of prices if index pricing were used in dual accounting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Gas Is Sold Under a POP Contract
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MMS requests comments on the following methods of determining value of gas at the wellhead under a POP contract when
doing dual accounting:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Gross proceeds under the POP contract,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The unit value of the residue gas,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Gas price indices posted in publicly available national publications,

(iv) The price arrived at by performing a major portion analysis; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Prices received under arm's-length wellhead sales in the field or area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS also seeks suggestions on other possible methods to arrive at a value of unprocessed gas at the wellhead for comparison
purposes under dual accounting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Percentage Increase to Value in Lieu of Dual Accounting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In situations where lessees have made a reasonable effort to do dual accounting but nonetheless cannot establish
an accurate comparison of values, MMS is considering allowing a percentage increase to the otherwise determined
value of production in lieu of dual accounting. Analysis has shown that the difference between the greater of the combined
value of the residue gas and plant products resulting from processing the gas or the value of the gas prior to processing
has exceeded 40 percent of the lower value in some cases. MMS seeks comments on the feasibility of applying a percentage
increase and the amount of such an increase to comply with dual accounting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Integration of Major Portion Scenarios and Dual Accounting Scenarios
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MMS seeks comments on how to integrate any selected scenarios on major portion with the scenarios on dual accounting.
For example, one way to integrate these is the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the index scenario is selected for major portion analysis and the percentage increase is selected for dual accounting,
then a way to integrate these concepts is to apply the percentage increase to the higher of index or gross proceeds.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve a February 11, 1993, State submittal
requesting a revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP) for carbon monoxide (CO). The revision pertains
to a site-specific emission limit for a iron foundry operated by General Motors Corporation (GMC) and located adjacent
to Interstate 74 at G Street in Vermilion County, Illinois. Vermilion County has been designated by USEPA as ``unclassifiable/attainment''
for carbon monoxide. In the final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the USEPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final
rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments,
the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule
based on this proposed rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested
in commenting on this notice should do so at this time.

SUMMARY:

The EPA proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Alabama for the
purpose of establishing an emission statement program. In the final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rational for the approval
is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule
will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on
this document should do so at this time.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Halophila johnsonii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Because the subject matter of this proposed rule is closely
related to a proposal published on September 15, 1993 (58 FR 48326), to list Johnson's seagrass as a threatened species,
NMFS is announcing a public hearing to consider both proposed rules. NMFS is also reopening the comment period for
the proposed rule to list Johnson's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seagrass. The hearing will be held September 20, 1994, in Vero Beach, FL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Johnson's seagrass is found on the east coast of Florida from Sebastian Inlet to central Biscayne Bay. Within this
range, five areas in proximity to Sebastian Inlet, Ft. Pierce Inlet, St. Lucie Inlet, Jupiter Inlet and Lake Worth
Inlet are proposed for critical habitat. In addition, the proposed critical habitat designation identifies those
physical and biological features of the habitat that are essential to the conservation of the species and that may
require special management consideration or protection. The economic and other impacts resulting from this critical
habitat designation, over and above those arising from the listing of the species under the ESA, are expected to be
minimal. The designation of proposed critical habitat provides explicit notice to Federal agencies and the public
that these areas and features are vital to the conservation of the species.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
NMFS published a proposed rule to list Johnson's seagrass as a threatened species on September 15, 1993 (58 FR 48326).
Critical habitat was not proposed for designation at that time because the analysis of impacts of the proposed designation,
as required by section 4(b)(2) of the ESA, had not been completed.

NMFS has now completed an environmental assessment (EA), pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),
to evaluate both the environmental and economic impacts of the proposed critical habitat designation (See ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed designation identifies those physical and biological features of the habitat that are essential to
the conservation of the species and that may require special management consideration or protection. The direct
economic and other impacts resulting from designating critical habitat, over and above those that result from listing
the species, are expected to be minimal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Definition of Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the ESA as ``(i) the specific areas within the geographical area
occupied by the species *&blank;*&blank;* on which are found those physical or biological features (I) Essential
to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations or protection; and
(ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species *&blank;*&blank;* upon a determination
by the Secretary that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.'' Areas outside the current range
of a species can only be designated if a designation limited to the species' present distribution would be inadequate
to ensure the conservation of the species. The term conservation, as defined in section 3(3) of the ESA, means ``*&blank;*&blank;*
to use and the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring any endangered species or threatened species
to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria to be considered in designating critical habitat are specified under 50 CFR 424.12. When designating
critical habitat, NMFS considers physical and biological features that are essential to the conservation of the
species and that may require special management consideration or protection, including but not limited to the following:
(1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior; (2) food, water, air, light, minerals or
other nutritional or physiological requirements; (3) cover or shelter; (4) sites for breeding, reproduction or
rearing of offspring; and, generally, (5) habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of
the historic geographical and ecological distributions of the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, NMFS must list the known physical and biological features (primary constituent elements) within the
designated area(s) that are essential to the conservation of the species and that may require special management
considerations or protection. These essential features may include, but are not limited to, food resources, water
quality or quantity and vegetation and sediment types and stability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Consideration of Economic and Other Factors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The economic, environmental and other impacts of a designation must also be evaluated and considered. NMFS must identify
present and future activities that may adversely modify the proposed critical habitat or be affected by a designation.
An area may be excluded from a critical habitat designation if NMFS determines that the overall benefits of exclusion
outweigh the benefits of designation, unless the exclusion will result in the extinction of the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impacts considered in this analysis are only those incremental impacts that specifically result from designating
critical habitat, above the economic and other impacts attributable to listing the species. These incremental impacts
are expected to be minimal (See Significance of Designating Critical Habitat section). In general, the designation
of critical habitat duplicates and reinforces the substantive protection resulting from the listing itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Impacts attributable to listing include those resulting from the taking prohibitions under section 9 and associated
regulations. With respect to fish and wildlife, ``taking'' as defined in the ESA includes harm to a listed species.
Harm can occur through destruction or modification of habitat (whether or not designated as critical) that significantly
impairs essential behaviors, including breeding, feeding or sheltering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to plants, section 9 of the ESA makes it unlawful for any person subject to U.S. jurisdiction to ``remove
and reduce to possession any such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any
such species on any such area; or remove, cut, dig up, or damage or destroy any such species on any other area in knowing
violation of any law or regulation of any state or in the course of any violation of a state criminal trespass law.''
Although this provision does not prohibit takings, such as harm or harassment of a species of fish or wildlife, it does
provide protection for plants in areas under Federal jurisdiction and under state laws. As with the takings prohibition
for fish and wildlife, these protections are triggered when a species is listed. Therefore, generally, the critical
habitat designation will duplicate these protections. This is particularly true with respect to acts that ``remove,
cut, dig up or damage or destroy listed plants in knowing violation of any law or regulation of any state.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Impacts attributable to listing also include those resulting from the responsibility of all Federal agencies under
section 7 to ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize endangered or threatened species. An action could
be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species through the destruction or adverse modification
of its habitat, whether or not that habitat has been designated as critical.

Significance of Designating Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The designation of critical habitat does not, in itself, restrict state or private activities within the area. A critical
habitat designation contributes to conservation of the species primarily by identifying critically important
areas and describing the features within the areas that are essential to the species, thus alerting public and private
entities to the importance of the area. Under the ESA, the only direct impact of a critical habitat designation is through
the provisions of section 7. Section 7 applies only to actions with Federal involvement and does not affect state or
private activities unless there is Federal involvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the section 7 provisions, a designation of critical habitat would require Federal agencies to ensure that any
action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to destroy or adversely modify the designated critical habitat.
Activities that adversely modify critical habitat are defined as those actions that ``appreciably diminish the
value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery'' of the species (50 CFR 402.02). However, if no critical
habitat has been designated, Federal agencies still must ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the
continued existence of the listed species. Activities that jeopardize a species are defined as those actions that
``reasonably would be expected, directly or indirectly, to reduce appreciably the likelihood of both the survival
and recovery'' of the species (50 CFR 402.02). Using these definitions, activities that destroy or adversely modify
critical habitat also are likely to jeopardize the species. Therefore, the protection provided by a critical habitat
designation usually only duplicates the protection provided under the section 7 jeopardy provision. Critical habitat
may provide additional benefits to a species where areas outside of the species' current range have been designated.
In these cases, it is expected that Federal agencies would consult on actions occurring in these areas for which they
would otherwise not need to consult.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A designation of critical habitat provides a clearer indication to the Federal agencies as to when consultation under
section 7 is required, particularly in cases where the action would not result in direct mortality or injury to individuals
of a listed species (e.g., an action occurring within the critical area when a migratory species is not present). The
critical habitat designation, describing the essential features of the habitat, also assists in determining which
activities conducted outside the designated area are subject to section 7 (i.e., activities that may affect essential
features of the designated area). For example, disposal of waste material in water adjacent to a critical habitat
area may affect an essential feature of the designated habitat (water quality) and would be subject to the provisions
of section 7 of the ESA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A critical habitat designation also assists Federal agencies in planning future actions, since the designation
establishes, in advance, those habitats that will be given special consideration in section 7 consultations. This
is particularly true in cases where there are alternative areas that would provide for the conservation of the species.
With a designation of critical habitat, potential conflicts between projects and endangered or threatened species
can be identified and possibly avoided early in the agency's planning process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another indirect benefit of designating critical habitat is that it helps focus Federal, state and private conservation
and management efforts in those areas. Recovery efforts may address special considerations needed in critical habitat
areas, including conservation regulations to restrict private as well as Federal activities. The economic and other
impacts of these actions would be considered at the time of proposal, and, therefore, are not considered in the critical
habitat designation process. Other Federal, state and local laws or regulations, such as zoning or wetlands protection,
may also provide special protection for critical habitat areas.

Process for Designating Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Developing a proposal for critical habitat designation involves three main considerations. First, the biological
needs of the species are evaluated and essential habitat areas and features are identified. If there are alternative
areas that would provide for the conservation of the species, these alternatives are also identified. Second, the
need for special management considerations or protection of the area(s) or features is evaluated. Finally, the probable
economic and other impacts of designating these essential areas as ``critical habitat'' are evaluated. After considering
the requirements of the species, the need for special management, and the impacts of the designation, the proposed
critical habitat is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for comment. The final critical habitat designation, considering comments on the proposal and impacts assessment,
should be published within 1 year of the proposal. Section 4 (a)(3)(A) of the ESA requires that, to the maximum extent
prudent and determinable, NMFS designate critical habitat concurrently with a determination that a species is endangered
or threatened. Final critical habitat designations may be revised, using the same process, as new data become available.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A description of the essential habitat, need for special management considerations, and impacts of designating
critical habitat for Johnson's seagrass, as well as the proposed action, are described in the following sections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Essential Habitat of Johnson's Seagrass
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The biology of Johnson's seagrass is discussed in the proposed rule to list the species as threatened (58 FR 48326,
September 15, 1993) and includes information on the status of the species, its life history characteristics and habitat
requirements, as well as projects, activities and other factors affecting the species. The current status of Johnson's
seagrass is presented in the EA prepared for this critical habitat designation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The physical habitat that supports Johnson's seagrass includes both shallow intertidal as well as deeper subtidal
zones. The species prospers and is able to colonize and maintain stable populations either in water that is clear and
deep (2&hyph;5 m) or in water that is shallow and turbid. In tidal channels, it inhabits coarse sand substrates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on published reports and discussions with seagrass experts, the distributional range of Johnson's seagrass
is limited to the east coast of Florida from central Biscayne Bay (25
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;45
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat.) to Sebastian Inlet (27
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;50
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat.). There have been no reports of healthy populations of this species outside the presently known range.
Although the species occurs throughout the Indian River Lagoon and Lake Worth, the five specific areas proposed for
critical habitat encompass the largest known contiguous populations of Johnson's seagrass. While a population
within Biscayne Bay has been confirmed by literature and observation, it is discontinuous from the other areas where
the species is found, and the area has not been studied or delineated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The species is patchily distributed within its range. The dimensions of patches range from a few square centimeters
to approximately 327 square meters. The survival of the species likely depends on maintaining its existing viable
populations, especially the areas where the larger patches are found. The Sebastian Inlet population is believed
to be the northern limit of its distribution and includes the largest known patch of Johnson's seagrass. The other
areas proposed for critical habitat designation represent the core range of the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spread of the species into new areas is limited by its reproductive potential. Johnson's seagrass possesses only
female flowers; thus vegetative propagation, most likely through asexual branching, appears to be its only means
of reproduction and dispersal. If an established community is disturbed, regrowth and reestablishment is extremely
unlikely. If extirpated from an area, it is doubtful that the species would be capable of repopulation. This species'
method of reproduction impedes its ability to increase distribution as establishment of new vegetation requires
considerable stability in environmental conditions and protection from human-induced disturbances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the best available information, the essential features of the areas proposed for critical habitat designation
include adequate (1) water quality; (2) salinity levels; (3) water transparency; (4) and stable, unconsolidated
sediments that are free from physical disturbance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Need for Special Management Consideration or Protection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS has determined that the essential areas and features described in the previous section are at risk and may require
special management consideration or protection. Special management may be required because of the following activities:
(1) Vessel traffic and the resulting propeller dredging and anchor mooring; (2) maintenance dredging; (3) dock and
marina construction; (4) water pollution; and (5) land use practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Activities associated with recreational boat traffic account for the majority of human use associated with the proposed
critical habitat areas. The destruction of the benthic community due to boating activities, propeller dredging,
anchor mooring and dock and marina construction was observed at all sites during a study by NMFS from 1990&hyph;1992.
These activities severely disrupt the benthic habitat, breaching root systems and severing rhizomes and significantly
reducing the viability of the benthic community. Propeller dredging and anchor mooring in shallow areas is a major
disturbance to even the most robust seagrasses. This destruction is expected to worsen with the predicted increase
in boating activity (Pat Rose, Florida Department of Natural Resources, personal communication). Trampling of
seagrass beds, a secondary effect of recreational boating, also contributes to disturbing seagrass habitat. Populations
of Johnson's seagrass inhabiting shallow water close to inlets where vessel traffic is concentrated will be most
affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The constant sedimentation patterns in and around inlets require frequent maintenance dredging, which could either
directly remove essential seagrass habitat or indirectly affect it by redistributing sediments, burying plants
and destabilizing the bottom structure. Altering benthic topography or burying the plants may remove them from the
photic zone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decreased water transparency caused by suspended sediments, water color and chlorophylls could have significant
detrimental effects on the distribution and abundance of the deeper water populations of Johnson's seagrass. Evidence
from a distribution survey in Hobe and Jupiter Sounds indicates that the abundance of this seagrass diminishes in
the more turbid interior portion of the lagoon where reduced photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) limits photosynthesis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other areas of concern include seagrass beds located in proximity to rivers and canal mouths where low salinity, highly
colored water is discharged. Freshwater discharge into areas adjacent to seagrass beds may provoke physiological
stress upon the plants by reducing the salinity levels. Additionally, colored waters released into these areas reduce
the amount of sunlight necessary for photosynthesis by rapidly attenuating shorter wavelengths of PAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, continuing and increasing degradation of water quality due to increased land use and water management threatens
the welfare of seagrass communities. Nutrient overenrichment caused by inorganic and organic nitrogen and phosphorous
loading via urban and agricultural land run-off stimulates increased algal growth that may smother Johnson's seagrass,
shade rooted vegetation and diminish the oxygen content of the water. Low oxygen conditions have a demonstrated negative
impact on seagrasses and associated communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special consideration and protection for these and other habitat features will be evaluated during the section 7
process and in development and implementation of a recovery plan. If adequate protection cannot be provided through
consultation or through the recovery planning process, separate management actions with binding requirements
may be considered.

Federal Activities that May Impact Essential Habitat and Features
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A wide range of activities funded, authorized or carried out by Federal agencies may affect the essential habitat
requirements of Johnson's seagrass. These include authorization by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for beach nourishment,
dredging and related activities including construction of docks and marinas; actions by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency to manage freshwater discharges into waterways; regulation of vessel traffic by the U.S. Coast
Guard; authorization of oil and gas exploration by the Minerals Management Service; management of national refuges
and protected species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; management of vessel traffic and other activities by
the U.S. Navy; authorization of state coastal zone management plans by NOAA's National Ocean Service, and management
of commercial fishing and protected species by NMFS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Expected Impacts of Designating Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 7 of the ESA, Federal agencies are required to ensure that actions that they authorize, fund or carry
out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or to result in the destruction or adverse
modification of listed species' critical habitat. Also, takings of Johnson's seagrass will be prohibited under
the proposed regulations issued to list the species as threatened.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This designation will identify specific habitat areas that have been determined to be essential for the conservation
of Johnson's seagrass and that may be in need of special management considerations or protection. It will require
Federal agencies to evaluate their activities with respect to the critical habitat of this species and to consult
with NMFS pursuant to section 7 of the ESA before engaging in any action that may affect the critical habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if Johnson's seagrass is listed as proposed, Federal agencies active within the range of the species will
be required to consult with NMFS if projects and activities they authorize, fund or otherwise carry out may affect
the species, regardless of whether critical habitat is designated. Therefore, it is unlikely that additional consultations
will result from designating critical habitat for Johnson's seagrass.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, it is not likely that designation of critical habitat for Johnson's seagrass will have any additional
adverse economic impacts on Federal, state or private activities beyond those that would occur as a result of listing
the species. As discussed in the section on activities that may impact essential habitat and features, the Federal
activities that may affect critical habitat are the same activities that may affect the species itself. For plants,
this is particularly true when analyzing the impacts of designating critical habitat. For example, the activities
that affect water quality, an essential feature of critical habitat, also will be considered in terms of how they affect
the species itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should this proposed designation of critical habitat be adopted, Federal agencies will continue to engage in section
7 consultations to determine if the actions they authorize, fund or carry out are likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of Johnson's seagrass; however, with designation, they would also need to address explicitly impacts
to the species' critical habitat. This is not expected to affect materially the scope of future consultations or result
in greater economic impacts, since the impacts to Johnson's seagrass habitat will already be considered in section
7 consultations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic costs to be considered in a critical habitat designation are the incremental costs of designation above
the economic impacts attributable to listing or attributable to authorities other that the ESA. NMFS has determined
that there are no incremental net costs for areas within the species' current distribution, and no areas outside the
current range are proposed for critical habitat designation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Proposed Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on available information, NMFS proposes to designate critical habitat that is considered essential for the
survival and recovery of Johnson's seagrass and that may require special management consideration or protection.
The critical habitat designation proposed by this rule includes the largest contiguous areas that are currently
utilized by Johnson's seagrass.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Johnson's seagrass is found throughout the Indian River Lagoon, Lake Worth and in some areas of Biscayne
Bay, NMFS is not proposing to include these areas in the proposed designation until more information is available
and the areas are delineated, and it can be determined that these areas meet the requirements for designation as critical
habitat. For the same reason, NMFS is not including in the proposed designation any areas outside the species' currently
known geographical area. NMFS has concluded that, at this time, proper management of the essential features of the
areas in proximity to the five inlets will be sufficient to provide for the survival and recovery of this species. If
the species is listed as proposed, Federal activities in any area occupied by Johnson's seagrass would be subject
to the section 7 consultation process whether or not the area has been designated as critical habitat. In addition,
NMFS may reconsider this evaluation and propose additional areas for critical habitat at any time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The five areas proposed for critical habitat designation include the intertidal and subtidal areas in proximity
to five inlets on the east coast of Florida. These areas are within 3 to 5 kilometers of the inlet and experience regular
tidal flushing with salinity greater than 15 ppt. Maps are provided for reference purposes to guide Federal agencies
and other interested parties in locating the general boundaries of the proposed critical habitat. They do not constitute
the definition of the boundaries of critical habitat. Persons must refer to the regulations at 50 CFR 226.91 for the
actual boundaries of the designated critical habitat.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the
Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that the proposed rule, if adopted, would not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities since it is primarily Federal agencies that
will be affected. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries (NOAA) has determined that the proposed designation is consistent to
the maximum extent practicable with the approved Coastal Zone Management Program of the State of Florida. This determination
has been submitted for review by the responsible state agency under section 3.7 of the Coastal Zone Management Act.

 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that a fishery management plan or amendment
prepared by a fishery management council be submitted to the Secretary for review and approval, disapproval, or partial
disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving the document, immediately publish
a notice that the amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider public comment
in determining approvability of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 7 proposes to: (1) Increase the domestic quota for royal red shrimp harvested from the exclusive economic
zone of the Gulf of Mexico and eliminate the total allowable level of foreign fishing for royal red shrimp from that
area; (2) revise the definition of overfishing for royal red shrimp and provide a procedure for updating maximum sustainable
yield of royal red shrimp; (3) define overfishing for white shrimp; (4) establish procedures for revising the overfishing
indices for brown, white, and pink shrimp when new data become available; and (5) specify actions to be taken if overfishing
for brown, white, pink, or royal red shrimp occurs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed regulations to implement Amendment 7 are scheduled for publication within 15 days.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the U.S. BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according
to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared
by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management
Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the initial TACs specified for sablefish in the Bering Sea
subarea (BS), for sablefish and the sharpchin/northern rockfish species category in the Aleutian Islands subarea
(AI), and for Atka mackerel in the Central and Western Aleutian Districts, need to be supplemented from the non-specific
reserve to continue operations and account for prior harvest. Therefore, in accordance with &sect;675.20(b), NMFS
proposes to apportion from the reserve to TACs for the following species: (1) For the BS_81 metric tons (mt) to sablefish;
(2) for the AI_420 mt to sablefish, and 850 mt to the sharpchin/northern rockfish species category; (3) for the Central
Aleutian District_6,679 mt to Atka mackerel; and (4) for the Western Aleutian District_1,500 mt to Atka mackerel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed apportionments are consistent with &sect;675.20(a)(2)(i) and do not result in overfishing of a target
species or the ``other species'' category because the revised TACs are equal to or less than specifications of acceptable
biological catch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to &sect;675.24(c)(1)(i), the proposed apportionment of the BS sablefish is allocated 41 mt to vessels
using hook-and-line or pot gear, and 40 mt to vessels using trawl gear. Pursuant to &sect;675.24(c)(1)(ii), the proposed
apportionment of the AI sablefish is allocated 315 mt to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and 105 mt to vessels
using trawl gear.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to list the Laguna Mountains skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus ruralis lagunae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and quino checkerspot (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha quino
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) butterflies as endangered species throughout their respective ranges in southwestern California and northwestern
Baja California, Mexico pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The Laguna Mountains skipper
occupies two montane meadow habitats in a very restricted range within San Diego County, California. The quino checkerspot
is locally distributed in sunny openings within chaparral and coastal sage shrublands in portions of Riverside County,
California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico. These species are threatened by one or more of the following
factors: Grazing, urban development, collection by lepidopterists and other human disturbance, stochastic events,
and the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms to provide for their conservation. This proposed rule, if made
final, would extend protection under the Act to these species.

The Laguna Mountains skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus ruralis lagunae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is a small butterfly within the skipper family (Hesperiidae). It is about 3 centimeters (cm) (1 inch) in length and
is distinguished from the rural skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. ruralis ruralis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) by extensive white wing markings that give it an overall appearance of white rather than mostly black (Scott 1981).
The Laguna Mountains skipper is found in wet montane meadow habitats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus ruralis lagunae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is one of two recognized subspecies of the rural skipper, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus ruralis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Boisduval). Scott (1981) first described 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus ruralis lagunae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from a collection made in 1956 by F. Thorne in the Laguna Mountains of San Diego County California, based upon population
isolation and color differentiation. The Laguna Mountains skipper is restricted to the Laguna Mountains and Mount
Palomar in San Diego County. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other subspecies of the rural skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus ruralis ruralis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) ranges from the mountains of British Columbia and Alberta south to central California, Nevada, Utah, and northern
Colorado (J. Brown, Dudek and Associates, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992) and has darker wings than the Laguna Mountains skipper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three other species in the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 occur in San Diego County: the common checkered skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. communis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); the small checkered skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. scriptura
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); and the western checkered skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. albescens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The Laguna Mountains skipper can be distinguished from all three of these species by the whitish appearance of the
adults and the use of a single larval host plant in the rose family (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Horkelia clevelandi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Garth and Tilden 1986, Scott 1986). In addition, the western checkered skipper and southern California populations
of the small checkered skipper are restricted to desert areas (Garth and Tilden 1986). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Laguna Mountains skipper is currently found at one site in the Laguna Mountains and one site on Mount Palomar in
San Diego County, California (Dr. John Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992). The total population of the Laguna Mountains skipper is estimated to be fewer than 100 individuals (Murphy
1990; Brown 1991; J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992). The Laguna Mountains population is restricted to a relatively small fenced area where cattle cannot reach
the larval host plant (G. Pratt, as cited 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Murphy 1990; Dave Hogan, San Diego Biodiversity Project, pers. comm., 1993). The Laguna Mountains skipper was sighted
and collected on Mount Palomar in 1991 by D. Lindsley (J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992; Dr. John Brown, pers. comm., 1993). The Mount Palomar population is extremely small where only five specimens
have been reported in this century (J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Horkelia clevelandi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Cleveland's horkelia) is the larval host plant of the Laguna Mountains skipper. Cleveland's horkelia occurs along
the margins of pine meadows in the Laguna, Cuyamaca, Palomar, and San Jacinto Mountains of southwestern California
and northwestern Baja California, Mexico at 1200 to 2500 meters (m) (4000 to 8000 feet) in elevation. Although a butterfly's
distribution is generally defined by the presence of its larval host plant, it may be further restricted by other physiological
or ecological constraints. The Laguna Mountains skipper is currently found in a few open meadows of yellow pine forest
between 1500 to 2000 m (5000 and 6000 feet) in elevation; historically, this species was found at elevations between
1200 and 2500 m (4000 to 6000 feet). It may have occurred throughout the higher elevations of San Diego County (Murphy
1990; Brown 1991; J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992; and references cited therein). Murphy (1990) reported that there were at least six populations of this species
in the Laguna Mountains in the 1950's and 1960's (at Big Laguna, Little Laguna, East Laguna, Laguna Lake, Boiling Springs,
and Horse Heaven) (see also J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992). Most specimens of the Laguna Mountains skipper were collected from Horse Heaven Springs near Mount Laguna
(Murphy 1990). Until rediscovery in 1983 by J. Emmel, the last known sightings of the skipper in the Laguna Mountains
were from 1972. Until specimens were collected in 1991, the last known sightings from Mount Palomar were from 1980
and, prior to that, from 1939 (Brown 1991; J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Laguna Mountains skipper is apparently bivoltine (two generations per year). The adult flight season occurs
from April to May with a complete or partial second brood flight in late June to late July. A partial second brood indicates
that this butterfly may have a flexible or variable diapause (state of suspended activity). The Laguna Mountains
skipper may have evolved a unique mechanism for coping with the low diurnal temperatures it encounters during its
spring flight, which is unusually early for butterflies in the Laguna Mountains (Brown 1991). It is assumed that the
life history of the Laguna Mountains skipper is similar to that of the nominate subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus ruralis ruralis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which diapauses as a full grown larvae and adults live 10 to 20 days (J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
editha quino
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Behr) is a small member of the brush-footed butterfly family (Nymphalidae). It is about 3 cm (1 inch) in length and
checkered with dark brown, reddish, and yellowish spots. It is one of 12 recognized subspecies of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (editha checkerspot) (Garth and Tilden 1986). The quino checkerspot can be distinguished from other subspecies
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by its wing coloration pattern and overall body size. The quino checkerspot tends to be larger with redder wings. The
light spots on the wings tend to be fewer and more disjunct than in the other subspecies (Garth and Tilden 1986). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha quino
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is geographically disjunct from them. This taxon is also phenotypically similar to two other species of butterfly
that occur within its range. The Chalcedon checkerspot (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. chalcedona
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is more yellow and is slightly larger than the quino checkerspot. Gabb's checkerspot (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Chlosyne gabbii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is smaller than the quino checkerspot and has orange instead of red markings (Orsak 1977).

The quino checkerspot was first described in 1863 by Hans Herman Behr, an entomologist with the California Academy
of Sciences in San Francisco, as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Melitaea quino
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 based on a specimen from coastal San Diego County, California. It was subsequently recognized by Comstock (1927)
as a race of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Boisduval). For many years, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. e. quino
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was inappropriately recognized as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. e. wrightii.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This error was rectified by J. Emmel based on a study of Behr's notes and available specimens (D. Murphy, Center for
Conservation Biology, Stanford University, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1988; Allen 1990). The genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which is widely represented throughout North America, has been subdivided into closely related species groups (Scott
1986). The genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is also referred to as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Occidryas,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 but many authors retain the former name (e.g., Scott 1986; Harrison 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1988; Murphy 1990; Brown 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The quino checkerspot is restricted to sunny openings on clay soils formed from gabbro parent materials within shrubland
habitats of the interior foothills of southwestern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico (G. Ballmer,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1991). Similar to the Laguna Mountains skipper and butterflies in general, its distribution is defined primarily
by that of its larval host plant but is further restricted by other factors. The primary larval food plant of the quino
checkerspot is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plantago erecta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (dwarf plantain, family Plantaginaceae). However, the larvae may also use 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plantago insularis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Orthocarpus purpurescens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (owl's clover, family Scrophulariaceae) (White 1974; Greg Ballmer, University of California at Riverside, pers.
comm., 1993). These plants grow in or near meadows, vernal pools, and lake margins in upland shrub communities including
sparse chaparral, and chaparral mixed with coastal sage scrub. This butterfly is generally found at sites where high
densities of the host plant occur (J. Johnson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992) and was found at a variety of elevations from about sea level to about 1200 m (4000 feet). Within these areas,
the quino checkerspot may be preferentially selecting sites where exposure to winter sun is greatest (Allen 1990).
These habitats, like the quino checkerspot butterfly, were once commonly found along coastal bluffs, mesas, and
inland foothills (Brown and Faulkner 1984). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The quino checkerspot may have been one of the most abundant butterflies in San Diego, Orange, and western Riverside
Counties during the early part of the 20th century (Murphy 1990). The original range of the quino checkerspot extended
as far south as Valle de la Trinidad in northwestern Baja California, Mexico, and as far north as Point Dume in Los Angeles
County (Allen 1990). Currently, only six to seven small populations are known within the United States. Five to six
populations occur near Vail Lake in southwestern Riverside and north-central San Diego Counties (G. Ballmer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1990 and 1991; David Hawks, entomologist, University of California at Riverside, pers. comm., 1993). One other
population is known to occur (as of 1991) near Upper Otay Lake in San Diego County (Murphy, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1991). Although the latter population has likely been extirpated (Murphy, pers. comm., 1994). At least one population
exists in Mexico, in the Sierra Juarez near Tecate (Murphy, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1991). Adult quino checkerspot butterflies were not seen at several historically occupied sites in Mexico during
a survey in the spring of 1993 (unpubl. Service data). No estimates of population size for the quino checkerspot are
currently available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adult quino checkerspot butterflies live from 4 to 8 weeks. The flight season occurs from mid-January to late April,
and peaks between March and April. The eggs hatch in about 10 days, and the larvae begin to feed immediately. Fourth
instar (development stage) larvae enter an obligatory diapause, as summer approaches and their larval food plant
senesces. Extended periods of diapause may occur during times of drought (G. Ballmer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1990). Post-diapause larvae develop through four more instars and then pupate to emerge as adults in the early spring
(Murphy and White 1984).

). The petition cited loss and degradation of habitat, through various causes, as the major threat to these butterflies.
On July 12, 1993, the Service found that the petition contained substantial information indicating that the requested
action may be warranted for the Laguna Mountains skipper, but not for the other three butterflies listed above. The
latter finding was made because sufficient information was not available regarding the threats to and biological
vulnerability of these taxa. An announcement of these findings were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 19, 1993 (58 FR 38549). The Laguna Mountains skipper, Hermes copper, Thorne's hairstreak, and Harbison's
dun skipper are currently classified as category 2 candidates for Federal listing (November 21, 1991; 56 FR 58804).
Category 2 includes taxa for which information in the Service's possession indicates that listing is possibly appropriate
but for which the Service lacks substantial information upon which to base a proposal to list as endangered or threatened.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 30, 1988, the Service received a petition dated September 26, 1988, from Dr. Dennis Murphy of the Stanford
University Center for Conservation Biology, to list the quino checkerspot butterfly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha quino
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as endangered under the Act. At the time this petition was submitted, this taxon had not been seen for several years
and was thought to be extinct. Extant populations of the quino checkerspot were reported by Dr. Murphy in a letter dated
August 1, 1991, which again requested the Service to consider the petitioned action. The status of the quino checkerspot
has been under review by the Service since 1984 when it was classified as a category 2 candidate for Federal Listing
(May 22, 1984; 50 FR 37958). This taxon is currently classified as a category 1 candidate (November 21, 1991; 56 FR 58804),
meaning that information in the Service's possession is sufficient to support a proposal to list as endangered or
threatened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule constitutes the final finding for the petitioned action to list the Laguna Mountains skipper as
warranted. In addition, this proposed rule constitutes the 90-day finding that the petition for the quino checkerspot
butterfly presented substantial information that the action may be warranted and the final 12-month finding for
this petition that the action is warranted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement
the Act set forth criteria and procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists. A species may be listed due to any
one or a combination of the five factors listed in section 4(a)(1) of the Act. These factors and their application to
the Laguna Mountains skipper (

A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The habitats and the ranges of the two species considered herein have been substantially reduced by urban and agricultural
development and recreational activities and are further threatened with destruction, modification, and curtailment.
The Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot currently occur within very restricted ranges and are extremely
localized in their present distributions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The habitat requirements for these two butterflies are primarily defined by their larval host plants. The removal
or degradation of these plants, as well as that of nectar sources for adults, leads to the elimination of the affected
population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of the Laguna Mountains skipper, habitat destruction and degradation from overgrazing and trampling
of its larval host plant by domestic cattle is considered to be the primary factor responsible for its decline (Murphy
1990; D. Hogan, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1991; J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992). The larval host plant (Cleveland's horkelia) is itself a rare species and only found in the Laguna, Cuyamaca,
and San Jacinto Mountains of southwestern California, and northwestern Baja California, Mexico. The only known
extant skipper population in the Laguna Mountains is found in the El Prado campground area of the Cleveland National
Forest (Murphy 1990; D. Hogan, pers. comm., 1993). This area is protected from grazing cattle by a fence. Although
the larval host plant is found throughout the campground, it is subject to trampling by people (D. Hogan, pers. comm.,
1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sunny openings within chaparral and coastal sage scrub occupied by the quino checkerspot butterfly have been degraded
by grazing and (to a small degree) destroyed by urban development. Fifty to seventy-five percent of the known range
of the quino checkerspot has been lost since 1900 due to habitat degradation or destruction (Brown 1991). The primary
larval food plant, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plantago erecta,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can be displaced by exotic plants, which invade once the ground is disturbed by discing, grading, and/or grazing (J.
Johnson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1989; G. Ballmer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1990). The food plant then recolonizes in sites where grass does not grow well, like cattle trails and road edges,
where quino checkerspot larvae are subject to trampling (D. Hawks, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The encroachment of urban development in rural Riverside County potentially threatens one of the quino checkerspot
populations near Vail Lake. This area is growing rapidly and is projected to be fully developed within the decade (Monroe
et al. 1992). The Vail Lake area is included in a Community Plan that provides for subdivision of parcels into 20-acre
(9 hectare (ha)) lots (M. Freitas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993). Additional development in this area is expected to further reduce and degrade habitat of the quino checkerspot
through construction of homes and roads, and increases in cattle and horse grazing, fire frequencies, and the distribution
and abundance of exotic plants. An existing recreational vehicle park and marina at Vail Lake attracts unauthorized
use of all terrain vehicles (ATV's) within natural habitat areas. ATV's increase the fire hazard and destroy habitat
through creation of trails. Evidence of ATV use is apparent at one of the quino checkerspot localities near Vail Lake,
where a recently created dirt road bisects the center of the habitat (G. Ballmer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1991). Quino checkerspot habitat at this locality has been disced in part; these disturbed areas no longer support
this species, while the surrounding undisturbed areas do (G. Ballmer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bureau of Land Management-administered lands and Forest Service Wilderness Areas are currently contiguous with
privately-owned quino checkerspot habitat near Vail Lake. As Riverside County becomes more densely populated,
fragmentation and degradation of this contiguous habitat is expected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any residual individuals remaining near the last known population of the quino checkerspot in San Diego County would
be threatened by a proposed urban development project on Otay Mesa. The preferred alternative for the Otay Ranch New
Town Plan (the largest planned community in the southwestern United States) would result in the loss of 5,600 ha (14,000
acres) of upland shrub communities, or about 52 percent of their extent within the project area. The effects of this
project on the quino checkerspot are not known at this time but may be significant. Habitat loss due to grazing and clay
mining are the primary threats to the quino checkerspot butterfly in Mexico.

B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Overcollection is a potential threat to both the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot because they
are rare butterflies. Johnson (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1989) has noted that the number of quino checkerspot colonies has been reduced since lepidopterists, eager to include
rare species in their collections and to obtain surplus specimens for exchange or sale to other lepidopterists, have
visited the few remaining colonies steadily throughout the flight season. ``Where the populations may already be
small, this depredation by collectors may so weaken the colonies as to end their existence. I have witnessed examples
of this with other species of Lepidoptera whose loss of habitat has restricted the species to isolated colonies. These
have then been wiped out by intensive collection by lepidopterists.'' (J. Johnson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1989). The remaining populations of the quino checkerspot butterfly near Vail Lake are threatened by overcollection.
In the spring of 1993, these populations were the subject of scientific collections for voucher specimens and captive-rearing
(D. Hawks, pers. comm., 1993). In addition, at least two collections of about six specimens each have been made by private
collectors for non-scientific purposes (unpubl. Service data).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A significant threat to the survival of both species considered herein is the potential for vandalism by landowners
who may view the presence of sensitive species as an obstacle to development. The habitat of the largest and most dense
quino checkerspot population in the Gavilan Hills of Riverside County was deliberately disced, in 1984 or 1985, to
eliminate this population (J. Johnson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1989).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Disease or Predation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Disease is not known to be a factor affecting the species considered herein. There are no known predators of the Laguna
Mountains skipper. However, there is evidence that predation is a threat to the quino checkerspot. Studies conducted
by David Hawks (pers. comm., 1993) indicate that predation has contributed to the decline of the quino checkerspot
at sites where habitat has been invaded by non-native plant species, which may also harbor predatory arthropods.
Historical quino checkerspot habitat sites that have been heavily invaded by Mediterranean plant species also have
high sowbug (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Oniscus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
sp.) and earwig (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Forficula 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
sp.) densities. Sowbugs and earwigs prey upon butterfly eggs. These predators, as well as the non-native plant species
that support them, are absent from natural sites currently occupied by the quino checkerspot butterfly (D. Hawks,
pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although specific parasites are unknown for the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot, Johnson (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1989) speculates that parasitism can eliminate a butterfly colony. ``*&blank;*&blank;* butterfly or moth populations
will build up on the food plants for three or four years, then one will begin to find examples of larvae or pupae with parasites.
The parasitism increases for two or three seasons, when nearly all of the larvae or pupae are affected, the moth or butterfly
population disappears completely from the observed area, remains absent for some years, then the cycle is repeated''
(J. Johnson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1989). This cycle can only continue if the affected area is recolonized, which is difficult when the host-butterfly
population is small, fragmented, and isolated. In general, however, outbreaks of disease or parasitism are more
likely to occur under conditions of high population densities. The Laguna Mountains skipper occurs in low population
densities; most populations of the Quino checkerspot also occur at low densities.

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Existing regulatory mechanisms that could provide some protection for both the Laguna Mountains skipper and the
quino checkerspot include: (1) Listing under the California Endangered Species Act; (2) adequate consideration
under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); (3) local
laws and regulations; (4) occurrence with other species protected by the Federal Endangered Species Act; and (5)
land acquisition and management by Federal, State, or local agencies, or by private groups and organizations for
the conservation of these species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither of the species discussed herein is under consideration for listing under the California Endangered Species
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The status of and threats to the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot, as discussed under Factor A above,
reflect the failure of CEQA, NEPA, and local laws and regulations to protect and provide for the conservation of these
species. Although there are several regional conservation planning efforts underway within the range of the Laguna
Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot, none have been completed, approved, funded, or implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is not aware of any overlap in distribution between the Laguna Mountains skipper and any State or Federally
listed species. At some localities, the quino checkerspot co-occurs with the coastal California gnatcatcher (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Polioptila californica californica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), a Federally listed threatened species. However, the habitat requirements for the quino checkerspot are different
than for the gnatcatcher. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some protection is afforded to the Laguna Mountains skipper on Forest Service land. However, this protection is limited
to a campground area that is subject to human disturbance. Considering the small population size and extremely limited
distribution of the Laguna Mountains skipper, this protection is insufficient to conserve the species. In the case
of the quino checkerspot, some protection may be provided to one population by its occurrence, in part, on Bureau of
Land Management land near Vail Lake in Riverside County. However, this Federal land is currently subject to off-road
vehicle activity (G. Ballmer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is not aware of any regulatory mechanisms that protect the quino checkerspot in Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Other Natural or Man-Made Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The extremely restricted range and localized distribution, and small population size of the Laguna Mountains skipper
and the quino checkerspot makes them vulnerable to the effects of fragmentation, especially with regard to stochastic
events (e.g., see Gilpin and Soule 1986). For example, the Mount Palomar population of the Laguna Mountains skipper
is known from one site, where five specimens were taken. A chance event could easily extirpate this population of the
skipper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although both butterflies occur in fire adapted ecosystems, a single fire event could eliminate affected populations.
Orsak (1977) reported that a quino checkerspot population near Hidden Ranch, Black Star Canyon, in the Santa Ana Mountains
of Orange County was apparently destroyed by a fire in 1967. (As discussed in the Background section above, the quino
checkerspot is now extirpated from Orange County.) The only site known to be occupied by the Laguna Mountains skipper
in the Laguna Mountains is subject to cattle grazing and trampling by both cattle and people.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interconnected populations can act as reservoirs to maintain populations that may be subject to periodic extirpation
(Murphy and White 1984, Harrison et. al 1988). If a stochastic event eliminates a population of either species (due
to factors discussed in this rule), few (if any) neighboring populations are available to recolonize the area. No
information is available regarding the vagility of the Laguna Mountains skipper. The sedentary behavior of the quino
checkerspot diminishes the probability that natural, long distance dispersal could reestablish most extirpated
local populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Periodic droughts (like those recently occurring in southwestern California) can adversely affect both of the species
considered herein. Drought is known to decrease numbers of butterflies (Thorne 1963). Drought conditions may cause
loss or early senescence of the larval host plant prior to completion of larval development, or lower the nutritional
quality of the host plant (e.g., water content). Drought can also reduce the quantity and quality of adult nectar sources.
Larval starvation and extirpation of local populations during periods of drought have been documented for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (White 1974, Ehrlich et al. 1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Habitat fragmentation can affect the genetic heterogeneity of small isolated populations like those of the Laguna
Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot. Small, fragmented populations are subject to a higher frequency of
genetic drift and inbreeding. As a consequence, genetic variation of the population and individual heterozygosity
is decreased. That can lead to inbreeding depression and lowered fitness of individuals. Low genetic diversity may
decrease the ability of a species to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Genetically homogenous populations
may be at a greater risk of extinction from environmental or demographic stochasticity (e.g., from fire or drought
events) than are large, diverse populations that can more readily recover from such events. For example, variation
in the length of diapause among butterfly offspring requires genetic heterogeneity (see Seger and Brockman 1987).
If a population is variable in diapause length, it has a lower risk of losing an entire cohort to adverse environmental
conditions during any given season. Individuals with prolonged diapause may survive if drought causes high mortality
during the next season. A large population or metapopulation can maintain the genetic heterogeneity needed to maintain
the population during these kinds of events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The quino checkerspot is somewhat adapted to unpredictable weather patterns but requires sufficient patches of
suitable habitat to respond to this environmental stochasticity. The quino checkerspot's dispersal capabilities
vary considerably depending upon rainfall patterns and the resulting availability of adult nectar sources and larval
food plants. For example, a San Diego County population of the quino checkerspot exhibited an increase in numbers
as a result of favorable weather (Murphy and White 1984). The greater number of larvae defoliated the larval food plants.
This central core area was left without sufficient egg-laying sites for females, and adults went for greater dispersal
distances in search of additional suitable habitat. Ideally these dispersing adults would have found marginally
suitable areas, and in subsequent generations would have returned to a central core area. In this case, the mass dispersal
failed to restore populations in previously occupied habitat, and the butterflies have not re-colonized the original
site (Murphy and White 1984; Murphy, pers. comm. 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by these two taxa in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,
the Service finds that the preferred action is to list the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot as endangered.
The range and habitat of these species has been substantially reduced by historical activities associated with urban
and agricultural development and recreational activities. These two taxa are threatened by one or more of the following
factors: Habitat alteration and destruction resulting from urban and agricultural development, grazing, overcollection,
recreational activities, inadequate regulatory mechanisms, and displacement of the larval host plant by exotic
species. The extremely restricted range, localized distribution, and small population size of both butterflies
makes them very vulnerable to extinction by the factors listed above as well as by stochastic events such as fire and
drought. For these reasons, the Service finds that the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot are in imminent
danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges. Threatened status would not accurately
reflect the diminished status and threats to these species. Other alternatives to this action were considered but
not preferred because not listing these species would not provide adequate protection and would be inconsistent
with the purposes of the Act. Critical habitat is not being proposed for these taxa for the reasons discussed below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical habitat, as defined by section 3(5)(A) of the Act, means: (i) The specific areas within the geographical
area occupied by a species, at the time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found those physical or biological
features (I) essential to the conservation of the species and (II) that may require special management considerations
or protection; and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by a species at the time it is listed,
upon a determination that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that critical habitat be designated to the maximum extent prudent and determinable
concurrently with the determination that a species is endangered or threatened. The Service's regulations (50 CFR
424.12(a)(1)) state that designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of the following situations
exist: (1) The species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and identification of critical habitat can
be expected to increase the degree of such threat to the species; or (2) such designation of critical habitat would
not be beneficial to the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent at this time for the Laguna Mountains skipper
and the quino checkerspot. The quino checkerspot, mostly occurs on privately owned lands with little or no Federal
involvement, although the Bureau of Land Management owns a portion of one site. The additional protection provided
by the designation of critical habitat to a species is only achieved through section 7. Therefore, the designation
of critical habitat would not appreciably benefit the quino checkerspot. Publication of precise maps and descriptions
of critical habitat for the quino checkerspot and the Laguna Mountains skipper could result in additional habitat
destruction through trampling, discing, and grading as well as collection. As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary
of Factors Affecting the Species'' section of this proposal, habitat for the one of the largest quino checkerspot
colonies was graded in Riverside County to deliberately eliminate that population, and a number of quino checkerspot
colonies have been subject to collection by lepidopterists for trading and similar purposes.

Available Conservation Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with
the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal
agencies and the prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If
a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize,
fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or destroy or adversely modify
its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal
agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal agencies expected to have involvement with the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot include
the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management due to the presence of habitat and populations within their jurisdiction.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service may need to evaluate the effects of its activities on the quino checkerspot,
which is known to occur near the international border in San Diego County.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions
that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to take (including harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or
to attempt any of these), import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial
activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It is also illegal to possess,
sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply
to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered wildlife species under
certain circumstances. Regulations governing such permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available
for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in connection
with otherwise lawful activities. In some instances involving trade, permits may be issued for a specified time to
relieve undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such relief were not available. The Laguna Mountains skipper
and quino checkerspot are not involved in trade, and such permit requests are not expected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for copies of the regulations on listed wildlife and plants and inquiries regarding them should be addressed
to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services_Endangered Species Permits, 911 Northeast 11th Ave,
Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (telephone 503/231&hyph;6241).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to list the San Diego fairy shrimp (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Branchinecta sandiegoensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) as endangered throughout its range in southwestern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico, pursuant
to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This species occurs in vernal pools and is threatened by a variety
of factors including: Habitat destruction and fragmentation from agricultural and urban development, alterations
of wetland hydrology by draining, off-road vehicle activity, and cattle and sheep grazing. This proposed rule, if
made final, would extend the Act's protection to the San Diego fairy shrimp.

) is a member of Branchinectidae, a freshwater crustacean family in the Order Anostraca (fairy shrimp). The species
was first described by Michael Fugate (1993) based on collections made at Del Mar Mesa in San Diego County in 1990 by
himself and M. Simovich. The San Diego fairy shrimp is closely allied with, and has historically been misidentified
as, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. lindahli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a species widely distributed in western North America. The San Diego fairy shrimp was first collected (but then identified
as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. lindahli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in Poway and Ramona, San Diego County, in 1962; additional collections were made on Kearny Mesa in 1979 (Simovich
and Fugate 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Diego fairy shrimp is restricted to vernal pools, which occur in areas with shallow depressions that have a
clay hardpan soil layer that inhibits water percolation. This results in a perched water table during the winter rainy
season and the following spring. Vernal pools retain water only long enough to support relatively few species of aquatic
emergent plants and invertebrates. As the pools dry and the surface water recedes toward the center of the pool, a unique
and dynamic flora develops in its place. Vernal pools typically occur on mesa tops or valley floors and are surrounded
by very low hills, usually referred to as mima mounds (Zedler 1987). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Diego fairy shrimp is a small and delicate animal with large stalked compound eyes, no carapace, and 11 pairs
of swimming legs. Mature males are from 9 to 16 mm (0.4 to 0.6 in) in length and females are 8 to 14 mm (0.4 to 0.5 in) in length.
They swim or glide upside down by means of complex beating movements of the legs that pass in a wave-like anterior to
posterior direction. The second pair of antennae on the adult female are cylindrical and elongate, but in the male
are greatly enlarged and specialized for clasping the female during copulation. The female carries the eggs in an
oval or elongate ventral brood sac. The eggs are either released or remain attached to the female until she dies and
sinks. The thick-shelled eggs are capable of withstanding high heat, cold, and prolonged desiccation.

The San Diego fairy shrimp occurs in San Diego County from San Marcos and Ramona south to Otay Mesa and at Valle de Palmas
in northwestern Baja California, Mexico. All known localities are below 700 meters (2,300 feet) and within 50 kilometers
(30 miles) of the Pacific coast. Five other branchinectid fairy shrimp occur in southern California. Only one of these
species, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Branchinecta lindahli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, is known from San Diego County (Simovich and Fugate 1992). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. lindahli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a habitat generalist and may occur in ponds or ditches. The only other branchinectid fairy shrimp in southern California
that is similar in appearance to the San Diego fairy shrimp is the vernal pool fairy shrimp (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. lynchi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which occurs in adjacent Riverside County. Male San Diego fairy shrimp may be separated from males of other species
within the genus by the shape of the second antenna. Female San Diego fairy shrimp are distinguishable by the shape
and length of the ovisac and egg and by the presence of paired dorsolateral spines (Fugate 1993). The San Diego fairy
shrimp is a habitat specialist and is restricted to vernal pools. This species occasionally occurs in ditches and
road ruts, but only if these depressions are in degraded vernal pool habitat (D. Hogan, San Diego Biodiversity Project,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992; Marie Simovich, University of San Diego, pers. comm., 1993). This species appears to prefer cool water temperatures
ranging from 10 to 23 degrees centigrade (Fugate and Simovich 1992). The prehistorical distribution of this species
is uncertain. The majority of the vernal pools in this region were lost prior to 1990. However, based on historical
collections (some originally identified as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. lindahli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) the San Diego fairy shrimp was known from at least 15 locales within San Diego County (Balko and Ebert 1987, Fugate
1993). The fairy shrimp presently occurs in fewer than 70 vernal pools within 11 vernal pool complexes in coastal San
Diego County (Hogan 1992). Three of the San Diego County populations of this species are on Federal land (all on Miramar
Naval Air Station). Two others are, in part, on public land (Del Mar Mesa Vernal Pool Preserve and Mission Trails Regional
Park). The San Diego fairy shrimp has also been reported from Isla Vista in Santa Barbara County, California, but the
identification of the single female individual is unconfirmed (Michael Fugate, University of Oregon, pers. comm.,
1993). Directed surveys of vernal pools in Isla Vista for fairy shrimp have not located any additional San Diego fairy
shrimp individuals (Marie Simovich, pers. comm., 1994). The vernal pools in south coastal Santa Barbara County have
been significantly reduced in number by the same factors that have reduced the number of vernal pools in San Diego County
(Ferren and Pritchett 1988). The Santa Barbara County vernal pools are now isolated from those in San Diego County
by agricultural and urban development in Ventura, Los Angeles, and Orange Counties.

Previous Federal Action 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 24, 1992, the Service received a petition to list the San Diego fairy shrimp as endangered. Petitioners were
Dave Hogan of the San Diego Biodiversity Project in Julian, California, and Denton Belk of Our Lady of the Lake University
in San Antonio, Texas. The Service finds that substantial information was presented in the petition to indicate that
the requested action may be warranted. This finding is based on a detailed narrative justification in the petition
for the recommended action, including information about the distribution, decline, and threats to this species
over a significant portion of its range. This proposed rule is the first Federal action on the San Diego fairy shrimp
and constitutes the final 1-year finding on the petitioned action that the action is warranted, as required by section
4(b)(3)(B) of the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures
for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to
one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the San Diego fairy
shrimp (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range The natural plant
communities of coastal San Diego County and northwestern Baja California, Mexico, have undergone significant changes
as a result of both direct and indirect human-caused activities. The rapid urbanization of this region has already
eliminated a significant proportion of the vernal pool habitat for this taxon. The remaining patches of habitat are
frequently isolated, degraded, and/or fragmented by agricultural practices, streambed channelization and other
hydrological alterations, and grazing. Vernal pools have undergone an extraordinary reduction in number and have
nearly been eliminated in southern California. In San Diego County, over 97 percent of vernal pool habitat had been
lost by 1986 (Bauder 1986). While it is uncertain how many of these pools were occupied by the San Diego fairy shrimp,
the species was known to occupy a number of vernal pools that have since been disturbed, destroyed or lost (Bauder 1986,
Balko and Ebert 1987, Fugate 1993). In San Diego County, the San Diego fairy shrimp occurs within vernal pool complexes
that have been and continue to be impacted by urbanization and agricultural conversion (Bauder 1986, Hogan and Belk
1992, Nancy Gilbert and Ellen Berryman, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993). Nine of the 11 known populations
of San Diego fairy shrimp in San Diego County are declining because of vernal pool destruction (Bauder 1986; D. Hogan,
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992; Marie Simovich, pers. comm., 1993). At least two populations of the San Diego fairy shrimp occur on Otay Mesa
in San Diego County. A minimum of 37 proposed Precise Plans and Tentative Maps for development have been filed pursuant
to the California Environmental Quality Act for this area. These plans encompass about 80 percent of the undeveloped
portion of the mesa within the jurisdiction of the city of San Diego and virtually all but four of the remaining vernal
pool complexes. Several of these projects will impact the San Diego fairy shrimp. At least one major transportation
project has been proposed for Otay Mesa and could potentially impact vernal pools that are occupied by the San Diego
fairy shrimp. The San Diego fairy shrimp is found on Federal lands managed by the Navy. The species occurs on Miramar
Naval Air Station. These lands are used, in part, for military training activities that involve off-road vehicle
maneuvers that adversely impact the species (Hogan and Belk 1992).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Trash dumping has also degraded vernal pools in San Diego County. Discarded chunks of concrete, tires, refrigerators,
furniture, and other pieces of garbage or debris have been found in pools containing the San Diego fairy shrimp. This
trash crushes or shades vernal pool plants, disrupts the hydrologic functions of the pool, and in some cases, may release
toxic substances. Vernal pools in San Diego County have also been degraded by off-road vehicles. These vehicles compact
soils, crush plants when water is present, cause turbidity, and leave deep ruts. This type of damage may alter the microhydrology
of the pools. Dirt roads that go through or adjacent to pools are widened as motorists try to avoid mud puddles and in
this way, the pools are gradually destroyed. The San Diego fairy shrimp's vernal pool habitat is also vulnerable to
indirect destruction due to the alteration of the supporting watershed. An increase in water due to urban run-off
leads to increased inundation and makes pools vulnerable to invasion by marshy plant species resulting in decreased
abundance of obligate vernal pool taxa. At the other extreme, some pools have been drained or blocked from their source
of water and have shown an increased domination by upland plant species. The San Diego fairy shrimp is especially vulnerable
to alterations in hydrology. Development projects adjacent to vernal pools are often responsible for adverse alterations
in drainage. Hydrological alterations are sometimes a result of agricultural development, or a combination of urban
development and agriculture. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes Overutilization is not
currently a known threat factor for the San Diego fairy shrimp. C. Disease or Predation As vernal pools mature, there
is a gradual increase in numbers and size of predaceous aquatic insects, known to consume fairy shrimp (Zedler 1987).
D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms Existing regulatory mechanisms that could provide some protection
for the San Diego fairy shrimp include: (1) Consideration under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA);
(2) implementation of conservation plans pursuant to the State of California's Natural Community Conservation
Planning Act of 1991 (NCCP), the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan (MSCP), and the San Diego County Multiple
Habitat Conservation Plan (MHCP); (3) section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act; (4) occurrence with other species
protected by the Federal Endangered Species Act; (5) land acquisition and management by Federal, State, or local
agencies, or by private groups and organizations; (6) local laws and regulations; and (7) Mexican law. Most of the
known populations of the taxon occur on privately owned land. Local lead agencies empowered to uphold and enforce
the regulations of the CEQA have made determinations that have or will adversely affect the San Diego fairy shrimp.
Required biological surveys are often inadequate and project proponents may ignore the results of surveys if occurrences
of sensitive species are viewed as a constraint on project design. Mitigation measures used to condition project
approvals are essentially experimental and fail to adequately guarantee protection of sustainable populations.
For example, in San Diego County, vernal pools containing the San Diego fairy shrimp and the Federal- and State-listed
Pogogyne abramsii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (San Diego mesa mint) were destroyed without adequate environmental documentation or coordination with the Service
and the California Department of Fish and Game. In this case, the project proponent was a school district. Section
15380 of CEQA requires that impacts to any taxon that meets the criteria for listing under the California Endangered
Species Act be treated as significant regardless of its current listing status. The San Diego fairy shrimp has been
recognized as a distinct taxon by the scientific and local conservation communities since 1990. Impacts to this species
would qualify as significant under section 15380 of CEQA even though this species was not formally recognized until
1993 (Fugate 1993). However, this taxon has only been considered in a limited number of environmental impact reports
since 1990.

In 1991, the State of California established the NCCP program to address the conservation needs of natural ecosystems
throughout the State. The initial focus of this program was the coastal sage scrub community. The San Diego fairy shrimp
is found in vernal pools and not coastal sage scrub. The San Diego fairy shrimp is being considered under the MSCP and
MHCP programs. These programs, under development by the County of San Diego and its coastal cities, are being integrated
as components of the NCCP program. However, these programs are still in the developmental phase, and it is uncertain
as to what degree they will be successful in providing protection for this species. For example, two alternatives
of the MSCP (coastal sage scrub and public lands) would not provide adequate preservation for the San Diego fairy shrimp
because much of the shrimp's habitat (vernal pools) would be excluded.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates the discharge of fill into
waters of the United States, including navigable waters, wetlands (e.g., vernal pools), and other waters. The Clean
Water Act requires project proponents to obtain a permit from the Corps prior to undertaking many activities (e.g.,
grading, discharge of soil or other fill material, etc.) that would result in the fill of wetlands under the Corps'
jurisdiction. The Corps promulgated Nationwide Permit Number 26 (see 33 CFR 330.5(a)(26)) to address fill of isolated
or headwater wetlands totalling less than 10 acres. Under Nationwide Permit 26, proposals that involve the fill of
wetlands less than one acre are considered authorized. Where fill would adversely modify between 1 to 10 acres of wetland,
the Corps circulates a predischarge notification to the Service and other interested parties for comment to determine
whether or not an individual permit should be required for a proposed fill activity and associated impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual permits are required for the discharge of fill material that would fill or adversely modify greater than
10 acres of wetlands. The review process for the issuance of individual permits is more rigorous than for nationwide
permits. Unlike nationwide permits, an analysis of cumulative wetland impacts is required for individual permit
applications. Resulting permits may include special conditions that require the avoidance or mitigation of environmental
impacts. On nationwide permits, the Corps has discretionary authority to require an applicant to seek an individual
permit if the Corps believes that the resources are sufficiently important, regardless of the wetland's size. In
practice, the Corps rarely requires an individual permit when a project would qualify for a nationwide permit, unless
when a threatened or endangered species or other significant resources would be adversely affected by the proposed
activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Diego fairy shrimp could potentially be affected by projects requiring a permit from the Corps under section
404 of the Clean Water Act. Although the objective of the Clean Water Act is to ``restore and maintain the chemical,
physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters'' (Pub. L. 92&hyph;500), which include navigable and
isolated waters, headwaters, and adjacent wetlands, no specific provisions adequately address the need to conserve
candidate species such as the San Diego fairy shrimp.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even if the Corps establishes jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act over vernal pools, this does not ensure their
protection. At least two vernal pool complexes under Corps jurisdiction in San Diego County have been destroyed or
degraded without a section 404 permit (Jim Dice, Calif. Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm., 1993; U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service data files).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

) are listed as endangered under the Act and occur in the same habitat as the San Diego fairy shrimp. However, these species
are generally not found in the same vernal pool complexes as the San Diego fairy shrimp. The Riverside fairy shrimp
and San Diego fairy shrimp co-exist in only three vernal pool complexes in San Diego County. Within a vernal pool complex,
the San Diego fairy shrimp does not often occur in the same pools as listed species.

Land acquisition and management by Federal, State, or local agencies, or by private groups and organizations has
contributed to the protection of some localities inhabited by this taxon. However, as discussed below, these efforts
are often directed at other species and are inadequate to assure the long-term survival of the San Diego fairy shrimp.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Diego fairy shrimp occurs within the California Department of Transportation Vernal Pool Preserve. Although
these pools are managed for the long-term protection of vernal pool flora and fauna, off-road vehicle activity, development
proposals immediately adjacent to the preserve, and proposed restoration actions threaten the San Diego fairy shrimp
at this locality (Hogan and Belk 1992; M. Simovich, pers. comm., 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Diego fairy shrimp also occurs in northwestern Baja California, Mexico. The Service is not aware of any existing
regulatory mechanisms in Mexico that would protect the San Diego fairy shrimp or its habitat.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cattle grazing occurs on Otay Mesa in areas where several vernal pool complexes contain the San Diego fairy shrimp.
Livestock grazing typically changes the composition of native plant communities by reducing or eliminating those
species that can not withstand trampling and by enabling more resistant (usually non-native) species to increase
in abundance. Taxa that were not previously part of the native flora may be introduced and flourish under a grazing
regime and may reduce or replace native species through competition for resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disturbance of vernal pools in San Diego County increases the potential for other fairy shrimp species (such as the
widespread 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Branchinecta lindahli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to replace the San Diego fairy shrimp, which is unable to persist under disturbed conditions (M. Simovich, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., University of San Diego, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
San Diego fairy shrimp are highly reliant on seasonal rainfall. Drier conditions, such as those that prevailed from
1986 to 1992, reduce the number of individuals in populations. Climatic conditions stress species. Negative effects
of habitat loss and degradation from other factors including development, discing, and grazing, when combined with
climatic conditions, increase the level of threat to the San Diego fairy shrimp.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by the San Diego fairy shrimp in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,
the Service finds that the preferred action is to list the San Diego fairy shrimp as endangered. The San Diego fairy
shrimp is threatened by one or more of the following factors: Habitat alteration and destruction resulting from urban
and agricultural development; alteration of hydrology; off-road vehicle use/recreational activities; inadequate
regulatory mechanisms; and grazing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Diego fairy shrimp is in imminent danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
Critical habitat is not being proposed for this taxon for the reasons discussed below.

Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time the taxon is listed. Critical habitat is not determinable if insufficient
information exists to perform an economic impact analysis of designating a particular area as critical habitat,
or if the biological needs of the species are not sufficiently well known to permit identification of an area as critical
habitat (50 CFR 424.12(a)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is in the process of defining critical habitat and determining more clearly what the ecological requirements
and constituent elements are for the San Diego fairy shrimp. The Service may find that determination of critical habitat
is not prudent for this taxon, however, at this time designation of critical habitat is not determinable.

Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with
the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal
agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants and animals are discussed, in
part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If
a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize,
fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or destroy or adversely modify
its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal
agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal agencies expected to have involvement with the San Diego fairy shrimp include the Army Corps of Engineers
and the Environmental Protection Agency due to their permit authority under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The
San Diego fairy shrimp occurs on the U.S. Navy's Miramar Air Station. This base will likely be involved through military
activities or potential excessing of Federal lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of prohibitions and exceptions that
apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to take (including harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or
to attempt any of these), import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial
activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species of wildlife. It is also illegal
to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions
apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered wildlife species under
certain circumstances. Regulations governing such permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available
for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in connection
with otherwise lawful activities. In some instances involving trade, permits may be issued for a specified time to
relieve undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such relief were not available. The San Diego fairy shrimp
is not involved in trade, and such permit requests are not expected.

Requests for copies of the requirements and regulations on permits or trade in wildlife and plants and inquiries regarding
them should be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits,

 (Parish's meadowfoam) as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened throughout their respective ranges in southwestern California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species occur in vernally moist soils of montane wet meadows, near 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
springs and seeps, or vernal pools within the Peninsular Ranges of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
southwestern California. These plants are imperiled by a variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors including alteration of wetland hydrology, cattle grazing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recreational activities, recreational development, off-road vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity, and competition from exotic plant species. This proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, if made final, would extend protection under the Act to these two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants. Critical habitat is not being proposed at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional data and information, which may assist the Service in making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a final decision on this proposed action, is solicited on the status of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these species.

type of physiography is referred to as a montane meadow-vernal pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The largest populations of both taxa are located within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cuyamaca Valley in the Cuyamaca Mountains of central San Diego County, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California. Although the vernal pool and mima mound topography is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mostly obliterated, much of the unique, montane, vernal pool flora 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains. This flora includes a number of disjunct species that are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently associated with vernal pools of coastal San Diego County or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
central California (e.g.,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, a depression at the southwestern end of the Cuyamaca 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Valley formed a small lake that dried up in the summer. This area was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to as ``Laguna Que Se Seca'' (the lake that dries up) (Allen and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Curto 1987). This area and the rest of the valley supported a complex 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of vernal pools and mima mounds. A dam was built in 1886 at the Boulder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Creek outlet of Cuyamaca Lake. The dam created a permanent reservoir 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known as Cuyamaca Lake. A dike built in 1967 allowed water to be pumped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the reservoir so that the valley could be kept in a flooded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition throughout the summer (Ball et al., unpub. man.). In wet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years, the reservoir and dike system allows the entire valley to remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flooded for extended periods (Bauder 1992). Many areas supporting these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxa have been moderately to heavily grazed in the past and some areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be adversely affected by livestock and horses. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heavy grazing in the Laguna Mountains since the 1880's has resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the increased abundance of introduced annual grasses and forbs, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scarcity of organic matter, and severe gullying and erosion (Sproul 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1979).

 was located throughout much of the valley floor. This population has now been largely restricted to the shore of the
lake, penetrating into the valley floor during dry years. From 1988 to 1992 one population existed in the vicinity
of Cuyamaca Lake, consisting of between 9 and 24 stands. Combined, these stands occupied less than 200 acres and frequently
occupied less than 100 acres. The number of individuals within these stands, and the location and size of these stands
vary in any given year in response to rainfall, the extent of winter flooding, and temperature (Bauder 1992).

 is a member of the meadowfoam family (Limnanthaceae), a small family of wetland species found primarily along the
Pacific coast of North America. The plant is a low, widely branching annual with stems 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in) long. The
leaves are 2 to 6 cm (0.5 to 2 in) long and divided. The flowers are bowl-shaped, the petals are 8 to 10 mm (0.25 to 0.5 in)
long with a white or occasionally with a cream-colored base that becomes pink (Ornduff 1993). The fruit is rough textured.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were included in 1983 and 1985 supplements to the Notice of Review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plants as category 2 candidate taxa (species for which data in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended in 1982, requires the Secretary to make findings on pending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitions within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13, 1982 be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. This

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because the 1975 Smithsonian report had been accepted as a petition. On October 13, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of this species was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranted but precluded by other pending listing proposals of higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priority, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act. Notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this finding was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 20, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the petition to be recycled, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 64828&hyph;45). One reason was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited as the basis for this finding on this species that was based upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data not then available to the Service in late summer 1993: current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threats (i.e., the five factors described below under 50 CFR 424.11) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout a significant portion of the species' range. The species was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retained in Category 2 on the basis that it may be subject to extinction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or endangerment from uncontrolled loss of habitat or from other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
man-caused changes to its environment (58 FR 64840). Since the summer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1993, the Service has completed or obtained survey and other data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that adequately describe those factors that are placing

. The habitat for both these taxa is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened by recreational developments, off-road vehicle use, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trampling, alterations of hydrology and the introduction of exotic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, montane wet meadow and vernal pool habitats were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
much more abundant in the Peninsular Ranges of San Diego County (Winter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991). The wet meadows surrounding Cuyamaca Lake reservoir support the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The entire Cuyamaca Valley was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
originally a montane meadow-vernal pool complex. Dredging during dam 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction in 1886 altered the natural topography of the valley and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its vernal pools. Mima mounds were likely excavated since ``much of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earth used for the dam was taken from the meadow north of the dam and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the valley floor'' (Allen and Curto 1987). Later, 160 ha (400 ac) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the valley outside the reservoir was leased from Helix Water District 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and planted in grain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Loss of wet meadow habitat continues as a result of excessive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water inundation at Cuyamaca Lake reservoir and within Cuyamaca Valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above the dike. Studies of

, conducted between 1988 and 1992, have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated that extended inundation at Cuyamaca Lake caused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extirpation of stands for these two species (Bauder 1992). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reservoir provides domestic water, flood control, and recreational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities such as fishing and duck hunting. These uses are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered through agreements between the Helix Water District, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
City of San Diego's El Capitan Reservoir, and Lake Cuyamaca Recreation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Park District (Bauder 1992). Approximately 81 ha (150 ac) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential meadow habitat are permanently inundated. The system of dikes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built in 1967 allows an additional 273 ha (675 ac) to be inundated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended periods of time during periods of high precipitation; that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred as recently as 1993 (Hugh Marks, Cuyamaca Lake Recreation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

inundation (Bauder 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A variety of indirect impacts are associated with the diversion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water entering the Cuyamaca Lake reservoir basin. Diversion often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in the alteration of small drainages by down cutting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streambank erosion, which contributes to the loss of potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable habitat upstream of Cuyamaca Lake. Fluctuating lake levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also increase channel erosion by changing the gradient and velocity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrounding drainages. Erosion is further intensified by the decrease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in groundwater levels caused by numerous wells in the area. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streamflow velocities are high, Downingia 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limnanthes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
seeds and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants can be buried or washed away. In dry years, meadows exposed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the receding shoreline dry prematurely as the groundwater level falls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Roads without adequate culverts also divert water flow. Road 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance and herbicidal weed abatement often preclude the re-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishment of seeds in areas of suitable habitat (Bauder 1992). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the alteration of hydrology in Cuyamaca Valley promotes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invasion of exotic species (e.g., Lolium perenne (ryegrass) and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pratensis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(Kentucky bluegrass)) known to displace native plant species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These indirect effects can have significant, long-term impacts on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meadow habitats and associated sensitive plant species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Direct loss of both species' habitat at the reservoir is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial. For example, a parking lot and a campground on the south 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of Cuyamaca Lake reservoir at Los Caballos have displaced habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Bauder 1992). The Prado campground on the Cleveland National Forest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also displaced

.). After the California Department of Fish and Game 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifies a landowner that a State-listed plant occurs on his or her

property, the Fish and Game Code requires only that the landowner notify

the agency ``at least 10 days in advance of changing the land use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow salvage of such plant'' (Chapter 10, section 1913, California Fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Game Code). Therefore, although NPPA and CESA both prohibit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``take'' of State-listed plants (Chapter 10, sections 1908 and Chapter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.5, section 2080, California Fish and Game Code), these statutes are

not adequate to protect the taking of such plants via habitat

modification or land use change by the landowner.

The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources Code, section 21000 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires full disclosure of the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects. The public agency with primary
authority or jurisdiction over the project is designated as the lead agency and is responsible for conducting a review
of the project and for consulting with the other agencies concerned with the resources affected by the project. CEQA
documentation is often inadequate or incomplete, and compliance with CEQA is not monitored. Section 15065 of the
CEQA Guidelines requires a finding of significance if a project has the potential to ``reduce the number or restrict
the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal.'' However, even if significant effects are identified, the lead
agency has the option to require mitigation through changes in the project or to decide that ``overriding social and
economic considerations'' make mitigation infeasible (California Public Resources Code, Guidelines, section
15093). In the latter case, projects may be approved that cause significant environmental damage, such as destruction
of endangered plant species. Protection of listed plant species under CEQA is therefore dependent upon the discretion
of the lead agency, hence, this is not adequate to ensure the survival of a species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District is the lead agency that is empowered to uphold and enforce CEQA regulations
at Cuyamaca Lake reservoir. However, unresolved conflicts exist regarding the use of this area for recreation and
habitat protection for state endangered species. The Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District receives funding from
CDFG, State Bonds, California Division of Parks and Recreation, U.S. National Park Service Land and Water Grants,
and other sources, which have been used to stock the reservoir with fish, build duck blinds, a boat ramp, picnic facilities
and a fishing trail around the western portion of the reservoir between the dam and the dike. Projects that use state
money must comply with CEQA on each project or funding can be withdrawn. Impacts to

 occur during implementation of these projects and may continue to occur as a result of maintenance and use of these
facilities. The Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District, acting as the state lead agency, has issued negative declarations
for its improvement and maintenance activities, which exempts them from the requirement for a full environmental
analysis. Other signatory state agencies have not monitored CEQA compliance by the Cuyamaca Recreation and Park
District (Jack Shu, California State Parks Department, pers. comm., 1993). These factors have resulted in removal
of plants and habitat loss as discussed in factor A above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While CEQA pertains to projects on non-Federal land, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321
to 4347) requires disclosure of the environmental effects of projects within Federal jurisdiction. Species that
are listed by the State, but not proposed or listed as threatened or endangered by the Federal government, are not protected
when a proposed Federal action meets the criterion for a ``categorical exclusion''. NEPA requires that each of the
project alternatives recommend ways to ``protect, restore and enhance the environment'' and ``avoid and minimize
any possible adverse effects'' when implementation poses significant adverse impacts. However, it does not require
that the lead agency select an alternative with the least significant impacts to the environment (40 CFR 1500 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Federal actions that may affect Federal threatened or endangered species require consultation with the Fish and
Wildlife Service under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act and must avoid jeopardizing the continued existence
of a listed plant species and destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District is also subject to NEPA because projects for recreational improvements
may be funded through the Federal Land and Water Grant program that is administered by the National Park Service through
the California Department of Parks and Recreation. These projects would require NEPA review. Land-use planning
decisions at the local level are made on the basis of environmental review documents prepared in accordance with CEQA
or NEPA that often do not adequately address ``cumulative'' impacts to non-listed species and their habitat. State
listed species that are candidates for Federal listing receive no special consideration under NEPA.

Section 1603 of the California Fish and Game Code authorizes the Department of Fish and Game to regulate streambed
alteration. The Department must be notified and approve any work that diverts, alters, or obstructs the natural flow
or changes the bed, channel, or banks of any river, stream, or lake. If the Department does not respond within 30 days
of the notification, the applicant may proceed with the work. All waterways of the State, including streams, intermittent
streams, rivers, and lakes are subject to the Department's jurisdiction. However, the Department of Fish and Game
does not consider the creation of wetlands for duck habitat to be regulated under section 1603. Thus, a Streambed Alteration
Agreement was not required for flooding the streambed above Cuyamaca Lake reservoir for that purpose. Because the
dam has been used continuously since its construction in 1886, justification of its continued use for recreation
has been grandfathered into law (William D. Smith, Lake Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District,

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act authorizes the Army Corps of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though some of the areas surrounding Cuyamaca Lake reservoir 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are wetlands, water management activities are not regulated under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and these activities have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential to adversely affect the two taxa under consideration in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule. Several small water impoundments in streams around 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cuyamaca Lake reservoir may qualify for authorization under Nationwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permit (NWP) No. 26 of the Clean Water Act if they are less than one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acre (0.4 ha) in size. Because projects affecting such streams or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wetlands may proceed without notifying the Corps, evaluation of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts under section 404 is precluded. An individual permit may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the Corps if projects otherwise qualifying under NWP 26 are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to have significant environmental impacts. However, the Corps is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally reluctant to withhold authorization under NWP 26 unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence of a Federally listed species is likely to be jeopardized or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the action impacts a vernal pool (Bruce Henderson, Army Corps of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engineers, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act regulates clearing of

vegetation by mechanical means (e.g., bulldozing) but does not currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulate any method of clearing that does not disturb the soil or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vegetation from Cuyamaca Lake reservoir is not regulated under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
404, although water quality certification must be obtained from the

No federally listed species inhabit vernally wet meadows in the

National Forest has policies to protect sensitive plant taxa under its

adjustments to acquire and protect sensitive plant habitat, conserving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meadow water tables, and protecting montane meadow habitats (Winter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, implementation of plans to supply an equestrian campground with

water from a well at Filaree Flat in the Laguna Mountains may alter

 by virtue of their small population size and restricted distribution. The likelihood of finding a normal distribution
of genetic variability is reduced in small populations (Jensen 1987). Reduced genetic variability may lower the
ability of these populations to survive. The potential for local extirpation due to small population size can be exacerbated
by environmental conditions such as drought, flooding, or fire (Gilpin and Soule 1986, Falk and Holsinger 1991).

 in the National Forest and private land holdings. As discussed under factor D above, several measures were initiated
during the past decade to protect the vernally wet meadow ecosystem and associated sensitive plant species at Cuyamaca
State Park and the Cleveland National Forest. However, these measures have not prevented trampling by hikers and
horses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Introduced species of grasses and forbs have invaded many of California's plant communities. Such weedy species
can displace the native flora by out competing them for nutrients, water, light, and space. Weedy plant invasions
are facilitated by disturbances such as grazing, urban and residential developments, and various recreational
activities. Introduced weeds have become established in many portions of the Laguna Mountains thereby reducing
the amount of suitable habitat for native plant species (Sproul 1979). For example, the invasion of exotic species
including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lolium perenne
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (ryegrass) and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa pratensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Kentucky bluegrass) has altered the composition of habitats supporting the two plant taxa under consideration
in this proposed rule (Sproul 1979). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trampling by livestock typically changes the composition of native plant communities by reducing or eliminating
those species that cannot withstand trampling and predation (see Factors A and C), and enabling more resistant (usually
exotic) species to increase in abundance. Introduction of seed from non-sterile hay and animal feces increases the
likelihood of invasion of exotic species and prevents re-establishment of native plants. Taxa that were not previously
part of the native flora may be introduced and flourish under a grazing regime and may reduce or eliminate native plant
species through competition for resources. Grazing is considered to be a threat to all populations of

sensitive plant habitats (Winter 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 is in imminent danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range due to habitat destruction
and degradation resulting from hydrologic alterations, grazing, trampling by recreational activities, the inadequacy
of existing regulatory mechanisms, an increased probability of stochastic extinction, and competition from exotic
plant species. The Service considered threatened status for this species, but determined that it such status would
not be in keeping with the purposes of the Act because the single remaining population consists of only 8 to 23 stands
within a restricted range, and is at risk of extirpation due to stochastic events such as water inundation. Therefore,
the preferred action is to list

Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
propose designation of critical habitat at the time a species is proposed for listing as endangered or threatened.
Section 4(b)(6)(C) further indicates that a concurrent critical habitat designation is not required if the Service
finds that a prompt determination of endangered or threatened status is essential to the conservation of the involved
species, or that critical habitat is not then determinable. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat

 that would not likely be imperiled by the threat of vandalism, collecting, or other human activities. Section 7(a)(2)
of the Act requires Federal agencies to insure that their actions are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical

 on National Forest land would receive this added benefit from critical habitat designation. On non-federal land,
additional protection may be provided as a result of the increased public awareness afforded by the critical habitat
designation. In addition, the designation of critical habitat could be useful for State landowners and local regulatory
agencies to identify areas of special concern and to establish priorities for land management and acquisition. Designation
of critical habitat would be likely to result in more attention and hence protection by the State and county agencies
(J. Shu, pers. comm., 1994).

Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to consider economic and other impacts of designating a particular
area as critical habitat. The Service must evaluate the effects of activities that occur within the ranges of these
plants, and gather data on precise habitat requirements and ownership boundaries in order to precisely define the
critical habitat of these two plant taxa. In addition, the Service must analyze the economics impacts that could result
from the designation of particular areas as critical habitat. Designation of critical habitat for

a prompt determination of endangered or threatened status for these species is essential to ensure the full benefits
of conservation measures under the Act. The Service intends to propose a critical habitat designation at a later date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition
through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,
and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that
recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.

, all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61 or 17.71, would apply. These prohibitions,
in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export, transport
in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale any such species in
interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce to possession any such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plant species are exempt from these prohibitions provided that a statement
of ``cultivated origin'' appears on their containers. In addition, for listed plants, the 1988 amendments (Pub.
L. 100&hyph;478) to the Act prohibit the malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands and the removal, cutting,
digging up, or damaging or destroying of listed plants in knowing violation of any State law or regulation, including
State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.
The Act and 50 CFR 17.62, 17.63, and 17.72 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited
activities involving endangered or threatened species under certain circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered or threatened plants under
certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63. Such permits are available
for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species. Trade permits will not likely be sought
or issued for any of the plant species considered herein because they are not in cultivation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regarding them should be addressed to the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon, 97232&hyph;4181 (telephone

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is asking for public comment about whether and how the agency should develop
regulations that would establish requirements for a new comprehensive food safety assurance program for both domestically
produced and imported foods. Such regulations, if promulgated, would enhance FDA's ability to ensure the safety
of the U.S. food supply. In this document, FDA is proposing that this program be based upon the principles of Hazard
Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP). FDA is requesting comments on a number of specific issues, as well as on
all aspects of such a food safety program.

A. Status of the Food Safety Assurance Program in the United States
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FDA's mandate to ensure the safety of the nation's food supply is derived principally from the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Under the act, FDA has authority to ensure that all foods in interstate commerce, or that have been shipped in interstate
commerce, are not contaminated or otherwise adulterated, are produced under sanitary conditions, and are not misbranded
or deceptively packaged
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
. The agency also has authority to ensure food safety under the Public Health Service Act (the PHS act) (42 U.S.C. 264),
which relates to the control of the spread of communicable diseases from one State, territory, or possession to another,
or from outside the United States into this country.

Two other Federal agencies share with FDA the responsibility for regulating the safety of the food supply. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) has authority under the Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601), the Poultry Inspection
Act (21 U.S.C. 451), and the Egg Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 1031) to inspect facilities in which meat, poultry,
and eggs, respectively, are processed, and to regulate such products. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
has authority, under provisions of the act, to establish legal limits (tolerances) for residues of pesticides on
foods. FDA and USDA enforce such tolerances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To carry out its mandate to ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply, FDA conducts periodic inspections of food processors,
shippers, food packers and repackers, food labelers and relabelers, and food warehouses. Some inspections are carried
out by the States, under contract with FDA. In addition, although subject to FDA jurisdiction, the many hundreds of
thousands of retail food outlets and restaurants in the United States are inspected by State and local health departments
with technical assistance and training from FDA. FDA's program to ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply also includes
sample analyses of food offered for import, research into rapid detection methodologies for potential hazards,
enforcement activities, and education and information sharing programs. The goal of all of these regulatory and
enforcement activities is to ensure that the food supply is, and remains, safe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the current food safety assurance program has generally functioned effectively, it currently faces new
stresses and challenges. New food processing and packaging technologies, new food distribution and consumption
patterns, increasing public health concerns about low levels of certain chemical contaminants, and new microbial
pathogens all contribute to today's food safety challenge. For example, the composition of the food supply has changed
dramatically in the 55 years since passage of the act. More people consume commercially processed or commercially
prepared foods than ever before, and there is increased consumer demand for ``fresh'' foods in convenient, ready-to-cook
forms, which has fostered the development of sophisticated processing and packaging systems that can significantly
extend the shelf life of a variety of foods. However, new food safety risks can be associated with these new food products,
new packages, and new patterns of distribution and consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the most important challenges to FDA's current food safety assurance program is the increasing number of new
food pathogens. Although food borne illness has always been a public health problem, such illness appears to be on
the rise, and new pathogens are appearing (Ref. 1). In addition, because foods are more extensively processed and
handled, there is now a greater opportunity for food to be contaminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food borne illness is a major cause of morbidity in the United States; estimates of the yearly incidence of food borne
illness vary greatly, ranging from 6.5 million (Ref. 1) to 12.6 million cases per year (Ref. 2), and from 24 to 81 million
cases per year (Ref. 3). In the 15 years between 1973 and 1988, the number of recognized food borne pathogens broadened
considerably. During that period, bacteria not previously recognized as important food borne pathogens emerged,
including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and a variety of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vibrio
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp. During that same period, experts recognized that certain food borne illnesses may be followed by serious complications,
such as arthritis, kidney damage, heart disease, and neurological damage (Ref. 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pathogens are not the only potential contaminants of food, however. The extensive use of industrial chemicals, coupled
with past failures to deal adequately with chemical waste, have resulted in significant chemical pollution of the
environment in some regions. Many of these chemicals have found their way into the food chain. The legal use of pesticides
in agriculture may also result in residues in food. Naturally occurring chemicals, such as toxic elements and mycotoxins,
can also be found in food at levels of concern. The sheer number of these potential contaminants, the concerns about
their toxicity even at very low levels, and the difficulty and expense associated with many of the analytical methods
used to quantify their levels in food, make exhaustive endpoint monitoring of the food supply virtually impossible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The size and diversity of the food industry adds to the stress on the current food safety assurance program. FDA's current
inventory lists over 30,000 food manufacturers and processors, and in excess of 20,000 food warehouses. The number
of foreign manufacturers and processors shipping food products to the United States continues to increase. In 1992,
there were well over 1 million food import entries into the United States. In addition, the diversity of food imports
continues to increase, with a rising volume of foods entering the United States in processed forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the current food safety program is under stress internally. It is unlikely that FDA will ever have sufficient
resources to inspect, sample, and analyze more than a small percentage of imported food shipments. State and local
governments, on which FDA relies heavily for surveillance of the growing retail food sector, are also under severe
resource constraints. Indeed, some States are considering proposals to reduce their food safety programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's current regulatory strategy for ensuring food safety, with its emphasis on periodic visual inspection of food
facilities and end-product testing, was designed to control the problems that were known to exist when the act was
established in 1938. The agency has struggled to keep up with the enormous growth and changes in the food industry and
the resulting new food safety challenges. FDA's current regulatory approach is relatively resource intensive and
inefficient compared to other ways of ensuring food safety. Inspections that FDA conducts under the current system
can determine the adequacy of conditions in a food plant at the time of the inspection but not whether the company has
in place a food safety assurance program that is operating reliably and consistently to produce safe food at all times.
Furthermore, the current inspectional approach is generally reactive, not preventive. It is effective in detecting
and correcting problems after they occur, but, except in certain limited areas such as the regulation of infant formula
and low acid canned foods, it is not currently based on a system of preventive controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all of these reasons, FDA believes that it is appropriate at this time for the agency to consider improvements to
its food safety assurance program to focus the program on prevention of food safety risks and problems. FDA's goals
in establishing additional food safety regulations would be to: (1) Make the food supply safer through prevention
of food safety problems; (2) enable FDA and its State and local counterparts to make more efficient use of the existing
resources devoted to ensuring food safety, and (3) enhance the ability of the Federal Government to provide consumers
with the assurance they seek that the U.S. food supply is safe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that risks vary across the food supply and that measures to make food safer should focus on the potential
of particular foods or possible contaminants in those foods to cause illness. The agency also recognizes that there
is no proven method or approach for ensuring the safety of food that will eliminate risk in all circumstances. Indeed,
one purpose of this notice is to seek public comment on the degree of potential risks posed by those microorganisms,
chemicals, and physical hazards (e.g., broken glass) that can get into food and be passed on to the consumer, if appropriate
care is not exercised. FDA also desires comments on the consequences of these risks if they occur. In addition, the
agency seeks comment on how these risks can best be controlled and which systems of quality control can best protect
consumers from potentially unsafe food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the agency has reached no final conclusions about how its regulatory programs should be revised to make food
as safe as possible, FDA has tentatively concluded that the improvements in the agency's current food safety assurance
program should be based on a state-of-the-art, preventive approach known as HACCP. HACCP was developed approximately
30 years ago by the U.S. food industry, and it is currently used in a number of domestic food processing facilities.
HACCP is internationally regarded as the most effective system for producing safe food. FDA is considering HACCP
as the foundation for revision of the U.S. food safety assurance program because, although simple in its basic concepts,
HACCP is a sophisticated and powerful tool for ensuring food safety. HACCP is a science based, systematic approach
to preventing food safety problems by anticipating how such problems are most likely to occur and by installing effective
measures to prevent them from occurring. HACCP thus requires that the processor and the regulatory authority be aware
of the state-of-the-art science relative to food safety and processing technology. HACCP appropriately affirms
that the food industry has primary responsibility for producing safe food, and it provides an important opportunity
to link the food industry's system for producing safe food with the Government's system of regulatory oversight.
A more in-depth discussion of the HACCP concept follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. The HACCP System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HACCP concept (Ref. 4) is a systematic approach to the identification, assessment of risk (likelihood of occurrence
and severity), and control of the biological, chemical, and physical hazards associated with a particular food production
process or practice. HACCP is a preventive strategy. It is based on development by the food producer of a plan that anticipates
food safety hazards and identifies the points in the production process where a failure would likely result in a hazard
being created or allowed to persist; these points are referred to as critical control points (CCP's). Under HACCP,
identified CCP's are systematically monitored, and records kept of that monitoring. Corrective actions are taken
when control of a CCP is lost, including proper disposition of the food produced during that period, and these actions
are documented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of the HACCP system for the food industry will underscore the industry's role in continuous problem prevention
and problem solving, rather than relying solely on traditional facility inspections by regulatory agencies to detect
loss of control. HACCP provides for real time monitoring procedures to assess the effectiveness of control. Each
HACCP plan would reflect the uniqueness of a food, its method of processing, and the facility in which it is prepared.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP has been endorsed by the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF) as an effective
and rational means of ensuring food safety from harvest to table. The NACMCF was established in 1988 by USDA in conjunction
with FDA to fulfill a recommendation of the National Academy of Sciences, and includes officials from FDA, USDA, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Defense, as well as experts from academia
and the food industry. HACCP is also recognized in the international food safety community as the state-of-the-art
means to ensure the safety and integrity of food. In particular, the Committee on Food Hygiene of the United Nations'
Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) has endorsed the HACCP concept as a world wide guideline. Indeed, the European
Union (EU) and other countries around the world have begun to require that foods produced within their borders be processed
under HACCP requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NACMCF has developed the following seven principles that describe the HACCP concept:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Hazard Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first step in the establishment of a HACCP system for a food process or practice is the identification of the hazards
associated with the product. The NACMCF defines a hazard as a biological, chemical, or physical property that may
cause a food to be unsafe for consumption. The hazard analysis step should include an assessment of both the likelihood
that such a hazard will occur and its severity if it does occur. This analysis should also involve the establishment
of preventive measures to control identified hazards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Identification of CCP's
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A CCP is a point, step, or procedure at which control can be applied, the result being that a potential food safety hazard
can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels. Points in the manufacturing process that may be CCP's
include cooking, chilling, specific sanitation procedures, product formulation control, prevention of cross
contamination, and certain aspects of employee and environmental hygiene.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Establishment of Critical Limits for Preventive Measures Associated With Each Identified CCP
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This step involves establishing a criterion that must be met for each preventive measure associated with a CCP. Critical
limits can be thought of as boundaries of safety for each CCP and may be set for preventive measures such as temperature,
time, physical dimensions, moisture level, water activity, pH, and available chlorine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Establishment of Procedures to Monitor CCP's
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Monitoring is a planned sequence of observations or measurements to assess whether a CCP is under control and to produce
an accurate record for use in future verification procedures. Continuous monitoring is possible with many types
of physical and chemical methods. When it is not possible to monitor a critical limit on a continuous basis, monitoring
intervals must be frequent enough to permit the manufacturer to determine whether the step/process/procedure designed
to control the hazard is under control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Establishment of Corrective Actions To Be Taken When Monitoring Shows That a Critical Limit Has Been Exceeded
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the HACCP system is intended to prevent deviations in a planned process from occurring, total prevention can
rarely, if ever, be achieved. Therefore, there must be a corrective action plan in place to ensure appropriate disposition
of any food produced during a deviation, to fix or correct the cause of noncompliance to ensure that the CCP is once again
under control, and to maintain records of corrective actions taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Establishment of Effective Recordkeeping Systems That Document the HACCP System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This principle requires the preparation and maintenance of a written HACCP plan that lists the hazards, CCP's, and
critical limits identified by the firm, as well as the monitoring, recordkeeping, and other procedures that the firm
intends to use to implement the plan. This principle also requires the maintenance of records generated during the
operation of the plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Establishment of Procedures to Verify That the HACCP System is Working
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This process involves verifying that the critical limits are adequate to control the hazards identified, ensuring
that the HACCP plan is working properly and verifying that there is documented, periodic revalidation of the plan
to confirm that the plan is still performing its intended function under existing plant conditions at any point in
time.

C. FDA's Authority to Mandate HACCP
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4142), FDA proposed regulations that would require HACCP controls in the seafood industry.
The agency believes that it is now appropriate to explore the application of HACCP to segments of the industry other
than seafood. At this time the agency would plan to proceed in a stepwise fashion with those segments of the industry
that are suitable candidates for adoption of HACCP principles. This document is intended to explore how the agency
should pursue that broader HACCP program. FDA is doing so because the agency believes that such a program would be an
effective and efficient way to ensure that food meets the act's safety standards and to implement section 402(a)(4)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(4)). As explained below, if FDA proceeds with a HACCP proposal covering additional segments
of the food industry, such proposal would be made pursuant to the authority of sections 402 and 701(a) of the act (21
U.S.C. 371(a)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 201 of the act defines the term ``food'' as ``articles used for food or drink for man or other animals.'' Under
section 402(a)(4) of the act, a food is deemed adulterated if it has been ``prepared, packed, or held under insanitary
conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.''
Proof that a food is actually contaminated or otherwise hazardous is not required to establish that a food is adulterated
under section 402(a)(4) of the act. (See

, 502 F.2d 700, 704 (7th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 422 U.S. 1007 (1975).) Instead, such adulteration requires only
a showing that the conditions under which food is prepared, packed, or held create a ``reasonable possibility'' of
contamination. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

United States
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 200 F.2d 818, 821 (8th Cir. 1952).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its enforcement of section 402(a)(4) of the act, FDA has considered, among other things, prevailing industry standards
and the technical state-of-the-art in determining, on a case-by-case basis, whether the conditions under which
a company is processing or otherwise handling food violate the standard of section 402 (a)(4). FDA's current intention
is to propose to codify, in a future rulemaking, a state-of-the-art standard based upon HACCP principles. This standard
would establish those conditions of food manufacturing, packing, and holding that are consistent with section 402(a)(4)
of the act. Such regulations would thus ensure the agency's efficient enforcement of section 402(a)(4) and the other
food safety provisions of the act, as authorized by section 701(a) of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this juncture, the regulations that FDA is considering for proposal would specify the requirements that the agency
believes are the minimum necessary to ensure that food products under FDA's jurisdiction are not adulterated under
section 402(a)(4) of the act. Under the program that FDA is considering, if a food purveyor covered by the program does
not adopt and implement a HACCP plan that complies with the program's requirements or does not operate the plan in accordance
with the program, food prepared, packed, or held in that facility would be adulterated under section 402(a) (4) of
the act and potentially subject to regulatory action by FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Rationale for a HACCP Approach
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA expects that adoption of HACCP by some or all segments of the food industry, coupled with Government verification
through inspections of the HACCP system, will more effectively and efficiently ensure the safety of the American
food supply. The agency has tentatively chosen a HACCP approach because HACCP addresses the root causes of food safety
problems in production, storage, transportation, etc., and is preventive. Two principal alternatives to HACCP
exist; end-product testing and comprehensive current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations. End-product
testing does not address the root causes of food safety problems; it is not preventive by design and requires that a
large number of samples be analyzed to ensure product integrity. Similarly, CGMP's are not a practical approach because
of the breadth and diversity of the food industry, the limited resources available within FDA to prepare the many specific
CGMP regulations that would be needed to cover effectively such a diverse industry, and the time required to implement
such regulations. However, FDA may consider the promulgation of CGMP's for certain food processes or types if such
regulations would be more effective than a HACCP system for such processes. For example, some of the comments have
suggested that sanitation would be better addressed through CGMP's than through a HACCP plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A HACCP system for food safety assurance has numerous distinct advantages including the following: (1) HACCP focuses
on prevention and is designed to prevent hazards from entering food; (2) HACCP permits more effective and efficient
Government oversight; (3) HACCP places primary responsibility for ensuring food safety appropriately on the food
manufacturer/distributor; and (4) HACCP assists food companies in competing more effectively in the world market.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary purpose of any HACCP system is to prevent problems through the systematic analysis and control of the production
system by industry. This analysis and control would be confirmed by Government verification of the industry's monitoring.
As such, a HACCP approach provides an appropriate balance between the responsibilities of industry and Government
in ensuring food safety. A HACCP based program will also allow FDA and its State and local government counterparts
to conduct more efficient and focused inspections of food facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to being preventive in nature and more efficient, a HACCP approach offers two additional benefits over
conventional inspection techniques. First, in contrast to FDA's current regulatory approach, a HACCP approach
requires industry to analyze, in a rational, scientific manner, its production processes in order to identify CCP's
and to establish critical limits and monitoring procedures. An essential part of the industry's role under HACCP
is to establish and maintain records to document adherence to the critical limits relating to the identified CCP's,
which will result in continuous self inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, HACCP allows the regulator to monitor more effectively a firm's compliance with food safety laws. With its
current system of inspection, FDA can determine the conditions at a food plant only during the period of inspection.
The agency must therefore make assumptions about conditions before and after the inspection based on a snapshot of
plant conditions and practices at the time of the inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With an HACCP-based program in place, an investigator can determine and evaluate both current and past conditions
critical to ensuring the safety of food produced by the facility. As discussed above, an essential part of a HACCP system
is maintenance of monitoring records. By examining such records, the Government inspector can, in effect, look back
through time at the conditions of a facility. Under the proposal that FDA currently envisions, the agency would have
access to CCP monitoring records to verify that the HACCP plan is working. Government monitoring under a HACCP system
would provide assurance that systems of preventive controls are in place and functioning properly and thus afford
greater public assurance of food safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current Federal inspection and surveillance strategies attempt to gauge the industry's knowledge of hazards and
preventive control measures largely by inference, i.e., whether a company's products are in fact adulterated, or
whether conditions in a plant are in compliance with CGMP's. Consequently, the current inspection system places
a great deal of responsibility on Government regulators to uncover problems and to take regulatory action to address
those problems. Under a HACCP-based inspection system, it would be the responsibility of the company to develop a
plan for producing safe food, and the role of Government inspectors would be to verify that the company is carrying
out its plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, adopting a HACCP system could potentially enhance international trade opportunities for the United States.
Although enhancing trade has no direct effect on public health, participation in international trade in food products
is critical to the U.S. economy. The United States is by far the world's major food exporter, with exports of raw agricultural
and processed food products of over $40 billion per year. The United States also imports a substantial quantity of
food products each year from many countries around the world. HACCP will improve FDA's ability to monitor such imports
and thus ensure confidence in their safety. Also, HACCP is becoming the world-wide standard to ensure the safety of
food and will thus serve as basis for harmonizing U.S. food safety regulations with those of other nations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Uruguay Round negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has resulted in further focus
on this area. The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures states the desire of member
countries, including the United States, to further ``* * * the use of harmonized sanitary and phytosanitary measures
between members, on the basis of international standards, guidelines and recommendations developed by the relevant
international organizations, including the Codex Alimentarius Commission * * *'' (Ref. 5). This trend toward harmonization,
coupled with the current recommendations of the Codex Alimentarius Commission encouraging the international use
of HACCP, provide further support for FDA's serious consideration of a HACCP program for all or part of the food industry.

E. How the Agency Intends to Proceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA began its initiative to mandate HACCP with a proposal covering the seafood industry due in large part to the fact
that a substantial amount of work on the application of HACCP to seafood processing and importation, including the
development of specific HACCP models, has already been done by the Federal Government, some States, academia, and
by the seafood industry itself. Thus, there is a considerable body of literature and expertise, which can facilitate
the development of HACCP systems by seafood processors and importers. Moreover, seafood industry representatives
have been urging the Federal Government to adopt a mandatory HACCP program. The National Fisheries Institute, the
largest seafood industry trade association, has testified repeatedly at congressional hearings in support of legislation
that would mandate such a system. The agency recommends that interested persons refer to the seafood proposal to understand
how the HACCP approach might work with respect to one category of food product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The body of knowledge and experience on the application of HACCP to food production has not, as far as the agency is aware,
been developed for other commodities to the extent that it has for seafood. (One possible exception is the low acid
canned food industry, where much work has been done in HACCP's application due to FDA's long standing regulatory program
for this industry.) Moreover, the food industry is extremely diverse and complex. For these reasons, FDA has decided
to issue this advance notice of proposed rulemaking to request comments on various aspects of the implementation
of a mandatory HACCP program for some or all other sectors of the food industry. Those comments may suggest that an industry-wide
HACCP requirement is appropriate or may indicate that such a program should be phased-in as data on individual commodities
is compiled. FDA is open to any other suggestions. Specific issues on which FDA is particularly interested in receiving
comments are set out below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that it could benefit from experience with the application of HACCP to selected commodities outside
the seafood area. To gain this experience the agency has announced a voluntary pilot HACCP program and invited interested
food producers to participate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the objectives of this pilot program are to obtain data on the hazards associated with particular types of food,
and to develop and implement HACCP plans to control those hazards in conjunction with the participating firms. The
pilot program could provide the agency and the industry with the practical knowledge and experience that would assist
in the development and implementation of a HACCP program for particular segments of the food industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that an ongoing exchange of scientific, technical, and operational information between the agency,
the food industry, trade associations, consumer groups, FDA's State and local counterparts, and other affected
parties is essential for the successful implementation of HACCP in the food industry. Consequently, FDA intends
to maintain a dialogue with all affected parties during the process of developing its proposed regulations. In particular,
FDA will meet with the food industry, consumer groups, and other interested parties during the comment period on this
advance notice of proposed rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA anticipates that it will receive a substantial number of comments in response to this document. The agency will
review these comments and have further dialogue with industry and consumer representatives, as well as other groups
and organizations knowledgeable in food safety, as part of its process for determining the appropriate regulatory
approach prior to publication of a proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA intends to work closely with USDA, as it considers development of its own HACCP regulations for meat and poultry
products, to ensure that the two regulatory bodies have a consistent approach in applying HACCP principles to the
food industry, while recognizing that inherent differences may exist between food commodity groups that will necessitate
different approaches.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also intends to work closely with its State and local counterparts that regulate the retail segment of the food
industry. One principal way FDA conveys its recommended food regulatory policy to the nation's State and local food
control agencies is through FDA's model Food Code. A notice of availability of the latest revision of the Food Code,
which incorporates certain HACCP principles and terminology, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

II. Request for Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the act, the food industry has the primary responsibility for ensuring the safety of the food it produces and
distributes. In its simplest terms, the role of Government is to verify that the industry is carrying out its responsibility
and to initiate regulatory or other appropriate action when the industry fails to do so. FDA believes that establishing
a HACCP program throughout the food industry could enable both the industry and FDA to carry out their respective responsibilities
far more efficiently and effectively. FDA invites comments on this point, as well as on specific issues relating to
the application of HACCP to foods other than seafood, as set out below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Scope of a HACCP Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NACMCF supports the adoption of HACCP throughout the food industry ((Ref. 4). Additionally, the Codex Ailmentarius
Committee on Food Hygiene considers HACCP to be the most efficient and cost effective means to manage food safety (Ref.
4). FDA recognizes, however, that not all foods pose the same inherent risks. The agency intends to work with the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention and other Federal and State agencies as well as health professionals, industry,
and consumer groups to access and evaluate data on the relative risks associated with various foods. FDA has concluded
that HACCP has great potential to improve food safety and can be successfully used beyond seafood. However, specific
HACCP requirements established for the various segments of the industry may be different because of differences
in risk as well as differences in processes, etc. The agency encourages the food industry generally to begin using
HACCP more widely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA specifically requests comments on the scope of any mandatory HACCP program proposed by the agency. Should FDA
mandate HACCP for all segments of the food industry? Or should HACCP be required only for certain segments of the food
industry? In deciding whether to cover all or some segments of the food industry by a mandatory HACCP rule, what criteria
should FDA use? In particular, should any exclusions from a HACCP requirement be determined on any basis other than
the risk presented by the particular activity? Are there categories of activities, such as the warehousing of certain
types of foodstuffs, that deserve exclusion?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also requests comment on how a mandatory HACCP rule should apply to those in the chain of distribution of
imported foods. How should the agency ensure that imported foods are produced and handled safely? In the seafood proposal,
FDA is proposing that all domestic and foreign processors and importers adopt HACCP controls, and FDA is proposing
to take steps to ensure that the HACCP controls are in fact implemented by foreign processors. The seafood proposal
broadly defines ``processor'' to include packers, repackers, wholesalers, and warehousers. Should the agency
adopt the same approach with respect to foreign processors, handlers, and importers of all other foods? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also solicits comments on whether and how a mandatory HACCP rule should apply to food retailers. The agency's seafood
proposal specifically excludes retailers from the definition of ``processor.'' Should a similar exclusion be made
for retailers of all other foods as well? The agency notes that its updated Food Code, which serves as guidance to the
States as part of an ongoing cooperative program for regulating the retail sector, incorporates several HACCP elements.
The agency requests comment on this cooperative program for the retail sector and on how governments at all levels
can best collaborate to ensure the safety of food from farm or fishery to the dinner table, including food sold ready-to-eat
at the retail level. Should HACCP be required in restaurants and other retail outlets? Should HACCP requirements
be applied directly to raw material suppliers and transportation companies? Or should such requirements be imposed
indirectly through the HACCP plans of processors and others who receive food (e.g., by using purchase specifications)?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also specifically requests comment on how small firms should be covered by any mandatory HACCP regulations. In
the seafood proposal, FDA has made no distinctions in the application of proposed requirements based on firm size.
If small firms should be exempt, on what basis should the exemption be made? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Focus of HACCP
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NACMCF believes that HACCP and HACCP plans should address food safety, including all biological, chemical, and physical
hazards that would affect a particular food. Consistent with this view, FDA has limited the scope of the HACCP requirements
in the seafood proposal to safety concerns and has not included food quality and labeling standards and requirements.
Although the agency believes that the primary focus of a HACCP program should be safety, FDA is aware that food quality
is also important to consumers and is an issue in international trade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should FDA's HACCP program for the broader food industry be limited to food safety and the hazards presented by a particular
activity? If so, how broadly should hazard be defined? What level of risk warrants HACCP-type control? Should different
levels of control be required in HACCP plans for different levels of risk? Or should FDA's proposal mandate that food
quality issues be included in HACCP plans? Should sanitation practices within the plant be required to be included
in HACCP plans?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Implementation of HACCP
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA recognizes that, because of the size and diversity of the overall food industry, any mandatory HACCP program would
likely be costly for some segments of the food industry and need to be phased in gradually. Development of HACCP plans
would require at least some segments of the industry to adopt new ways of thinking and operating. Review by FDA of HACCP
plans and monitoring records as part of its plant inspections would necessitate additional training of FDA, State,
and local investigators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the scope of the task, what would be a reasonable time period for the implementation of HACCP? In the seafood
proposal, FDA is proposing a 1-year period for implementation, measured from the date of the final regulations. This
proposed lead time takes into account the fact that a considerable amount of developmental work has already been done
on the application of HACCP to seafood processing. Are there special considerations for other types of foods that
could affect implementation time? Are there circumstances that would require some industry segments to need an implementation
period longer than 1 year after final rule promulgation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If implementation of HACCP is to be phased in (i.e., certain segments would gradually be subject to the HACCP requirements
established), how should this be accomplished? How should firms or segments of the food industry be differentiated
for purposes of such a phased in implementation? What would be appropriate time intervals between each implementation
phase? What criteria should be used to decide the order of implementation for the various segments of the food industry?
For example, should potential food safety risks associated with the product be considered in determining an implementation
schedule, and if so, what factors should be used in ranking foods with respect to potential risk? Likewise, for example,
should firm size be considered in determining the order of implementation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is interested in learning about the experiences that food manufacturers have had with the implementation
of HACCP and therefore requests comments from firms who have had actual experience in the application of HACCP concepts
to food production, both on what has worked and on what has not worked. In particular, FDA seeks information on: (1)
How long it took to implement a HACCP program; (2) the start-up and maintenance costs; and (3) the impact of implementing
HACCP on the safety of the product, the efficiency of the firm's operation, and any long-term savings (cost effectiveness).
The agency is also interested in any measures that have been, or could be, used to measure the effectiveness of HACCP
to improve product safety. The agency is particularly interested in the experiences of small food firms on all of the
above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA believes that implementation of HACCP beyond the seafood industry, whether voluntary or mandatory, will more
effectively and efficiently ensure the safety of the American food supply. The agency recognizes, however, that
there may be alternatives to the HACCP approach and invites comment on such alternatives and their effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also invites comment on whether there are factors that would limit the effectiveness of the HACCP approach.
What information is needed in order to judge the effectiveness of a HACCP program? Should HACCP programs be pilot tested
before implementation? Should there be a minimum level of certainty that a HACCP plan would be effective in controlling
hazards prior to implementation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What should be the qualifications of individuals responsible for developing HACCP plans? What should be the qualifications
of individuals responsible for verification of HACCP plans? Is the current state of knowledge sufficient to make
adequate hazard analyses? Is there a need for microbiological criteria in HACCP plans? Will end-product microbiological
testing be necessary?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How should the appropriate frequency of monitoring CCP's be determined? Should a processing plant be required to
submit a report to FDA each time a process is found to be out of control? What, if any, circumstances should trigger mandatory
reporting to FDA? Is it necessary to require that a food processor have a reliable and well-tested method of recall
as part of its HACCP plan?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Roles of FDA, the States, and the Food Industry
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's interest in institutionalizing HACCP for the food industry is based on the agency's recognition of the need
to revise the current regulatory approach and make it more effective and comprehensive. This revision must coordinate
and maximize the efforts of all levels of Government and the food industry to provide effective coverage of food from
farm or fishery to table. The respective roles of industry, State and local authorities, and FDA must be clearly articulated,
and they must be integrated and coordinated. FDA's preliminary thinking on the nature of these respective roles follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If FDA decides to make HACCP mandatory for some or all segments of the food industry, firms would be required to develop,
implement, and maintain an effective HACCP system in their facility, and to verify that the system is adequate to ensure
a safe product. The HACCP system developed by the firm would have to include all relevant critical limits (such as tolerances)
contained in existing FDA regulations and guidelines, as well as other CCP's judged necessary by the firm to ensure
the safety of the food. Firms would also be responsible for taking appropriate corrective actions whenever a CCP deviation
has occurred. The system would be considered out of compliance when a critical limit of a CCP has been exceeded and corrective
actions are not taken or are ineffective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulated industry segments would also be responsible for providing appropriate training for personnel involved
in implementing HACCP in each facility. Each facility would have to maintain an accurate, up-to-date HACCP plan,
which would be available for review by FDA investigators during an inspection. Records pertinent to the monitoring
of the CCP's in the HACCP plan would also have to be available for review by FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is seeking comment on the appropriateness of imposing these obligations on the food industry under a mandatory
HACCP system. The agency is especially interested in receiving comments on records access, including: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) What records should be considered HACCP records, and therefore be accessible to FDA (and State and local) investigators?
Under FDA's proposed HACCP regulations for seafood, HACCP records include the HACCP plan itself, records of the monitoring
of critical control points, and records of corrective actions. In the case of seafood, FDA tentatively concluded
that the agency should have access to all records deemed to be HACCP records, because without such access, the regulatory
requirements would not be meaningful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) How should consumer complaint files relating to CCP failures be utilized in a HACCP system? In FDA's proposed HACCP
regulations for seafood, the agency tentatively concluded that each HACCP system should take advantage of consumer
complaints as they relate to the operation of CCP's. The agency proposed that procedures for monitoring CCP's include
procedures for monitoring relevant consumer complaints, and that consumer complaints that potentially relate
to the performance of critical control points be considered HACCP records. FDA invites comment on this approach for
foods generally. Should FDA have access to consumer complaint files relating to CCP failures? What criteria should
be used to determine whether a consumer complaint is linked to a CCP failure? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) How long should HACCP records be kept? The proposed HACCP regulations for seafood mandate 1 year for fresh products
and 2 years for frozen and preserved products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an additional matter, FDA is aware that there is substantial public interest in the extent to which industry-generated
HACCP records could or should be publicly available. FDA invites comment on the general question of public disclosure
of HACCP records and on the agency's preliminary analysis of the availability of such records, which follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has long had explicit statutory authority to obtain access to certain industry records during inspections involving
infant formula, drugs, and devices (21 U.S.C. 374), and has had access by virtue of agency regulations to certain processing
records during inspections of low acid canned food processors and manufacturers of infant formula. The agency has
the right to copy and take possession of these records, but does not routinely do so. FDA typically copies and takes
possession of records only when they may be needed for regulatory purposes. As a preliminary matter, FDA expects to
continue this practice with regard to HACCP records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public availability of those HACCP documents that would become part of FDA's official records as a result of copying
during an inspection would be governed by section 301(j) of the act and by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and
regulations issued under the FOIA by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and by FDA. Section 301(j) of
the act expressly prohibits any person from disclosing trade secret information obtained during the course of an
inspection. The agency's FOIA regulations also state that FDA will not disclose either trade secret or confidential
commercial information. FDA's preliminary view is that HACCP plans and monitoring records fall within these two
categories of protected records. As a consequence, FDA may have little discretion to disclose such records. Moreover,
under HHS FOIA regulations, processors may be entitled to challenge in court a pending disclosure of records on the
ground that the records to be disclosed are confidential commercial or trade secret. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, there are significant legal and practical questions as to whether FDA has the authority to require
disclosure of industry records that are not in FDA's possession. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency is also seeking comments on whether there should be a standardized format (structure and organization)
for written HACCP plans. If so, how should this standard format be developed and who should develop it?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is the case today, the overall goal of FDA's inspection program would be to ensure that foods are safely prepared,
packed, and held. To achieve this goal under a HACCP system, FDA's inspection would seek to verify that a HACCP plan
is adequate to ensure food safety and that it is being implemented and maintained properly. The agency is seeking comments
on the appropriate frequency of agency inspections under a mandatory HACCP program to achieve its goal of ensuring
food safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is also interested in receiving comments on the possible role that FDA could play to assist the food industry
in developing and establishing HACCP programs. This assistance could take the form of agency guidelines for developing
HACCP plans and generic HACCP plans developed in cooperation with the industry. FDA could also promote and participate
in educational programs to encourage the use of HACCP and FDA could continue to represent the United States at international
meetings on HACCP. The agency could work with interested groups to identify new food safety hazards and to develop
new strategies for their control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency expects that the States would play a major role in enhancing FDA's enforcement coverage. State authorities
could participate in HACCP inspections both as part of their own enforcement activities and under FDA contract. State
and local authorities could also be involved in actively promoting the use of HACCP at the retail level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is seeking comments on what its role should be relative to the review, verification, monitoring, and certification
of HACCP plans. In the seafood proposal, FDA is not proposing to require that HACCP plans be submitted to FDA in advance,
or that preapproval by FDA be a condition of the adoption or implementation of these plans. If FDA proposes to make HACCP
mandatory for other portions of the food industry, should it adopt this approach? Should FDA indentify CCP's and establish
critical limits in its HACCP regulation, or should it defer to firms to develop these themselves? What role should
FDA serve in overseeing the corrective actions taken when a deviation has occurred? Can any HACCP oversight function,
including review of plans and monitoring, be performed by certified third parties? If so, how should they be certified
and by whom?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For implementation of HACCP for fish and fishery products, FDA is developing guidelines for processors. These guidelines
inventory and describe the likely hazards associated with both products and processes, and provide advice on how
these hazards can be controlled. These guidelines also include a fill-in-the-blank HACCP plan to serve as an example
of how a basic HACCP plan could be developed. Are such guidelines necessary for other commodities and, if so, who should
develop them? What specifically should be included? What role should the food industry play in the development of
these materials? What other forms of assistance should FDA provide? To what extent, if any, should any of this additional
guidance be made mandatory?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Training and Education
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency's experience with low acid canned foods established that appropriate training is critical to the successful
implementation of HACCP in the food industry. The industry will need training on how to develop HACCP plans, i.e.,
how to identify hazards and establish critical limits, control measures, corrective actions, and recordkeeping
procedures. Investigators employed by regulatory agencies, including FDA, will need training to understand how
to review HACCP plans as well as industry records pertaining to implementation and operation of such plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon its low acid canned food experience, FDA believes that employee training is an essential element of an effective
HACCP program. Should FDA mandate training for plant personnel responsible for developing and maintaining the HACCP
program? In the seafood proposal, FDA is proposing to require that each processor and importer employ at least one
individual who has successfully completed a training course on the application of HACCP to fish and fishery products
processing. Moreover, the regulations propose to require that those at each establishment who have received training
be responsible for reviewing records of CCP monitoring, recognizing critical limit deficiencies, and assessing
the need for corrective actions relative to the product in question and the HACCP plan itself. FDA seeks comment on
the question of training. Are there reasons why such training should not be mandated? If such training is required,
as FDA currently believes it should be, who should conduct these training courses? Who should be required to attend?
What role, if any, should FDA have regarding course materials and instructors? Should a third party be certified by
FDA to review and approve the training courses? Should one, some, or all responsible plant employees be certified?

G. International Harmonization
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the international community moves toward HACCP, FDA believes an opportunity exists to improve the safety of the
U.S. food supply by working toward harmonized approaches that would elevate FDA's confidence that food entering
the United States meets U.S. safety standards. Such harmonization would also support U.S. exports. For example,
after January 1, 1995, unless seafood products for import into the EU are produced under HACCP, the EU will carry out
extensive end-product testing, and the competitiveness of importers will be significantly affected. How should
FDA approach any effort to harmonize HACCP standards with those of other countries? What role should the Codex play?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Potential Costs and Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is also requesting relevant economic information. In particular, FDA seeks estimates of the following
costs: (1) The initial costs of developing a HACCP plan and the frequency and costs of altering the plan; (2) costs of
monitoring and recordkeeping by type of process, product, and packaging, and the costs of reviewing records before
shipment; (3) costs of necessary training of employees, and rate of turnover of employees; (4) administrative costs
to oversee all phases of HACCP implementation and operation; (5) the cost of monitoring equipment and other types
of equipment needed to implement a HACCP program; (6) the cost and frequency of corrective actions when critical limits
are exceeded; (7) the potential cost to the industry of FDA inspections of HACCP programs; (8) cost of testing for chemical
and contaminant residues as a component of HACCP; (9) cost of process redesign; (10) cost of new product design; and
(11) the costs of any consultants that might be required under a HACCP approach. FDA also seeks comments about the costs
of expanding HACCP to elements of the food industry other than manufacturers and processors, such as retail supermarkets
and restaurants, food transporters, and raw material suppliers. FDA is particularly interested in the cost experience
of small firms who have implemented HACCP, and how HACCP implementation by these firms is different from that of large
firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also announcing its intention to survey the food processing industry (except for seafood) to estimate the costs
of complying with mandatory HACCP requirements and requests comments on how such a survey should be designed and implemented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also interested in receiving comments on benefits of mandating HACCP for particular products, processes,
and packaging. Thus, FDA is seeking information about the existing risk levels presented by various foods, including
risk from microorganisms, contaminants, and chemical residues from all interested parties, including State and
other Federal agencies. FDA is also interested in receiving information concerning any quantitative reductions
in risk that have been documented by firms now using HACCP, or other evidence that would document that illness or other
food borne risks have been reduced through use of HACCP. FDA also is interested in receiving information that documents
savings in production costs or indirect benefits, such as increased quality, that firms using HACCP have experienced.
Because many risks are the result of consumer mishandling, FDA requests comments on the extent of this source of illness
or other food borne risks, and how this information should be used to target HACCP efforts. Finally, FDA requests comments
on the benefits of extending HACCP to the other areas of the food industry that are mentioned above.

I. Potential Environmental Effects
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is also requesting relevant environmental information because, under the National Environmental Policy
Act, FDA must consider the environmental impact of its actions. The agency does not currently possess the data that
would permit detailed analysis of the environmental impact of the action under consideration by the agency, as described
in this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agency is requesting information on the potential environmental impact including: (1) Potential
for increased energy consumption, (2) potential for increased disposal of defective foods, (3) potential for new
or increased disposal of sanitizing products, (4) a description of measures that could be taken to avoid or mitigate
adverse environmental impacts that might result from this action, and (5) potential for increased paper consumption.
