<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to implement the ``Performance Management
and Recognition System Termination Act of 1993'' (Pub. L. 103&hyph;89), which provides for the temporary extension
and orderly termination of the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) and specifies how former PMRS
employees will be paid.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 15, 1993, at 58 FR 65531, OPM published interim regulations to implement the ``Performance Management
and Recognition System Termination Act of 1993'' (Pub. L. 103&hyph;89), with a 60-day comment period. These regulations
were made effective retroactive to November 1, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 30, 1993, at 58 FR 69169, OPM published final regulations to implement locality-based comparability
payments under the ``Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990'' (FEPCA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;509). The locality
pay regulations revised the definitions of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
scheduled annual rate of pay 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in &sect;&sect;531.101 and 531.301 which were previously published in the interim regulations implementing the
PMRS Termination Act. The final regulations on locality pay were made effective January 1, 1994, and were applicable
on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 3, 1994, at 59 FR 5223, OPM published corrections to fix three typographical errors in the interim regulations
for PMRS termination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the comment period, which ended February 14, 1994, OPM received three comments, each from a different Federal
agency. One agency suggested revising the regulations to clarify that employees cannot ``become'' GM employees
after November 1, 1993, and to specify the personnel actions that would trigger loss of GM status. A second agency asked
for clarification of whether an employee who loses coverage as a result of a temporary promotion regains coverage
when the temporary promotion ends, and if so, how the employee's pay would be set. A third agency felt that the text of
&sect;531.406(b)(2) (i)&hyph;(iii) specifying when time in a non-pay status is creditable service for a within-grade
increase should be simplified. The agency also asserted that certain definitions in &sect;&sect;531.101 and 531.301
were superseded by revised definitions in the final locality pay regulations. Finally, it was called to our attention
that the instructions for setting pay on loss of GM status should be revised to clarify that pay retention is not required
if an employee requests a reduction in grade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following are the major issues raised, a summary of comments on each issue, and a discussion of changes made to the interim
regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The definition of GM employee and loss of status as a GM employee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary of Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One agency suggested that the statutory basis (Pub. L. 103&hyph;89) for the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
GM employee 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
should be introduced in its regulatory definition in &sect;531.202. The agency also noted that the timing and basis
for GM status could be clarified. Another agency specifically asked for clarification of whether an employee who
loses GM status when temporarily promoted after October 31, 1993, regains GM status when the temporary promotion
ends.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion and Changes:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OPM is adopting the suggestion that section 4 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;89, the Performance Management and Recognition
System Termination Act of 1993, be introduced in the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
GM employee
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (see &sect;531.202(e)). Where possible, we are replacing references to coverage under section 4 of the Act with references
to the amended definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
GM employee
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and, where appropriate, to a new paragraph, ``status as a GM employee'' (see &sect;531.203(g)), which specifies
personnel actions under which an employee would retain or permanently lose GM status (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
531.204 (d), (e) and (f), and &sect;536.308(b)(3)). Also, &sect;531.204(d) and the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
GM employee 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
have been amended to remove any suggestion that status as a GM employee can be acquired any time other than on November
1, 1993, the effective date of section 4 of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a temporary promotion begins after October 31, 1993, coverage under section 4 of the PMRS Termination Act (GM
status) ends because of the change in grade. Coverage cannot be regained once it is lost because it is linked to continuous
service as a supervisor or management official in the same grade and in the same agency after October 31, 1993. Coverage
is acquired only once, on November 1, 1993.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the employee's return to the lower grade, the agency must set pay using GS pay setting rules. The agency may restore
the employee's rate of basic pay to what it would have been had there never been a temporary promotion (including any
within-grade or merit increases that would have been granted at the lower grade). Also, if permitted by its own policies,
the agency may instead set pay at a higher rate using the highest previous rate under &sect;531.203(d). In either pay-setting
procedure, if the recomputed rate of basic pay falls between steps of a GS grade or a special salary rate schedule, the
rate of basic pay must be set at the next higher step within the lower grade. To clarify this policy, OPM has added a new
paragraph entitled, ``expiration or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
termination of temporary promotions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' (see &sect;531.204(c)). This replaces OPM guidance that was previously published in Federal Personnel Manual
(FPM) Supplement 990&hyph;2, Book 531, S4&hyph;5d. That guidance has been abolished by the sunset of the FPM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Setting pay on loss of GM status through voluntary reduction in grade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary of Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It was called to our attention that the regulation on setting pay on loss of GM status implies that an employee retains
pay if he or she is voluntarily reduced in grade (see redesignated 5 CFR 531.204(e)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion and Change:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A new paragraph has been added to clarify that the provisions of &sect;531.204(e) (1) through (4) do not apply when
an employee loses GM status as a result of a reduction in grade at the employee's request (see &sect;531.204(f)(3)).
Rather, an agency may set pay at the lowest step of the lower grade or at a higher step in the lower grade under its policies
for applying the maximum payable rate rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Creditable service in a waiting period for a within-grade-increase when an employee is in a non-pay status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary of Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One agency proposed simplifying regulatory text by combining separate language for GS and GM employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion and Change:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OPM is removing unnecessary references to steps, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
next higher rate within the grade,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
GM employee
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in &sect;531.406(b)(2) (i)&hyph;(iii) to be consistent with the language used to establish the length of waiting
periods in &sect;531.405.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The impact of final locality pay regulations on PMRS termination regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary of Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One agency commented that the revised definitions in &sect;&sect;531.101 and 531.301 of the interim regulations
are no longer current since the definitions were subsequently revised again by the final regulations implementing
locality pay adjustments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion and Change:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This comment is partially correct. The current definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
scheduled annual rate of pay 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in &sect;&sect;531.101 and 531.301 is the definition as revised in the locality pay regulations published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 30, 1993 (58 FR 69169). However, the current definition of employee in &sect;531.101 is the definition
as revised in the interim PMRS termination regulations. There is no change, except that a statutory reference in the
employee definition in &sect;531.101 is clarified by inserting ``of title 5.''

Editorial Revisions to Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
References to the PMRS Termination Act in &sect;&sect;530.306(b)(2), 531.401(d), and 531.502 are clarified by
replacing ``Public Law 103&hyph;89'' with ``the Performance Management and Recognition System Termination Act
of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;89).'' References to GM employee in &sect;&sect;531.203(c)(2) and 531.205(a)(2)(i)
are clarified by inserting the citation, ``(as defined in &sect;531.202).'' Also, minor editorial changes are being
made to correct errors or clarify text at &sect;&sect;531.204(e)(1), 531.205(a)(2) (ii) through (iv), 531.403,
531.405(a) (1) and (2), and 536.308 (a) and (b).

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are allowing, under certain conditions, the cold treatment of imported fruits upon arrival at the port of Wilmington,
NC. We have determined that in the Wilmington, NC, area, there are climatic and biological barriers that are adequate
to prevent the introduction of certain plant pests into the United States in the event they escape from shipments of
fruit before undergoing cold treatment. Also, we are deleting the listings of cold treatments in the regulations
and replacing them with a reference to the cold treatments in the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual,
which is incorporated by reference.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Fruits and Vegetables regulations, contained in 7 CFR 319.56 through 319.56&hyph;8 (referred to below as ``the
regulations''), prohibit or restrict the importation of fruits and vegetables to prevent the introduction and dissemination
of injurious insects, including fruit flies, that are new to or not widely distributed in the United States. The Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture administers these regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;319.56&hyph;2d of the regulations, APHIS allows certain fruits to be imported into the United States
if they undergo sustained refrigeration (cold treatment) sufficient to kill certain insect pests. Cold treatment
temperature and refrigeration period requirements vary according to the type of fruit and the pests involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 13, 1994, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 24968&hyph;24971, Docket No. 93&hyph;121&hyph;2) a proposal to amend the regulations to allow the cold treatment
of imported fruits upon arrival at the port of Wilmington, NC. We also proposed to delete the listings of cold treatments
in the regulations and replace them with a reference to the cold treatments in the Plant Protection and Quarantine
Treatment Manual, which is incorporated by reference. We also proposed to make a nonsubstantive editorial change.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day comment period ending June 13, 1994. We received two comments
by that date. One, from a State agency, supports the rule. The other comment, from a port authority, asked that we continue
to consider allowing cold treatment to be conducted at Gulfport, MS. We are still considering whether to allow cold
treatment to be conducted at Gulfport. Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this
document, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule without change.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes
of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are allowing, under certain conditions, the cold treatment of imported fruit upon arrival at the port of Wilmington,
NC. As a result of this action, a number of different fruits could be imported into Wilmington, NC. Specifically, officials
of the North Carolina State Ports Authority in Wilmington, NC, anticipate that apples, grapes, and pears from Argentina,
Brazil, and South Africa will be imported and cold treated at the port of Wilmington, NC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 20 million pounds of each fruit could be imported annually into Wilmington, NC, as a result of this action,
though we anticipate the amount will be much smaller. While some of the fruit arriving at Wilmington, NC, will be imported
in addition to the present volume of annual imports into the United States, some will be shipments diverted from other
ports also approved to conduct cold treatment on arrival. In the following analysis of the potential impact of this
action on domestic producers of apples, grapes and pears, in order to demonstrate the greatest possible economic
impact, we have assumed that the maximum amount of fruit will be imported into Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment,
and further, that those commodities will be imported in addition to the present volume of annual imports into the United
States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also in the following analysis, we have used published price flexibilities to estimate the potential economic effects
of allowing apples, grapes, and pears to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC; flexibilities are used to estimate relationships
between changes in supply and subsequent changes in price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Apples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1987, 36,718 farms in the United States, of which 1,186 were in North Carolina, harvested apples. Although it is
not known how many of these farms could be classified as small entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less,
according to Small Business Administration (SBA) size standards), it is likely that most would. In 1992, domestic
farms produced almost 5.78 billion pounds of apples for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $1.13 billion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the volume of apples imported into Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment were to reach 20 million pounds, it would constitute
about 7.5 percent of current total imports into the United States, about 0.35 percent of current domestic production
and about 0.33 percent of the current total apple supply in the United States (domestic and imports). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming that a 0.33 percent increase in the supply of apples would lead to a decrease of about 0.20 percent in the domestic
price of apples (using a price flexibility for apples of -0.590, based on all Eastern States' sales of North Carolina
apples), we estimate that this increase in supply would result in a price decrease of about $0.038 per hundredweight
(cwt), or $0.00038 per pound, from an original price of $0.195 per pound. As a result of the price decrease, there could
be a decrease in total revenue to U.S. apple producers of about $2.20 million, which is roughly 0.20 percent of the original
total revenue of $1.13 billion. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing apples to be cold treated at Wilmington,
NC, will not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers or other small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1987, 23,236 farms in the United States, of which 286 were in North Carolina, harvested apples. In 1992 domestic
farms produced about 1.54 billion pounds of grapes for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $327 million. Although
it is not known how many of these farms could be classified as small entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million
or less, according to SBA size standards), it is likely that most would. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the volume of grapes to be imported were to reach 20 million pounds, it would constitute about 2.9 percent of current
total imports to the United States, about 1.3 percent of current domestic production and about 0.89 percent of the
current total grape supply in the United States (domestic and imports). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming that a 0.89 percent increase in the supply of grapes would lead to a decrease of about 0.88 percent in the domestic
price of grapes (using a price flexibility for California grapes of -0.981), we estimate that this increase in supply
would result in a price decrease of about $3.73 per ton, or $0.0019 per pound, from an original price of $425.62 per ton.
As a result of the price decrease, there could be a decrease in total revenue to U.S. grape producers of about $2.9 million,
which is roughly 0.88 percent of the original total revenue of $327 million. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing
grapes to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC, will not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers or other
small entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1987, 10,092 farms in the United States, 88 of which were in North Carolina, harvested pears. In 1992, domestic farms
produced about 890 million pounds of pears for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $168 million. Although
it is not known how many of these farms could be classified as small entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million
or less, according to SBA size standards), it is likely that most would. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the volume of pears to be imported were to reach 20 million pounds, it would constitute about 15.4 percent of current
total imports to the United States, about 2.2 percent of current domestic production and about 2.0 percent of the current
total pear supply in the United States (domestic and imports). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming that a 2.0 percent increase in the supply of pears would lead to a decrease of about 1.2 percent in the domestic
price of pears (using a price flexibility for California pears of -0.609), we estimate that this increase in supply
would result in a price decrease of about $4.51 per ton, or $0.0023 per pound, from an original price of $377.61 per ton.
As a result of the price decrease, there could be a decrease in total revenue to U.S. pear producers of about $2.0 million,
which is roughly 1.19 percent of the original total revenue of $168 million. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing
pears to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC, will not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers or other
small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in light of the preceding analyses (which estimate greatest possible, and thus highly unlikely, economic
effects), as well as our expectation that most imports of fruit to Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment will occur during
the off-season for domestic production, we anticipate that this action will not have a significant economic impact
on domestic producers of apples, grapes, and pears, or other small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, we anticipate that allowing cold treatment at the port of Wilmington, NC, could have beneficial economic
effects. Importers who routinely transport fruit to the Southeastern United States could benefit from this action
due to lower transportation costs. Freight companies and shipping companies in North Carolina, as well as the local
economy, might also benefit. Also, consumers are likely to gain from the increased selection of products and any price
decreases, albeit small, that occur with increases in supply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule allows cold treatment of certain fruits to be conducted at the port of Wilmington, NC. State and local
laws and regulations regarding the importation of fruits under this rule will be preempted while the fruits are in
foreign commerce. Fresh fruits are generally imported for immediate distribution and sale to the consuming public,
and will remain in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question of when foreign commerce ceases
in other cases must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. No retroactive effect will be given to this rule, and this
rule will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.

 We are amending the regulations concerning Federal accreditation of veterinarians to add a definition of ``sign.''
Adding this definition will clarify that accredited veterinarians are prohibited from authorizing other persons
to sign certain official documents. We have determined that this change is necessary to maintain the integrity of

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR parts 160, 161, and 162 pertain to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's (APHIS)
veterinary accreditation program. Through this program, APHIS authorizes veterinarians in private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice to perform certain official services and duties on behalf of APHIS Veterinary Services officials. These
responsibilities include such activities as examining livestock for clinical signs of disease, vaccinating animals
for brucellosis, drawing and shipping blood for testing, and preparing health certificates required for domestic
or international movement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 161.3 (hereafter referred to as the regulations) sets forth the standards for accredited veterinarian duties.
The regulations cover several requirements and prohibitions regarding the preparation of official forms, certificates,
records and reports. The regulations use the term ``sign.'' As used in the regulations, ``sign'' means that an accredited
veterinarian signs a document, in his or her own hand. However, ``sign'' is not defined in the regulations. This has
led to some confusion concerning the signature requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, to clarify the regulations, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 18, 1994 (58 FR 12863&hyph;12864, Docket No. 93&hyph;033&hyph;1), a proposal to amend the regulations to
add a definition of ``sign.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending May 17, 1994. We received two comments
by that date. They were from a state department of agriculture and from a veterinary medical association. One commenter
supported the proposed rule. The other commenter objected to the proposed rule, saying it is the prerogative of business
owners, including veterinarians, to authorize other individuals to sign documents using the business owner's name.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not making any changes in the rule based on this comment. A business owner's right to authorize others to sign
documents is not unlimited. Accredited veterinarians are authorized by the Federal Government to perform certain
functions on behalf of the Federal Government. These include signing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents. Veterinarians are accredited only if they meet certain standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other persons, to whom veterinarians might delegate their responsibilities under the accreditation program, might
not meet the Federal Government's accreditation standards. This could lead to foreign animal health officials losing
confidence in the integrity of the veterinary accreditation program. This, in turn, could result in the loss of export
markets for U.S. livestock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the proposal as a final rule without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for
purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule will merely clarify that accredited veterinarians must sign official documents in their own hand.
We do not anticipate that this final rule will have any economic effect whatsoever. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 214B,
214B&hyph;1, and 214ST helicopters, that establishes a mandatory retirement life of 60,000 high-power events for
the main rotor trunnion (trunnion), which is currently not a life-limited part. This amendment is prompted by the
manufacturer's analysis and retesting that has shown that frequent takeoffs and external load lifts (high-power
events) shorten the life of the trunnion. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent fatigue failure
of the trunnion, loss of the main rotor, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 214B, 214B&hyph;1, and 214ST helicopters was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 5, 1994 (59 FR 556). That action proposed to establish a mandatory retirement life of 60,000 high-power
events for the main rotor trunnion (trunnion), part number (P/N) 214&hyph;010&hyph;230&hyph;101, which is currently
not a life-limited part. High-power events are takeoffs and external load lifts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. However, the FAA has added a sentence
to paragraph (d) of this AD dealing with the retirement life of this part to make it clear that the retirement life established
is 60,000 high-power events; but, since this AD establishes a new method of determining the retirement life, those
trunnions that have 59,400 or more high-power events need not be retired until on or before the accumulation of an additional
600 high-power events. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule
as proposed with this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this change will not increase the scope of the AD. However, the FAA has performed a more detailed
cost analysis and has determined that, when factoring in the creation and maintenance of the component history card
or equivalent record, the anticipated costs are $9,900 higher than the proposed amount for the first year and $8,525
higher than the proposed amount for each subsequent year. In the proposal, the cost of this AD was estimated to be $29,523
each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 15 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, and that (1) it will take approximately
16 work hours per helicopter to replace the affected part due to the new method of determining the retirement life required
by this AD; (2) it will take approximately 2 work hours per helicopter to create the component history card or equivalent
record (record); (3) it will take approximately 10 work hours per helicopter to maintain the record each year; and
(4) the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $10,929 per helicopter. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators for the first year is estimated to be $39,423 and each
subsequent year to be $38,048, assuming replacement of the trunnion in one-sixth of the fleet each year, and creation
and maintenance of the records for all the fleet the first year and creation of one-sixth of the records and maintenance
of the records for all the fleet each subsequent year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. This AD and any related information may be examined in the Rules Docket at the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort
Worth, Texas.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To prevent fatigue failure of the trunnion as a result of takeoffs and external load lifts (high-power events), that
could result in loss of the main rotor and subsequent loss of the helicopter, accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Within the next 25 hours' time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD),
accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Create a component history card or an equivalent record for the affected trunnion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Determine the actual TIS of the trunnion from maintenance records, if possible. If the actual TIS cannot be determined,
use a TIS of 900 hours per year. Prorate the hours for a partial year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For Model 214B and 214B-1 helicopters, determine and record the accumulated high-power events on the trunnion
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the number of high-power events is unknown, assign 12 high-power events for each hour TIS obtained in accordance
with paragraph (a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the number of high-power events is known, divide that number by 2 and record the resulting number as the total
accumulated high-power events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For Model 214ST helicopters, determine and record the accumulated high-power events on the trunnion as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the number of high-power events is unknown, assign 11 high-power events for each hour TIS obtained in accordance
with paragraph (a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the number of high-power events is known, record that number as the total accumulated high-power events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After the effective date of this AD, continue to record high-power events. For Model 214B and 214B-1 helicopters,
divide the number of high-power events as they occur by 2 and add the resulting number to the previously recorded sum.
For Model 214ST helicopters, add the high-power events as they occur to the previously recorded sum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Remove the trunnion and replace it with an airworthy trunnion in accordance with the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For each trunnion with 59,400 or more high-power events, replace with an airworthy trunnion on or before the accumulation
of an additional 600 high-power events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For each trunnion with less than 59,400 high-power events, replace the trunnion with an airworthy trunnion on
or before attaining 60,000 high-power events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) This AD revises the helicopter Airworthiness Limitations Section of the maintenance manual by establishing
a new retirement life for the trunnion of 60,000 high-power events. However, trunnions with 59,400 or more high-power
events need not be retired until on or before the accumulation of an additional 600 high-power events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate.
Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment
and then send it to the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment rescinds 14 Airworthiness Directives (AD), which are applicable to all Airbus Industrie Model A300
series airplanes. Those AD's require repetitive inspections to detect fatigue cracks in certain areas of the fuselage,
wings, and horizontal stabilizer; and repair, if necessary. The requirements of those AD's were intended to prevent
reduced structural capability of the fuselage, wings, and horizontal stabilizer. Since the issuance of those AD's,
the FAA has issued an AD that requires the accomplishment of certain inspections or modifications that terminate
the requirements of the 14 AD's issued previously.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those AD's require repetitive inspections to detect fatigue cracks in certain areas of the fuselage, wings, and horizontal
stabilizer; and repair, if necessary. Those actions were prompted by full-scale fatigue testing by the airplane
manufacturer, which revealed cracking in certain areas of the fuselage, wings, and horizontal stabilizer. Those
conditions, if not corrected, could result in reduced structural capability of the fuselage, wings, and horizontal
stabilizer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of those AD's, the FAA has issued AD 93&hyph;01&hyph;24, amendment 39&hyph;8478 (58 FR 6703, February
2, 1993), which requires supplemental structural inspections to detect fatigue cracking, and repair or replacement,
if necessary; or the installation of specific modifications on certain Airbus Industrie Model A300 series airplanes.
Paragraph (j) of AD 93&hyph;01&hyph;24 specifies that accomplishment of the requirements of that AD constitutes
terminating action for the 14 AD's listed previously. AD 93&hyph;01&hyph;24 became effective on March 9, 1993, and
the actions specified in that AD were required to be accomplished within one year after that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the actions required by AD 93&hyph;01&hyph;24 were required to be accomplished by March 9, 1994, and because
such accomplishment constitutes terminating action for the requirements of the 14 AD's listed previously, the FAA
has determined that it is necessary to rescind those AD's in order to eliminate redundant requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this action rescinds requirements that have been rendered moot by subsequent AD action, it has no adverse economic
impact and imposes no additional burden on any person. For the same reason, the FAA has determined that there is no particular
public interest in this action. Therefore, notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary and the rescission
may be made effective upon publication in the

This action establishes Class E airspace at Lyndonville, VT. This action is a result of a modification of the nondirectional
beacon (NDB) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) for Runway 2 at the Caledonia County Airport which showed
a need for controlled airspace upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations
at the airport. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators who will
be executing the NDB SIAP at Caledonia County Airport.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 11, 1994, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Lyndonville, VT (59 FR 11565). The proposal was prompted
by a modification of the nondirectional beacon (NDB) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) for Runway 2
at the Caledonia Airport which showed a need for controlled airspace upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain
instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate
Class E airspace for IFR operators who will be executing the NDB SIAP at Caledonia County Airport. Interested parties
were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal of the FAA.
No comments on the proposal were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published
in Paragraph 6005 of the FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298, July 6, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Class E airspace establishment listed in this document will be published in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment of part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes the Class E Airspace at Claremont, NH. This
action is a result of a modification of the nondirectional beacon (NDB) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP)
for Runway 2 at the Caledonia County Airport which showed a need for controlled airspace upward from 700 feet above
the surface to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. The intended effect of this action
is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators who will be executing the NDB SIAP at Caledonia County Airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation involves only an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep these regulations operationally current. It, therefore_(1)
is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a Regulatory
Evaluation as the anticipated economic cost will be so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect
air traffic procedures and air navigation, the FAA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This action establishes Class E airspace at Claremont, NH. This action is a result of a review of a nondirectional beacon
(NDB) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) for Claremont Airport, which showed a need for controlled airspace
upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations executing that NDB SIAP
at the airport. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators who will
be executing the NDB SIAP at Claremont, NH.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 11, 1994, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Claremont, NH (59 FR 11564). The proposal was prompted
by a review of a proposed nondirectional beacon (NDB) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) for Claremont
Airport, which showed a need for controlled airspace upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain instrument
flight rules (IFR) operations executing that NDB SIAP at the airport. The intended effect of this action is to provide
adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators who will be executing the proposed NDB SIAP at Claremont, NH.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal of the FAA. No comments on the proposal were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298, July 6, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Class E airspace establishment listed in this document will be published in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment of part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes the Class E airspace at Claremont, NH. This
action is a result of a review of a proposed nondirectional beacon (NDB) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP)
for Claremont Airport which showed a need for controlled airspace upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain
instrument flight rules (IFR) operations executing that NDB SIAP at the airport. The intended effect of this action
is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators who will be executing the proposed NDB SIAP at Claremont,
NH.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation involves only an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep these regulations operationally current. It, therefore_(1)
is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a Regulatory
Evaluation as the anticipated economic cost will be so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect
air traffic procedures and air navigation, the FAA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 11, 1992 (57 FR 35833), FDA announced that a color additive petition (CAP 6C0204) had been filed by CTFA, 1101
17th St. NW., suite 300, Washington, DC 20036. The petition proposed that the color additive regulations for D&amp;C
Green No. 5 be amended to provide for the safe use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 for coloring drugs and cosmetics intended for
use in the area of the eye. The petition was filed under section 706 (currently section 721) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 376) (currently 21 U.S.C. 379e).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulatory history of D&amp;C Green No. 5 is summarized in a final rule that was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 4, 1982 (47 FR 24278). In that final rule, FDA permanently listed D&amp;C Green No. 5 for use in drugs and cosmetics
excluding use in the area of the eye. These actions were taken in response to a color additive petition (CAP 8C0084).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 70.3(s) (21 CFR 70.3(s)) defines the term ``area of the eye'' as ``the area enclosed within the circumference
of the supra-orbital ridge and the infra-orbital ridge, including the eyebrow, the skin below the eyebrow, the eyelids
and the eyelashes, and conjunctival sac of the eye, the eyeball, and the soft areolar tissue that lies within the perimeter
of the infra-orbital ridge.'' 21 CFR 70.5(a) states that ``No listing or certification of a color additive shall be
considered to authorize the use of any such color additive in any article intended for use in the area of the eye unless
such listing or certification of such color additive specifically provides for such use.'' The petitioner has requested
that the uses for D&amp;C Green No. 5 be expanded to include drug and cosmetic uses in the area of the eye.

IV. The Color Additive
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
D&amp;C Green No. 5 is principally the disodium salt of 2,2'-[(9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxo-1,4-anthracenediyl)diimino]bis-[5-methylbenzenesulfonic
acid] (CAS Reg. No. 4403&hyph;90&hyph;1). The manufacture of D&amp;C Green No. 5 is accomplished by the sulfonation
of D&amp;C Green No. 6 with fuming sulfuric acid. Because D&amp;C Green No. 6 is the starting material in this manufacturing
process, the possibility exists that the chemicals used in the synthesis of D&amp;C Green No. 6 may be present in minor
amounts in D&amp;C Green No. 5. D&amp;C Green No. 6 is formed by chemically reacting one molecule of quinizarin with
two molecules of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine. The significance of these components is that Weisburger et al. have demonstrated that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine is a carcinogen in mice (Ref. 1). Residual amounts of reactants, such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine and related manufacturing aids, are commonly found among the constituents of many color additives. The
presence of such constituents, however, is not unique to color additives. Numerous contaminants are unavoidably
present in all chemical products, even in highly purified reagent grade chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although D&amp;C Green No. 5 has itself not been shown to cause cancer, it does contain minor amounts of a carcinogenic
impurity,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 June 4, 1982 (47 FR 24278), permanently listing D&amp;C Green No. 5 for use in drugs and cosmetics, excluding use in
the area of the eye.

V. Determination of Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 721(b)(4) of the act (21 U.S.C. 379e(b)(4)), the so-called ``general safety clause'' for color additives,
a color additive cannot be listed for a particular use unless a fair evaluation of the data available to FDA establishes
that the color additive is safe for that use. FDA's color additive regulations (&sect;70.3(i)) define safe as ``convincing
evidence that establishes with a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the intended use of the color additive.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The anticancer or Delaney clause of the Color Additive Amendments (section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
721(b)(5)(B) of the act) provides that a noningested color additive shall be deemed unsafe and shall not be listed
if, after tests that are appropriate for evaluating the safety of the additive for such use, it is found to induce cancer
in man or animal. Importantly, however, the Delaney clause applies to the additive itself and not to constituents
of the additive. That is, where an additive itself has not been shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity,
the additive is properly evaluated under the general safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine
whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposed use of the additive (

VI. Safety of the Petitioned Use of the Additive
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA estimates from the data submitted and other relevant information that the exposure to D&amp;C Green No. 5 from
its use in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye, is 0.56 milligrams per person per day (mg/p/d),
based upon a maximum frequency of application and maximum quantity applied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic toxicological testing to be necessary to determine the safety of an additive
whose use will result in such low exposure levels (Ref. 2), and the agency has not required such testing here. Although
the agency does not normally require such testing, chronic studies supporting current listings for the use of D&amp;C
Green No. 5 are available in the agency's files, and FDA's safety evaluation for the proposed use of the color additive
in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye included a consideration of these studies. Two-year carcinogenicity
studies of D&amp;C Green No. 5 showed no indication of carcinogenicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safety clause, considering all available data. The
agency has used risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound limit of risk presented by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine, the carcinogenic chemical that may be present as an impurity in the additive. The risk evaluation of this
chemical has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the exposure to the impurity from the proposed use of the additive, and
(2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable exposure to humans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA estimates that the maximum total lifetime exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine that will result from the use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of
the eye that complies with the applicable specifications is 8.4 nanograms (ng)/p/d. This exposure estimate was based
on the use of this color additive in eyebrow pencil, eyeliner, eye shadow, eye lotion, eye makeup remover, mascara,
eye cream, eye shadow base, and eye stick.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency used data reported by the National Cancer Institute which demonstrated that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine was carcinogenic for male and female Charles River CD&hyph;1 (HaM/ICR derived) mice, causing an increased
incidence of hepatomas (liver tumors) (Ref. 1) to estimate the upper-bound limit of lifetime human risk from exposure
to this chemical stemming from the proposed use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 as a color additive in drugs and cosmetics intended
for use in the area of the eye (Ref. 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a potential exposure of 8.4 ng/p/d, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limits of individual lifetime risk
from the potential exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine from the proposed use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 as a color additive in eye area drugs and cosmetics is 2 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or 2 in 1 billion (Ref. 4). Moreover, FDA points out that in an earlier determination of the risk from exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine from all other uses of D&amp;C Green No. 5, the agency calculated the upper-bound limits of individual
lifetime risk to be in the 1 in 30 million to 1 in 300 million range (47 FR 24278). Thus, the use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 in
eye area drugs and cosmetics does not increase this risk in any way. The agency also points out that because of the numerous
conservative assumptions used in calculating the exposure estimate, actual lifetime-averaged individual exposure
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine is expected to be substantially less than the worst-case exposure. Therefore, the actual upper-bound
limits of risk would be less than that cited above. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty
of no harm from exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine that might result from the proposed use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 for coloring drugs and cosmetics intended
for use in the area of the eye. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its evaluation of the safety of the proposed use of the subject additive, FDA has also considered other safety data
submitted previously to support current listings for the use of D&amp;C Green No. 5. These toxicity studies of D&amp;C
Green No. 5, involving dogs, rats, and mice, included acute oral toxicity studies, subchronic studies, and chronic
toxicity studies in which animals were exposed to the color additive through diet and skin applications, and reproductive
toxicity studies. These studies did not produce any evidence that D&amp;C Green No. 5 would be unsafe for the petitioned
uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FDA evaluated the ocular toxicity studies that the petitioner provided to support the proposed use of
D&amp;C Green No. 5 in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye. Almost all of the animals were free
of signs of ocular irritation. The effects noted in most animals that exhibited irritation were slight conjunctival
redness or discharge. These irritations were seen sporadically in both control and test animals. Based on its review
of these studies, FDA finds that there were no significant adverse clinical findings in the ocular irritation studies.

A. Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the available toxicity data and other relevant considerations discussed above, FDA concludes that there
is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 as a color additive in drugs and
cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye. The agency also concludes on the basis of available data that the color
additive will perform its intended technical effect and thus is suitable for the petitioned uses. The agency, therefore,
is amending &sect;&sect;74.1205(c)(2) and 74.2205(b) of the color additive regulations to provide for the use of
D&amp;C Green No. 5 in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye.

B. Specifications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
D&amp;C Green No. 5 is currently produced as a certifiable color additive for use in drugs and cosmetics excluding
use in the area of the eye in amounts consistent with current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR
part 80. Based upon the low level of exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine that results under the current specifications for D&amp;C Green No. 5 in &sect;&sect;74.1205 and 74.2205
(21 CFR 74.1205 and 74.2205), the agency concludes that the specifications listed in &sect;74.1205 are adequate
to ensure the safe use of this color additive and to control the amount of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidine that may exist as an impurity in the color additive when used in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the
area of the eye.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has evaluated data submitted in accordance with regulations promulgated under section 507 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 357), as amended, with respect to a request for approval of (1) a new antibiotic drug,
rifabutin, and (2) its use in a dosage form, rifabutin capsules. The agency has concluded that the data supplied by
the manufacturer concerning these antibiotic drugs are adequate to establish their safety and efficacy when used
as directed in the labeling and that the regulations should be amended in 21 CFR parts 430, 436, and 455 to include accepted
standards for these products.

Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

Submitting Comments and Filing Objections
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule announces standards that FDA has accepted in a request for approval of an antibiotic drug. Because
this final rule is not controversial and because when effective it provides notice of accepted standards, FDA finds
that notice and comment procedure is unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore, is effective
September 9, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before September 9, 1994, submit written comments to the
Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals
may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.
Received comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable
grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before September 9,
1994, a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before October 11, 1994, the data, information,
and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing
may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and
substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information,
and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action
taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making
findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the
docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission
of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained
in 21 CFR 314.300.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C.
331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

are thoroughly dry, place the plate into the trough in the bottom of the tank. Cover and tightly seal the tank, allow
the solvent front to travel about 15 centimeters from the starting line and then remove the plate from the tank. Air
dry the plate. Warm the iodine vapor chamber to vaporize the iodine crystals and place the dry plate in the iodine vapor
chamber until the spots are visible (usually about 5 minutes). Remove the plate from the iodine vapor chamber and spray
with 1 percent starch solution.

. Rifabutin capsules are gelatin capsules containing rifabutin with a suitable and harmless filler and with or without
binders, lubricants, and stabilizers. Each capsule contains rifabutin equivalent to 150 milligrams of rifabutin.
Its rifabutin content is satisfactory if it is not less than 90 percent and not more than 110 percent of the number of
milligrams of rifabutin that it is represented to contain. Its content of the four major related substances detected
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is not more than 1.0 percent each. All other unknown related substances
are not more than 0.5 percent. The total of all related substances is not more than 4.5 percent. It passes the dissolution
test if the quantity (Q) dissolved is 75 percent at 45 minutes. It passes the identity test. The rifabutin used conforms
to the standards prescribed by &sect;455.88(a)(1).

fill weight. Mix the powder and accurately weigh a portion containing the equivalent of about 25 milligrams of rifabutin
into a 50-milliliter volumetric flask. Add 5 milliliters of acetonitrile. Dilute to volume with mobile phase and
mix to yield a solution containing 0.5 milligram of rifabutin per milliliter (estimated). Filter through a suitable

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Defense (DoD) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of a proposed rule establishing
guidelines for the registration of public and community service organizations and a listing of separating DoD personnel
and their spouses to be maintained by the Department of Defense. The purpose of the public and community service organizational
registry is to provide an avenue for public and community service organizations to recruit highly skilled and experienced
separating DoD personnel and their spouses. The final rule encourages continuing public and community service for
separating Military Service members, as well as to implement the temporary early retirement authority as established
in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (hereinafter, ``the Act''). This registry will be
maintained indefinitely to encourage separating Service members to enter into public and community service job
vacancies, such as in education, conservation, environmental protection, law enforcement, and public health care
after separation from active duty. This action provides the necessary guidelines to determine how separating Military
Service members, DoD civilian personnel leaving the Government, and their spouses register for public and community
service employment, which organizations qualify for registration, and procedures qualifying organizations must
take to be placed on the registry.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is being issued after publication of a proposed rule on April 4, 1994 (59 FR 15673) in 32 CFR Part 77. There
were no public comments to the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is established in order to describe the organizational responsibilities within DoD for the program to encourage
public and community service employment and to state the general policy of DoD with respect to this program. It has
been certified that this rule would not be a significant rule. The rule would:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a section of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Not materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and
obligations of recipients thereof; or,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Not become subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because it is not likely to have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The primary effect on grantees administering the proposed
rule will be a reduction in administrative costs and other burdens resulting from the simplification and clarification
of certain policies and the elimination of policy differences among the federal agencies promulgating this final
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Impose a reporting requirement under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3250). The Office
of Management and Budget approved the reporting requirement and assigned control number 0704&hyph;0324.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold this event was not received by the Commander, Ninth
Coast Guard District until July 25, 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish a proposed rule in
advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date.

Discussion of Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The West Michigan Offshore Powerboat Challenge will be held on Lake Michigan, Grand Haven, MI on September 11, 1994.
This event will have an estimated 50&hyph;70 offshore powerboats, racing in a closed course on Lake Michigan which
could pose hazards to navigation in the area. The effect of this regulation will be to restrict general navigation
on that portion of Lake Michigan, between Grand Haven, MI and Port Sheldon, MI. This regulation is necessary to ensure
the protection of life, limb, and property during this event. Any vessel desiring to transit the regulated area may
do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander (Commanding Officer, U.S. Coast Guard Station Grand Haven,
MI).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1225 and 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 165.

Federalism Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

Environment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c
of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.

Economic Assessment and Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of the DOT is unnecessary.

Regulatory History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 8, 1994, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for these regulations (59 FR 10772). The Coast Guard did not receive any letters commenting on the proposal. The public
hearing was requested, and none was held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The anchorage for nitrate laden vessels off Honolulu Harbor was a hold over from World War II and no longer needed. It
encompassed much of the area available for commercial vessels to anchor off Honolulu Harbor. Eliminating the nitrate
anchorage allows the establishment of four new anchorages and better usage of the available anchoring area. This
rule brings the regulations in line with current practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No comments were received during the comment period. No changes were made to the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under
the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast
Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. The only
effect of this rule is to formally establish anchorage grounds for commercial vessels off Honolulu Harbor in areas
where they presently anchor. The rule does not restrict access to any fairway or channel, or limit access to any facility
or area previously accessible to vessels. The primary intent of the rule is to designate anchorages for commercial
vessels of Honolulu Harbor.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The impact of this rule on a substantial number of small entities is expected to be minimal. Therefore, the Coast Guard
certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Collection of Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principals and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612 and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

Environment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical
Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

 publication. Publishing an NPRM and delaying its effective date would be contrary to the public interest since immediate
action is needed to prevent potential hazards to the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS and the barge and other vessels that
may transit the area. Less than 30 days notice was given to the Coast Guard by the U.S. Navy, thus, there was not sufficient
time to publish proposed rules in advance of the event or to provide a delayed effective date. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would be impracticable.

Discussion of Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The event requiring this regulation will begin on August 10, 1994 at 6 a.m., PDT. Upon request by the U.S. Navy, the Coast
Guard is establishing a 300 yard moving safety zone around the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS, the towline, and the barge
60 while the vessels are in transit from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, through U.S. navigable
waters until south of Latitude 47
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;32
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;N, Queets, Washington, at 12 p.m. (PDT) on August 11, 1994. This transit may result in a large number of vessels
congregating near the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS and the barge or in their paths. Concern is justified due to the limited
maneuverability of the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS and the barge and for the safety of the mariners who may attempt to
approach the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS and the barge during their transit as well as other vessels in the immediate
vicinity. This moving safety zone will be enforced by representatives of the Captain of the Port Puget Sound, Seattle,
Washington. The Captain of the Port may be assisted by other federal agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Regulation is issued pursuant to 33 USC 1225 and 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 165.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This temporary final rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does
not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted
from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies
and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory
policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,

the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.

&rsquo;N, Queets, Washington, at 8 a.m. (PDT) on August 18, 1994. This transit may result in a large number of vessels
congregating near the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS and the barge or in their paths. Concern is justified due to the limited
maneuverability of the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS and the barge and for the safety of the mariners who may attempt to
approach the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS and the barge during their transit as well as other vessels in the immediate
vicinity. This moving safety zone will be enforced by representatives of the Captain of the Port Puget Sound, Seattle,
Washington. The Captain of the Port may be assisted by other federal agencies.

This temporary final rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does
not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted
from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies
and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory
policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, (``CAA'' or ``the Act''), will require many
small businesses to be regulated so that areas may attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards
(NAAQS) and the emission of air toxics will be reduced. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise
and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for
compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the Act requires that States
adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM),
and submit this PROGRAM to be incorporated as a revision of the Federally approved SIP. In addition, the Act directs
the USEPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The
requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of Title V of the Act. In February 1992, USEPA issued
Guidelines for the Implementation of section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, in order to delineate the Federal
and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further guidance to the States on submitting
an acceptable PROGRAM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to gain full approval, a State submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment
of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses;
(2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness
of the SBAP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 18, 1992 and January 21, 1993 the State of Wisconsin submitted such a PROGRAM to USEPA in order to satisfy
the requirements of section 507. The submittals contained the following portions of 1991 Wisconsin Act 269 and 1991
Wisconsin Act 302: Natural Resources (NR) 144.36_small business stationary source technical and environmental
compliance assistance program definitions; section 15.157(10) of the Wisconsin Statutes_small business environmental
council members; section 560.11 of the Wisconsin Statutes_small business environmental council duties; NR 144.399_fees;
section 560.03(9) of the Wisconsin Statutes_business and industrial development (small business ombudsman clearinghouse);
and section 96_nonstatutory provisions of 1991 Assembly Bill 1055_development.

II. Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Small Business Assistance Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements that the State must meet to have an approvable SBAP.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information
concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage
lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with the Act. The State has met this
requirement by requiring the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) to develop information pertaining
to the technical issues of regulations. The Wisconsin Department of Development (WDOD), the University of Wisconsin's
Small Business Development Center_Solid and Hazardous Waste Education Center, and the University of Wisconsin-Extension
Engineering Professional Development Center (University of Wisconsin-Extension) will assist WDNR in making the
materials understandable to the layperson. Rule developers will also analyze the impact of new regulations on small
business stationary sources to aid in the development of assistance materials. Advisory committees will be developed
to encourage lawful cooperation and compliance with the Act. Advisory committees will also be involved during rule
development, giving small businesses the opportunity to voice their concerns.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A seventh requirement of Section 507(a), establishment of an Ombudsman office, is discussed in the next section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with
pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning
alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. The
State has met this requirement by promoting pollution prevention and hazardous waste minimization through several
existing programs. Informational materials are developed by: WDNR's Pollution Prevention Office, WDNR's Bureau
of Solid and Hazardous Waste, and the University of Wisconsin-Extension. WDOD's Hazardous Pollution Prevention
Board coordinates and monitors hazardous pollution prevention, advises WDNR and the University of Wisconsin-Extension
in their pollution prevention efforts, provides hazardous pollution prevention reports to the Governor and the
State legislature, and awards pollution prevention audit grants to businesses and manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary
sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the
Act in a timely and efficient manner. The State has met this requirement by developing mechanisms to inform small business
stationary sources about applicable requirements through WDNR's Bureau of Air Management and WDOD's Small Business
Ombudsman's Office and Permit Information Center. These mechanisms include an 800 telephone service (1&hyph;800&hyph;HELP-BUS-iness);
permit applicability determinations; dissemination of written materials (including permit application process
guidance); individual technical and business consultations; and potential permit application workshops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive
notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to
evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under
the Act. The State has met this requirement by establishing information dissemination mechanisms to ensure that
small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the new regulations. These mechanisms include
public notices and hearings on draft State rules; mailings to trade associations, small businesses, and representatives
of small businesses; newspaper notices, radio and television announcements, and other media for widely disseminating
information; and an 800 telephone service. Preliminary notices will also be disseminated prior to adoption of a final
rule in order to allow businesses time to prepare for the impacts of a rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their
obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option
of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the Act. The State
has met this requirement by establishing information dissemination mechanisms to ensure that small business stationary
sources receive notice of their obligations under new regulations. These mechanisms are the same as those listed
above for notifying sources of their rights. In addition, Wisconsin has developed mechanisms for referring small
business stationary sources to qualified auditors. These mechanisms include providing information on Hazardous
Pollution Prevention Audit Grants, providing information through the University of Wisconsin-Extension Solid
and Hazardous Waste Education Center, and developing a guide to assist small business stationary sources in hiring
auditors. The SBAP may also develop a list of consultants which provide environmental compliance audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source
for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones
for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the
technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. The State has met this requirement
by addressing such requests through permit revision procedures. The SBAP will assist businesses with the permit
revision process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a State office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary
sources. The State has met this requirement by designating the WDOD as the Ombudsman, using several services offered
by WDOD, including the Small Business Ombudsman Clearinghouse, the Permit Information Center, and the 800 telephone
service. Two additional WDOD staff will be added to handle the additional responsibilities and workload that cannot
be met through existing WDOD services. Wisconsin's Small Business Ombudsman performs many duties, including: serving
as an information and assistance center for small businesses affected by the Act; assuming responsibility for program
evaluation, information collection and dissemination, and dispute resolution for small businesses; and working
with other State agencies and organizations that provide Act related services to small businesses to ensure that
information is useful and efficiently provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Compliance Advisory Panel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 507(e) requires the State to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) that must include two members selected
by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the State
legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency
in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The number of CAP members will be appointed and consistent with statues
according to section 507(e)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP, the Act delineates four responsibilities of the Panel:
(1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered, and the degree
and severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report to USEPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles
of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (3) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and (4)
to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. The State has met these requirements
by establishing the Small Business Environmental Council (SBEC) to meet these responsibilities. The SBEC consists
of representatives of small businesses, the public, the WDNR and the WDOD, and oversee the activities of the SBAP to
advise the program on how to improve its services. In addition, the Ombudsman staff and SBAP staff will provide support
for the SBEC in its efforts to carry out these responsibilities.

Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP to report on the compliance of the SBAP with these three Federal statutes. However,
since State agencies are not required to comply with them, U.S. EPA believes that the State PROGRAM must merely require
the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering to the general principles of these Federal statutes.

The State of Wisconsin has established a mechanism for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance
under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the
Act. Wisconsin intends to use these mechanisms only if the resources of the PROGRAM are abused by those for whom it was
not intended, or if the PROGRAM becomes overburdened by providing assistance to sources which do not meet the small
business stationary source definition. Pursuant to section 507(c)(2) of the Act, the State of Wisconsin has provided
for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(C),
(D), and (E) of the Act but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants. In response to petition by a stationary
source, WDNR may, by rule, extend the definition of small business stationary source as outlined above.

The State of Wisconsin has provided for exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation
with the USEPA and the Small Business Administration Administrator and after providing notice and opportunity for
public comment, of any category or subcategory of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical
and financial capabilities to meet the requirements of the Act. WDNR has the authority to narrow the definition in
this manner through rulemaking.

III. This Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Wisconsin has submitted a SIP revision implementing each of the required PROGRAM elements required by
section 507 of the Act. The Small Business Ombudsman elements began delivering assistance services in July 1993.
The SBEC was fully functional by October 1993. The SBAP will be fully implemented by the effective date of Wisconsin's
Title V Operating Permit Program, which may occur before November 1994. USEPA is, therefore, approving this submittal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because USEPA considers this final rule noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it today without prior proposal.
This rule will become effective on October 11, 1994. However, if we receive notice by September 9, 1994, that someone
wishes to submit adverse comments, then USEPA will publish: (1) A document that withdraws the action, and (2) a document
that begins a new rulemaking by proposing the action and establishing a comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting
Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional
Administrators). A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989 the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirement of section 3 of Executive
Order 12291 for a period of two years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP
revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993), USEPA must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, of State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, users fees, or loan programs or the rights and
obligations of recipients thereof; or

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this action, USEPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved today does not impose any new regulatory
burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance
provided by the State. Therefore, because the USEPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory
requirements on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities
affected.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency is granting an exemption to the Detroit-Ann Arbor ozone nonattainment
area from applicable oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) requirements found in the Clean Air Act (Act). Approval of the exemption would apply for various NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 including adoption and implementation of regulations addressing general conformity, transportation conformity,
inspection and maintenance, reasonably available control technology, and new source review. A NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption request was submitted by the State of Michigan on November 12, 1993. A subsequent letter dated May 31, 1994
clarified this earlier submittal. This request is based on the fact that the Detroit-Ann Arbor area has not monitored
a violation of the ozone standard for a 3-year period; 1991 to 1993. Given this monitoring data, Michigan may petition
for an exemption from the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements based on a demonstration that additional reductions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 would not contribute to attainment of the ozone standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rationale for this approval is set forth in this final rule; additional information is available at the address
indicated below. Elsewhere in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is proposing approval of, and soliciting public comment on, this requested SIP revision. If a comment, or a notice
of intent to comment is received on this direct final rule by August 25, 1994, EPA will then use this rulemaking as a proposed
rule. Comments received will be addressed in a separate final rulemaking. Unless this final rule is commented upon,
no further rulemaking will occur on this requested State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This shortened comment period and expedited effective date is needed to follow provisions found in the Act which require
EPA to either grant or deny exemption requests within 6 months of receipt. Although this notice may not be published
within the timeframe specified by the Act, it is EPA's intention to try and publish as close to the 6 month deadline as
possible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 12, 1993 the State of Michigan submitted a petition to the EPA requesting that the Detroit-Ann Arbor ozone
nonattainment area be exempted from the requirement to implement NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT controls pursuant to section 182(f) of the Act. The exemption request is based upon monitoring data which demonstrate
that the ozone standard has been attained in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area for a 3-year period; 1991 through 1993.

The NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT petition was submitted in accordance with section 182(f) of the Act and a May 27, 1994 John Seitz memorandum entitled,
``Section 182(f) Nitrogen Oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

entitled, Guideline for Determining the Applicability of Nitrogen Oxides Requirements Under Section 182(f), NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT and NSR requirements of section 182(f) do not apply if additional reductions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would not contribute to attainment of the NAAQS for ozone. In an area that did not implement the section 182(f) NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements, but did attain the ozone standard, it is clear that the additional NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reductions required by section 182(f) would not contribute to attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its submittal, the State included data from ozone monitors for the most recently recorded years, 1991&hyph;1993.
These data showed that over this 3-year period a violation of the ozone standard was not monitored in the Detroit-Ann
Arbor area. This is the main criterion by which EPA judges 182(f) exemption petitions based on monitoring data. Given
the fact that the Detroit-Ann Arbor area has not implemented the section 182(f) NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements and has submitted adequate monitoring data showing no violations of the ozone NAAQS over the last 3 years
in the area, EPA finds that the State submittal is approvable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

III. Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is granting the Detroit-Ann Arbor section 182(f) exemption petition based upon the evidence provided by the
State and the State's compliance with the requirements outlined in the Act and in EPA guidance. However, it should
be noted that this exemption is being granted on a contingent basis; i.e., the exemption will last for only as long as
the area's ambient monitoring data continue to demonstrate attainment of the ozone NAAQS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This approval does not create any new requirements. Therefore, I certify that this action does not have a significant
impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act,
preparation of the regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness
of the State action. The Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

(c) Approval_On November 12, 1993, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources submitted a petition for exemption
from the oxides of nitrogen requirements of the Clean Air Act for the Detroit-Ann Arbor ozone nonattainment area.
The submittal pertained to the exemption from the oxides of nitrogen requirements for conformity, inspection and
maintenance, reasonably available control technology, and new source review. These are required by sections 176(c),
182(b)(4), and 182(f) of the 1990 amended Clean Air Act, respectively.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this interim rule. However, the
address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base flood elevation determinations are
available for inspection is provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any request for reconsideration must be based upon knowledge of changed conditions, or upon new scientific or technical
data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modifications are made pursuant to section 201 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR part 65. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, state or regional entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes in base flood elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4.

Regulatory Flexibility Act because modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster Protection
Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are required to maintain community eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.

permits. Where emissions within the licensee's frequency block influence the levels measured outside the block
sufficiently to show non-compliance, alternative techniques may be used provided the technique is coordinated
with the Commission.''

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 These final standards amend the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) standards issued June
17, 1986 (51 FR 22612, 29 CFR 1910.1001, June 20, 1986) for occupational exposure to asbestos in general industry,
and the construction industry, 29 CFR 1926.1101 (previously 1926.58). In addition, they include a separate standard
covering occupational exposure to asbestos in the shipyard industry, (29 CFR 1915.1001). Major revisions in these
standards include a reduced time-weighted-average permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter
(f/cc) for all asbestos work in all industries, a new classification scheme for asbestos construction and shipyard
industry work which ties mandatory work practices to work classification, a presumptive asbestos identification
requirement for ``high hazard'' asbestos containing building materials, limited notification requirements for
employers who use unlisted compliance methods in high risk asbestos abatement work, and mandatory methods of control
for brake and clutch repair. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Most of the revisions in these amended standards are the final response to an order of the Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has regulated asbestos several times as more information has become available. Asbestos rulemakings marked
the early years of the Agency. A 12 f/cc permissible exposure limit (PEL) for asbestos was included in the initial promulgation
on May 29, 1971 (36 FR 10466) of OSHA standards pursuant to Section 6(a) of the Act. In response to a petition by the Industrial
Union Department of the AFL-CIO, OSHA issued an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) on asbestos on December 7, 1971,
which established a PEL of 5 f/cc as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) and a peak exposure level of 10 f/cc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1972, OSHA promulgated a new final standard that established an 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 f/cc and a ceiling limit of
10 f/cc. These limits were intended primarily to protect employees against asbestosis, and it was hoped that they
would provide some incidental degree of protection against asbestos induced forms of cancer. Effective July 1976,
OSHA's 8-hour TWA limit was reduced to 2 f/cc and this limit remained in effect up to the effective date of the revised
1986 standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1975, OSHA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (40 FR 47652) to revise the asbestos standard because
the Agency believed that ``sufficient medical and scientific evidence has been accumulated to warrant the designation
of asbestos as a human carcinogen'' and that advances in monitoring and protective technology made re-examination
of the standard ``desirable.'' This proposal would have reduced the 8-hour TWA to 0.5 f/cc and imposed a ceiling limit
of 5 f/cc for 15 minutes. The 1975 proposal would have applied to all industries except construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At that time no separate proposal applicable to the construction industry was developed by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 24, 1983 OSHA consulted with the Advisory Committee for Construction Safety and Health (``ACCSH'') concerning
the applicability of any new asbestos standard to the construction industry. ACCSH endorsed OSHA's position that
any new PEL adopted for general industry should also apply to the construction industry (Ex. 84&hyph;424). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 4, 1983 OSHA published an ETS for asbestos (48 FR 51096). The ETS marked a new regulatory initiative, related
to, but not part of the 1975 proceeding. The ETS was held invalid by the U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
on March 7, 1984. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, OSHA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (49 FR 1416, April 10, 1984) for a standard covering
occupational exposure to asbestos in all work places subject to the Act. Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act, the ETS
also served as a proposed rule. On June 17, 1986, OSHA issued two revised standards, one governing occupational exposure
to asbestos in general industry workplaces, the other applicable to construction workplaces (51 FR 22612 et seq.,
June 20, 1986). Effective July 21, 1986, the revised standards amended OSHA's previous asbestos standard issued
in 1972. The 1986 standards explicitly applied to occupational exposure to non-asbestiform tremolite, anthophyllite
and actinolite. After a subsequent and separate rulemaking proceeding OSHA has deleted these minerals from the scope
of the asbestos standards. (57 FR 24310, June 8, 1992).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The separate comprehensive asbestos standards for general industry and construction which were issued in 1986 shared
the same permissible exposure limit (PEL) and most ancillary requirements. Both standards reduced the 8-hour time
weighted average (TWA) PEL tenfold to 0.2 f/cc from the previous 2 f/cc limit. Specific provisions were added in the
construction standard to cover unique hazards relating to asbestos abatement and demolition jobs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several major participants in the rulemaking proceeding including the AFL&hyph;CIO, the Building and Construction
Trades Department (BCTD) of the AFL&hyph;CIO, and the Asbestos Information Association (AIA), challenged various
provisions of the revised standards. On February 2, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued
its decision upholding most major challenged provisions, but remanding certain issues to OSHA for reconsideration

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(BCTD, AFL&hyph;CIO

, 838 F.2d 1258). The Court determined that OSHA had not adequately explained why it was not adopting certain recommended
provisions in light of evidence suggesting that those provisions would be feasible to implement and would provide
more than a de minimis benefit for worker health. The Court also ordered OSHA to clarify the regulatory text for two
provisions and found one provision, a ban of spraying asbestos-containing products, unsupported by the record.
In addition, OSHA's failure to adopt a short-term exposure limit (STEL) was ordered to be reconsidered within 60 days
of the Court's mandate. In partial response, OSHA issued a STEL of 1 f/cc measured over a 30-minute sampling period,
on September 14, 1988 (53 FR 35610). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to additional petitions by BCTD and the AFL&hyph;CIO, the Court, in an October 30, 1989 order, divided
the remand issues into three categories as follows. With respect to three issues, the Court ordered OSHA to take action
by December 14, 1989. These issues were:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Issue 1. formally delete the ban on the spraying of asbestos-containing materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 2. clarify that periodic monitoring in the construction industry must be resumed after conditions change;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 3. Clarify the exemption for ``small-scale, short duration operations'' from the negative-pressure enclosure
requirements of the construction standard to limit the exemption to work operations where it is impractical to construct
an enclosure because of the configuration of the work environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA issued its response on these issues on December 14, 1989 (54 FR 52024, December 20, 1989). In that document OSHA
(1) removed the ban on the spraying of asbestos-containing materials; (2) changed the regulatory text to clarify
that construction employers must resume periodic monitoring whenever there has been a change in process, control
equipment, personnel or work practices that may result in new or additional asbestos exposure; and (3) explained
why OSHA was not amending the regulatory text to clarify the limited exemption for ``small-scale, short-duration
operations'' in the construction industry standard, but instead would institute rulemaking on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the second group of issues, the Court ordered OSHA to complete its response on the existing record by
January 28, 1990. These issues are:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Issue 4. The possibility of further regulations governing employee smoking controls; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 5. The effectiveness levels of various respirators and OSHA's policy of requiring respirators to protect workers
at only PEL level; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 6. The possibility of bi-lingual warnings and labels for employers with a significant number of non-English-speaking
employees.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Court stated that if OSHA determines that these issues could not be resolved on the existing record, OSHA may explain
why and commence new rulemaking instead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 28, 1990, OSHA issued its response on these issues (55 FR 3724, February 5, 1990). In that document, OSHA:
(1) prohibited workplace smoking in areas where occupational exposure to asbestos takes place; expanded training
requirements to include information about available smoking cessation programs; required the distribution of
self-help smoking cessation material; and, required a written opinion by the physician stating that the employee
has been advised of the combined dangers of smoking and working with asbestos; (2) explained how and why the 1986 respiratory
protection standards will reduce employee risk below that remaining solely as a result of the PEL, and that the effectiveness
levels of respirators are under review; and (3) required employers to ensure that employees working in or near regulated
areas understand warning signs, and required training programs to specifically instruct employees as to the content
and presence of signs and labels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, as to the third group of three remaining remand issues, the Court ordered OSHA to resolve these issues after
rulemaking. These issues are:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Issue 7. The establishment of operation-specific permissible exposure limits; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 8. The extension of reporting and information transfer requirements; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 9. The expansion of the competent person requirement to all employers engaged in any kind of construction work.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Court granted OSHA's unopposed request to publish the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on this group
of issues on April 13, 1990, to allow sufficient time to consult with the Advisory Committee on Construction Safety
and Health (ACCSH). Under the Construction Safety Act (40 USC 333) and regulations in 29 CFR 1911.10 and 29 CFR 1912.3,
OSHA was required to consult with that committee in the formulation of regulatory proposals which would apply to employment
in construction. OSHA presented the proposed regulatory text and pertinent explanatory materials to the ACCSH and
consulted with them on March 14, 1990. The Committee submitted comments and suggestions which were discussed in the
proposal. The Court, on May 2, 1990 granted OSHA's further motion and extended the time to issue the proposal until
July 12, 1990, in order to allow coordination of the proposal with other regulatory agencies, in particular EPA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revisions were published July 20, 1990 (55 FR 29712). The date for close of the public comment period in
the NPRM was September 25, 1990 with the public hearing scheduled to commence October 23, 1990. However, several interested
parties requested additional time for comment on the NPRM due to the breadth of issues it presented. OSHA felt the objective
of developing a complete rulemaking record would be served and extended the period for submission of public comments
and for notices to appear at the informal hearing until December 3, 1990. The Agency also rescheduled the informal
hearing to begin January 23, 1991. In the notice extending the time periods, OSHA also explained more clearly that
the ACCSH report referenced in the NPRM was submitted by the labor representatives on that committee and not by the
committee as a whole (55 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FR
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 p. 38703, September 20, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The informal hearing was held for 13 days from January 23 to February 8, 1991. At the close of the hearing Administrative
Law Judge Sheldon Lipson set April 12, 1991 as the close of the post-hearing comment period and June 12, 1991 as the close
of the post-hearing briefing period. Subsequently on request, Judge Lipson extended these periods to April 26 and
June 26 respectively. BCTD requested OSHA extend the post-hearing briefing period 4 weeks to allow additional time
to fully address all issues of concern due to the extent and complexity of the records. OSHA granted this request and
notified participants that the post-hearing briefing period was extended to July 24, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 3, 1992, by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, OSHA re-opened the comment period to allow supplementary public comment on options to protect workers from
inadvertent exposure to asbestos in buildings (57 FR 49697). This issue, not part of the Court's remand order, was
broached by the Agency in the preamble to the proposal, and had been the subject of litigation brought by Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) against EPA. In 1988 the Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO petitioned
the Environmental Protection Agency for regulation of asbestos in public and commercial buildings and subsequently
sued the Agency. This resulted in the convening of a series of ``Policy Dialogue'' meetings established by EPA in an
attempt to reach agreement on issues concerning asbestos in public and commercial buildings. As discussed in the
NPRM of July 20, 1990, OSHA and a variety of other interested parties participated in the meetings which took place
between May 1989 and May 1990. These groups included realty interests, lenders and insurance interests, unions,
asbestos manufacturers, public interest groups, asbestos consultants and contractors and states. The group failed
to agree on all issues, but did generally agree that the presence of asbestos should be known to building service workers.
The major area of disagreement in the group dealt with the characterization of risk to general building occupants
and office workers. The group also did not agree on the need for specific federal asbestos inspection requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SEIU and other unions also participated in this rulemaking and urged OSHA to issue a building inspection rule. After
discussions with EPA and review of the record concerning how best to protect employees against unknowing exposure
the Agency published a request for comment on a regulatory approach to protect building service workers. The approach
would require certain high-risk materials in accessible building/facility areas be designated presumptive asbestos
containing materials and thus be treated as if they contained asbestos, until or unless the presumption was rebutted
through sampling or specific information in the owner's possession relation to construction specifications. The
notice also asked for comments on the Health Effects Institute (HEI) report which had been submitted to the record
after the close of the post-hearing briefing periods. The notice resulted in submission of an additional 60 sets of
comments, and the comment period closed on January 4, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record of this rulemaking consists of over 55,000 pages. OSHA has worked closely with EPA so that the regulations
of both agencies are compatible to the extent OSHA's mandate allows.

Authority for issuance of this standard is found primarily in sections 6(b), 8(c), and 8(g)(2) of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the Act), 29 U.S.C. 655(b), 657(c), and 657(g)(2) and in the Construction Safety Act,
40 U.S.C. 333. Section 6(b)(5) governs the issuance of occupational safety and health standards dealing with toxic
materials or harmful physical agents. Section 3(8) of the Act defines an occupational safety and health standard
as:

The ``significant risk'' determination constitutes a finding that, absent the change in practices mandated by the
standard, the workplaces in question would be ``unsafe'' in the sense that workers would be threatened with a significant
risk of harm.

 at 642. A significant risk finding, however, does not require mathematical precision or anything approaching scientific
certainty if the ``best available evidence'' does not warrant that degree of proof.

 at 655&hyph;656; 29 U.S. 655 (b)(5). Rather, the Agency may base its finding largely on policy considerations and
has considerable leeway with the kinds of assumptions it applies in interpreting the data supporting it,

 655&hyph;656; 29 U.S. 655(b)(5). The Court's opinion indicates that risk assessments, which may involve mathematical
estimates with some inherent uncertainties, are a means of demonstrating the existence of significant risk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The court further stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Agency's responsibility to determine in the first instance what it considers to be a ``significant'' risk.
Some risks are plainly acceptable and others are plainly unacceptable. If, for example, the odds are one in a billion
that a person will die from cancer by taking a drink of chlorinated water, the risk clearly could not be considered significant.
On the other hand, if the odds are one in a thousand that regular inhalation of gasoline vapors that are 2% benzene will
be fatal a reasonable person might well consider the risk significant and take the appropriate steps to decrease or
eliminate it. (I.U.D. v A.P.I., 448 U.S. et 655). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has always considered that a working lifetime risk of death of over 1 per 1000 from occupational causes is significant.
This has been consistently upheld by the courts. See the recent discussion in the cadmium preamble 57 FR 42102, 42204
and the earlier asbestos preambles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that compliance with these final amendments to reduce the PEL to 0.1 f/cc as a time-weighted average
measured over 8 hours will further reduce a significant health risk which existed after imposing a 0.2 f/cc PEL. OSHA's
risk assessment accompanying the 1986 standard, showed that lowering the TWA PEL from 2 f/cc to 0.2 f/cc reduces the
asbestos cancer mortality risk from lifetime exposure from 64 deaths per 1,000 workers to 7 deaths per 1,000 workers.
OSHA estimated that the incidence of asbestosis would be 5 cases per 1,000 workers exposed for a working lifetime under
the TWA PEL of 0.2 f/cc. Counterpart risk figures for 20 years of exposure are excess cancer risks of 4.5 per 1,000 workers
and an estimated asbestosis incidence of 2 cases per 1,000 workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's risk assessment also showed that reducing exposures to 0.1 f/cc would reduce excess cancer risk to 3.4 per 1,000
workers and a 20 year exposure risk to 2.3 per 1,000 workers. OSHA concludes therefore that reducing the exposure limit
to 0.1 f/cc will further reduce significant risk.

OSHA's current estimates of employee exposure in the various operations covered by these standards are referenced
in the Regulatory Impact Analysis found later in this document. Additional exposure estimates, based on record evidence
are referenced throughout this document in the relevant preamble discussion concerning each operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Court of Appeals litigation, AIA challenged OSHA's use of the PEL to calculate the residual risk remaining after
the standard is implemented. AIA contended that workers would actually be exposed to average levels significantly
below the PEL because employers would be required to engineer down to levels well below the PEL to assure that random
fluctuations would not result in an OSHA compliance officer measuring an exposure level over the PEL during a routine
inspection. Therefore, AIA contended, in calculating residual risk, OSHA should assume that employees will be exposed
to average levels that are between one-half and one-quarter of the PEL. The Court implied that such an argument might
have merit if factually supported and suggested that OSHA should make its own calculations of the relation between
permissible exposure limit and the actual exposures such a limit would produce. (838 F.2d at 1266) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having carefully considered the issue, OSHA concludes it would be unrealistic to base its risk assessment on the assumption
that employers will engineer to levels significantly below the PEL. First, as discussed below, the PEL of 0.1 f/cc
is at the limit of feasibility for those workplaces in which asbestos levels are most difficult to control, and an assumption
that average exposures will be substantially below the PEL will clearly be unrealistic for such workplaces. Second,
OSHA found in issuing the 1986 standard that AIA's argument about uncontrollable fluctuations was exaggerated because
such fluctuations could be minimized through proper inspection and maintenance of engineering controls and through
proper training and supervision of employees whose work practices affected exposure levels. (51 FR at 22653). Third,
OSHA's enforcement policy gives employers the opportunity to show that a compliance officer's measurement over
the PEL is unrepresentatively high and does not justify a citation, thus alleviating any concern employers might
have that they will be cited on the basis of a single measurement that results from uncontrollable fluctuations. Fourth,
even if some employers are sufficiently risk-averse to engineer down to well below the PEL to avoid a slight risk of
citation, OSHA cannot base a realistic risk assessment on the assumption that most employers will do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 0.1 f/cc level leaves a remaining significant risk. However as discussed below, and in earlier documents, OSHA
believes this is the practical lower limit of feasibility for measuring asbestos levels reliably. However the work
practices and engineering controls specified below for specific operations and required respirator use will in
OSHA's view further reduce the risk. As discussed below, OSHA has carefully reviewed all the public suggestions to
further reduce significant risk and has adopted those which have merit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After OSHA has determined that a significant risk exists and that such risk can be reduced or eliminated by the proposed
standard, it must set the standard ``which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible on the basis of the best
available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health*&blank;*&blank;*,'' Section 6(b)(5)
of the Act. The Supreme Court has interpreted this section to mean that OSHA must enact the most protective standard
necessary to eliminate a significant risk of material health impairment, subject to the constraints of technological
and economic feasibility.

Authority to issue this standard is also found in section 8(c) of the Act. In general, this section gives the Secretary
authority to require employers to make, keep, and preserve records regarding activities related to the Act. In particular,
section 8(c)(3) gives the Secretary authority to require employers to ``maintain accurate records of employee exposures
to potentially toxic materials or harmful physical agents which are required to be monitored or measured under section
6.'' Provisions of OSHA standards which require the making and maintenance of records of medical examinations, exposure
monitoring, and the like are issued pursuant to section 8(c) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the revisions to the asbestos standards are reasonably related to these statutory goals, the Secretary finds
that these standards are necessary and appropriate to carry out is responsibilities under the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted above, this rulemaking proceeding is a response to a remand order of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
The Court determined that in the earlier 1986 rulemaking, OSHA had not sufficiently explained its decisions not to
adopt certain regulatory provisions recommended by participants in that rulemaking. In particular, the Court of
Appeals held that it is OSHA's ``duty to keep adding measures so long as they afford benefit and are feasible, up to the
point where (it) no longer finds significant risk,'' and that it is OSHA's duty to consider the reasonableness of adopting
them. 838 F.2d at 1269. The Court noted that OSHA need not justify its failure to adopt all suggested provisions: rather,
the Agency must defend not adopting only those provisions demonstrated by their advocates, ``to be feasible to implement
and will provide more than a de minimis benefit for worker health.'' The Court further explained, ``(n)aturally the
force of the evidence and argument that OSHA must offer to defend its choice will vary with the force of the proponent's
evidence and argument.'' Id at 1271.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this final rule, based upon the record evidence, OSHA is adopting certain regulatory recommendations made in the
earlier rulemaking, is rejecting other recommendations, and is issuing other provisions which are based on, but
are altered versions of yet other recommendations in the earlier rulemaking. In addition, new, different and expanded
provisions also have been urged for adoption by participants in this rulemaking. These participants represent labor,
public interest and industry interests. The Agency is adopting, rejecting and changing these recommendations as
well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A large portion of this preamble is devoted to the Agency's explanations of these regulatory decisions. OSHA believes
that its reasons when it has adopted or has not adopted recommended provisions are well supported by the evidence and
that the reasons for its choices are stronger than the contrary arguments. In general, OSHA believes that the extent
of its burden to refute claims of benefit for a recommended provision depends on the extent of the supporting data.
If the data are valid and extensive, OSHA's burden is greater. If however, the claim of benefit is based on opinion,
refutation by OSHA need not be grounded in data, but may be based on OSHA's well reasoned and expert contrary opinion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, OSHA's decision not to adopt recommended provisions to reduce asbestos related risk reflects the Agency's
expert judgment, often where available data creates considerable uncertainty, that the provisions would not offer
more than de minimis benefit in reducing a still significant risk. Many recommendations were unsupported by data
showing benefit. For example, it was recommended to prohibit high speed burnishing of asbestos-containing floor
tile. However, the data do not show a measurable reduction of airborne asbestos fiber levels, based on actual fiber
counts using such practices. Other recommended provisions simply do not reduce a still significant risk. For example,
requiring very low clearance samples (analyzed by transmission electron microscopy) to deregulate all ``regulated
areas'' to assure that EPA/AHERA level of 0.01 f/cc is met does not appear to be necessary to reduce a significant risk
to employees. There is an extremely low (although speculative) risk of asbestos related disease estimated at such
clearance levels, and, there is evidence that immediate clearance sampling does not predict later concentration
levels.

Relationship to Indoor Air Quality Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 5, 1994 at 59 FR 15968, OSHA proposed a new standard for indoor air quality. The proposed regulation included
a clause making brief reference to asbestos. See Paragraph (d)(8) at page 16036. That reference was unintended as
OSHA, intends to cover all asbestos issues in the final asbestos rule where full consideration has been given to them.
OSHA will not create new requirements in a final Indoor Air Quality Standard that are specifically designed to control
asbestos exposures, and will announce that it is withdrawing the asbestos clause in paragraph (d)(8) at the commencement
of the indoor air hearing. Accordingly there is no need for parties to submit asbestos-related materials into the
Indoor Air record.

III. Summary and Explanation of Revised Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final standards constitute OSHA's response to the remaining issues raised for the Agency's reconsideration
by the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The specific issues raised by the Court are: the establishment
of operation-specific permissible exposure limits; the extension of reporting and information transfer requirements;
the expansion of the competent person requirement to all employers engaged in any kind of construction work; and,
the clarification of the small scale, short duration operation exemption from the requirement to establish a negative-pressure
enclosure. For convenience OSHA is summarizing here its response to each of these issues. They are discussed in depth
below. Also discussed below are the other changes OSHA has made which are not in direct response to the remand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Issue 7. Establishment of Operation Specific Exposure Limits: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The court remand causes OSHA to consider establishing operation-specific permissible exposure limits to the extent
feasible, as needed to eliminate significant risk of illnesses caused by asbestos exposure. OSHA proposed to decrease
the PEL to a uniform 0.1 f/cc. OSHA believes that this limit is feasible for most industry sectors to reach most of the
time (55 FR 29720). However, OSHA explained that PELs lower than 0.1 f/cc are difficult to reliably measure. However
OSHA has followed a more effective approach to lowering exposures for those sections and operations where lower exposures
can be achieved. This approach is triggering protective provisions based on the kind of operation undertaken, rather
than measured exposure levels. This approach is consistent with some other health standards (e.g., lead, coke ovens).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A major reason for this approach for construction and shipyards is that measured levels of exposure often fail to define
risk and are often not received before the work is completed. This was partly explained in the proposal. There OSHA
noted that for removal jobs, highly variable amounts of asbestos are generated, ``reducing the predictability of
exposure levels from one monitoring event to the next. Moreover, measured asbestos levels often cannot be used to
determine the need for (specific controls) .&blank;.&blank;. because of the time required by the laboratory to complete
the test and report the results.'' (55 FR at 29715&hyph;16). Thus, it would be unproductive to leave employees unprotected
while initial monitoring results are being analyzed; and in many cases, even prompt reporting of exposure levels
during the setting up of the controls would not predict exposures during the actual removal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A significant risk remains at the PEL of 0.1 f/cc, and it is feasible to attain lower levels for some workers exposed
to asbestos. OSHA has therefore considered whether to establish different PELs for different operations based on
the lowest exposure limits that can feasibly be achieved in those operations and that are needed to eliminate significant
risk. OSHA has decided not to do so because the operation-specific work practices mandated in the standard will be
a most cost-effective means of assuring that significant risk is eliminated to the extent feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos has been the subject of extensive rulemaking by OSHA and other agencies, and the operations that expose employees
to asbestos are well known and thoroughly studied. Moreover, given the shift away from asbestos products wherever
substitutes are available, it appears unlikely that major new uses will be found for asbestos in the future. OSHA has
therefore been able to focus its rulemaking effort on evaluating the work practices that will best reduce asbestos
exposures in the specific operations that expose workers to asbestos. The result is a standard that relies heavily
on mandated work practices that will, in most situations, result in employee exposure well below the PEL. In effect,
the mandated work practices will assure that each asbestos worker is exposed to the lowest feasible level for the operation
in which that worker is engaged. This approach was taken in the 1986 construction standard. There, OSHA ``tiered''
its construction standard ``to apply increasingly stringent requirements to those work operations associated
with the highest exposures.'' (51 FR at 23706). Rather than two classifications as in 1986 (small-scale and abatement
work), OSHA now divides construction work into four classes and has made additional limited distinctions based on
measurable variables such as amount of material disturbed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since OSHA's approach assures that each employee is exposed to the lowest feasible level of asbestos, no additional
protection would be gained by establishing a series of different PELs for different operations. Such an approach
would add cost and complexity to employers' compliance duties and to OSHA's enforcement duties without benefiting
worker health. PELs lower than 0.1 f/cc would be particularly unsuitable as compliance criteria because it is difficult
to reliably measure lower levels. Because such measurements are unreliable, if lower PELs were established, measurements
taken by employers and by OSHA would provide an uncertain basis for determining whether employers have fulfilled
their compliance duties. However, both employers and OSHA can easily determine whether the work practices prescribed
in the standard are being followed. The mandated work practices thus assure that employees are better protected than
a series of different PELs while reducing compliance burdens on employers and easing the agency's enforcement burden.
Therefore, rather than set operation-specific permissible exposure limits, OSHA proposed to further reduce risk
by requiring certain additional work practices. The operations for which mandatory work practices are required
would otherwise result in employee exposure that is significant. OSHA believes that these controls are feasible,
reasonable, and necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA also proposed, in the general industry standard, to link the dates when engineering controls would be required
to reach the new lower PEL with the EPA Ban and Phase-out Rule. This linkage is no longer an option since the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals recently vacated the ban and it is not yet clear which asbestos-containing products will no longer
remain in commerce, and staged phase-outs of asbestos containing products are not required.

Issue 3. Small Scale Short Duration Definition: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Court asked that OSHA clarify the exemption for ``small scale, short duration operations'' from the negative-pressure
enclosure (NPE) requirements of the construction standard. The negative pressure enclosure requirements are a
substantial set of requirements. They include creating a system of regulated areas with a sealed work area under negative
pressure, decontamination facilities and procedures, clean room facilities and procedures and shower facilities,
and other practices to reduce worker exposure and spread of contamination outside the work area. In that standard,
NPEs were required for all removal, demolition and renovation work except for small scale short duration operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court suggested, based on its view of the Agency's earlier intent, that OSHA limit the exemption to work operations
where it is impractical to construct an enclosure because of the configuration of the work environment. In an earlier
response to the remand order, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 52024, December 20, 1989), OSHA declined to amend the regulatory text on the small-scale, short duration issue,
without conducting supplemental notice and comment rulemaking. The Agency explained ``that explicitly limiting
the exemption to situations where negative pressure enclosures are impractical might not reduce employee risk from
asbestos exposure.'' (54 FR at 52026). OSHA stated that in the supplemental rulemaking, it intended ``to discuss
the effectiveness and drawbacks of negative-pressure enclosure, glove bags, and alternative control systems;
and to specify more clearly under what circumstances various control systems may be used.'' (54 FR at 5207). OSHA also
noted that the small-scale, short duration issue is related to the scope of the ``competent person'' requirement,
which the 1986 standard lifted for operations which conformed to the exception, and thus combined consideration
of both issues would be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in July l990, OSHA proposed related changes in both provisions ``small scale, short duration'' operations
would be redefined in terms of general criteria, as well as the 1986 approach of listing specific examples. However,
the underlying premise remained the same as in the 1986 standard: i.e. exemptions to the negative-pressure enclosure
requirement for removal, renovation and demolition projects and limited to jobs which conformed to specified criteria.
``Competent'' persons, according to the 1990 proposal, were to be required as supervisors on all asbestos-related
construction worksites, instead of as in the 1986 standard, that required competent persons only for non ``small-scale,
short term jobs.'' Required training for competent persons, would vary, however, depending on the kind of asbestos-
related job needing supervision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final provisions resolving these issues, are different from the proposal. Four classes of increasingly hazardous
types of construction activity are matched with increasingly stringent control requirements. Class I asbestos
work means activities involving the removal of asbestos containing material (ACM) and presumed asbestos containing
material (PACM) which is ``high risk.'' Class II asbestos work means activities involving the removal of ACM and PACM
which is not ``high risk.'' Class III asbestos work means activities involving repair and maintenance where ACM and
PACM is disturbed. Class IV asbestos work means maintenance and custodial activities during which employees contact
ACM and PACM and activities to clean up waste and debris containing ACM and PACM. Each class includes work with similar
exposure levels and with similar exposure risks. Each has a prescribed set of controls and work practices. Basically
only Class I work, high-risk activities, require negative-pressure enclosures. The standard allows other designated
proven control systems in limited circumstances and provides for yet-to-be-developed systems if certain backstop
provisions are met. As indicated in its earlier responses to the Court, and its public notices of proposed rulemaking,
OSHA has evaluated available control technologies and has concluded that the use of negative-pressure control enclosures
should be regulated in terms of when they are required rather than when they are not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a major departure from the language of both the 1986 standard and the proposal, OSHA is deleting the term ``small
scale, short duration'' from the regulatory text. Instead, the agency is distinguishing high- from lower-risk operations
through the use of the classification system described above. Work that was exempted from the negative pressure enclosure
requirements in the existing standard because it was of ``small-scale, short-duration'' are considered to be Class
II and Class III work in this amendment. The agency finds that the term ``small-scale, short term'' is too limiting,
is confusing, and cannot be defined with sufficient precision to serve the purpose of distinguishing high risk asbestos-disturbing
activity from activity of reduced risk.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term is limiting because it focuses on a fraction of the circumstances and criteria which define lower risk work
with asbestos-containing material. For example, removing asbestos-containing products like transite panels,
likely will not result in significant exposure, even if conducted for more than one day, if there is use of a few simple
controls. As much as the scope and duration of the job, the materials themselves, their condition and the work-practices
used define hazard potential. OSHA had tried to include these concepts under the ``small-term, short-duration''
exception in the current standard, by reference to examples. However, the breadth of the examples led the court to
observe that ``the exception as now worded seems to erase the rule.'' (838 F. 2d at 1279). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1990 proposal OSHA tried to identify the conditions and operations which separated higher risk work with ACM
from lower risk work in its small-scale, short-term definition. Still anchoring the distinction however, was OSHA's
belief that the time a job took, and the amount of material involved, primarily determined risk. Based on the record
of this proceeding, OSHA now finds that these are relevant, but not exclusive, factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA finds also that use of the term is confusing. In 1986, in its list of activities considered ``small-scale, short-term,''
OSHA listed some which are neither small-scale or short-term, but were regarded as lower risk, such as roofing work.
To cure this confusion, OSHA proposed, in 1990 to limit the ``small-scale, short duration'' exemption to a subset
of renovation, removal and demolition operations which took less time, and/or involved small areas. Even for these
activities a temporal or volume cutoff was difficult to define, and the proposed definition contained numerical
criteria, which varied depending on which activity was defined. In addition, it proposed to exempt other activities,
such as roofing, regardless of the size of the project, from the negative-pressure enclosure requirement. EPA uses
the term ``small-scale, short-duration'' to describe cut-offs which are much higher than those proposed by OSHA
for its reporting requirements for asbestos renovation, demolition and removal work under NESHAPS. And under EPA's
worker protection rule which applied to state and local government workers in OSHA non-state plan states, reporting
requirements for asbestos ``abatement'' projects, do not apply to projects involving ``less than 3 linear feet or
3 square feet of friable asbestos material.'' (40 CFR 763.124). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many objections to the proposed definition were received by the Agency. After reviewing this record, and in light
of the variety of interpretations of the term ``small-scale, short-duration,'' OSHA determined that it is inappropriate
to use that term as the equivalent of lower risk activities. Once OSHA decided to include other control methods in the
``preferred category'' for high risk asbestos work, neither a ``small-scale, short-duration'' definition nor
an exemption from negative- pressure enclosure requirement was central to OSHA's regulatory scheme. As explained
more fully below, although OSHA no longer uses the term ``small_scale, short-term'' to exempt activities from universal
requirements, OSHA uses the related terms ``small-scale'' and ``reduced exposure potential'' as part of a larger
classification scheme.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OSHA had proposed expanded notification and reporting provisions in response to the Court's remand order concerning
two issues. The first is whether OSHA should require employers to give the Agency advance notification of asbestos-related
jobs. BCTD, in the 1984 rulemaking had suggested that OSHA should require all construction industry employers to
file reports concerning any building demolition, renovation or removal project involving asbestos prior to beginning
such a project. Two health enhancing benefits of a notice requirement were advanced by BCTD. One, is the help such information
would provide the Agency in targeting inspections. The other is a claimed reduction in risk because of the consciousness-raising
and self-education provided by the notice process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court noted that the BCTD proposal would ``arguably generate better information for ``selecting targets for
inspection and that it was based on ``uncontradicted (and unanalyzed) evidence of non-de minimis benefits.'' (relating
to compliance enhancement). (838 F.2d at 1278). It remanded the issue to the Agency for further explanation or rebuttal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OSHA responded in 1990, by proposing a new provision to require employers to notify OSHA in writing prior to engaging
in demolition, renovation, and removal operations which are not small-scale, short-term operations. OSHA's proposed
notice requirement shared many core elements with EPA's then current and proposed notification requirements under
NESHAPS. OSHA noted that ``(t)he proposed notification is modeled after the notification requirement concerning
asbestos abatement projects that occur in conjunction with building demolition and renovation operations. OSHA
noted further that ``(e)mployers can satisfy the OSHA (proposed) notification requirement simply by forwarding
a copy of the EPA form to the OSHA area office when complying with EPA's asbestos NESHAP.'' (55 FR at 29731). Both EPA's
and OSHA's proposed, notification requirements would exempt less extensive operations. In OSHA's case, the exemption
would have applied to small-scale, short-duration operations as otherwise defined in the standard. EPA's cutoffs
are annual amounts: 260 linear feet on pipes and 160 square feet on other facility components. OSHA noted that many
asbestos jobs would meet the notification requirements of both agencies, however there would be an indeterminate,
yet significant number for which EPA notification would not be called for, but OSHA's proposed requirement would
apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most public comment opposed the requirement. The major objection was the burden on the employer from completing and
mailing the notification form. Further, some commenters questioned the overall usefulness of the notification
requirement in promoting compliance (See comments of Shipbuilder's Council of America Ex. 7&hyph;2.) BCTD continued
to argue for extensive reporting requirements for the reasons stated above. A few other commenters supported its
position. (Ex. 7&hyph;5, 7&hyph;6, 7&hyph;34, 7&hyph;64, 7&hyph;95, 7&hyph;118, 7&hyph;132, 7&hyph;149, 141,
144).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has carefully reviewed all the comments. Based on the review and subsequent developments, the final regulation
scales down OSHA's proposed notice requirements. OSHA is now requiring advance notification of Class I (mainly large-scale
removals) only when the employer intends to utilize controls other than a negative pressure enclosure which meets
the requirements of paragraph (g) of this standard, and in some circumstances, where modifications of glove bag systems,
glove box systems and other control systems described in paragraph (g) are made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a number of reasons for OSHA's decisions. OSHA believes that the potential benefits in direct risk reduction
from a separate OSHA reporting requirement are unlikely. There are already extensive EPA and state reporting requirements
which OSHA requirements would partly duplicate. The EPA and state requirements already create any incentive to comply
that such reports could create. Similar OSHA reports would not increase this benefit. Information which may be useful
to OSHA in targeting inspections can be retrieved by information-sharing with the EPA while avoiding overlapping
reports. OSHA notes that the Paperwork Reduction Act requires that federal agencies avoid clearly duplicative reporting
requirements. Various comments challenge the value of duplicative requirements (e.g., Ex. 7&hyph;17, 7&hyph;20,
7&hyph;22, 7&hyph;28, 7&hyph;39, 7&hyph;46, 7&hyph;47, 7&hyph;50, 7&hyph;54, 7&hyph;72, 7&hyph;74, 7&hyph;76,
7&hyph;77, 7&hyph;78, 7&hyph;79, 7&hyph;81, 7&hyph;86, 7&hyph;87, 7&hyph;88, 7&hyph;89, 7&hyph;102, 7&hyph;103,
7&hyph;108, 7&hyph;112, 7&hyph;125, 7&hyph;133, 142, 147). Thus, although OSHA's and EPA's reporting requirements
are only partially duplicative, these considerations have influenced OSHA's decision not to require extensive
pre-job reporting. OSHA is concerned that in reviewing the volume of reports which may be spawned by a separate OSHA
requirement which exceeded the EPA requirements would strain OSHA area offices enforcement resources and drain
such resources from other enforcement efforts. However, OSHA finds that advance reporting is appropriate where
information is related to new or modified control methods for Class I work. In such cases, heightened attention to
the data supporting their use will result from the requirement to send them to OSHA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BCTD's contrary view that compliance would be enhanced was based in part on its contractor's report, submitted after
the 1984 hearing. The report estimated that an advance reporting requirement would reduce ``the number of workers
with TWA exposures over 0.1 f/cc'' up to 30% in drywall removal and demolition, and lesser amounts in other construction
work. These estimates were based on the opinions of a seven person ``focus group'' which included three representatives
of member unions of BCTD. No methodology was presented for deriving these quantitative estimates, and no supporting
data has been submitted in either rulemaking (see brief Ex. 143 at 198). The Court referred to the report in its decision
as uncontradicted, but that was because it was submitted late in the rulemaking procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes based on its experience that these estimates of specific quantifiable benefits are speculative.
But more importantly, the now-existing EPA and state reporting requirements and OSHA's use of that data for targeting
inspections will achieve those benefits without duplicative reporting requirements. Further, OSHA made various
changes to the final standard which will also achieve some of these benefits. These include the expanded provisions
on hazard communication, which will alert employees in all asbestos renovation, removal and maintenance work that
presumed asbestos containing material is present; that require competent persons to evaluate the work site before
work is begun, by informing employers that OSHA is setting up information sharing systems with EPA to access employer
notices sent to that Agency, and that require employers who use new and modified control systems to notify OSHA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Help for OSHA in targeting inspections from the submission of advance reports is the other claimed benefit from a reporting
requirement. Some participants claimed that because pre-job reporting was helpful to EPA in targeting its inspections
for compliance with NESHAP requirements, an OSHA pre-job reporting would similarly benefit this Agency. EPA did
not testify at the hearing, but available information shows that its reporting system provides useful information
to that Agency's enforcement program. NESHAPS reporting is made mostly to 45 state agencies, delegated by EPA to implement
the asbestos NESHAP. Reporting in EPA Region II, is directly to the Regional Office. These reports are the source of
two data bases: the National Asbestos Registry System (NARS), which develops a historical record of asbestos contractors,
updated quarterly: and the ACTS system, which is a local data base on the compliance history of each contractor. OSHA
is informed that ACTS is a tool that delegated agencies may use for day-to-day tracking of asbestos activities. EPA's
evaluation of the reports submitted to it and other information used in its NESHAP enforcement effort constitute
a valuable resource for OSHA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In 1991 both agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to share information which will aid their enforcement
efforts. Pursuant to that MOU, OSHA is developing with EPA an information sharing system based on the reports submitted
both to EPA and to various states upon delegation from EPA to access that information to help OSHA target asbestos removal
jobs. OSHA also believes that at this time some EPA delegated states, and OSHA state plan states have worked out ways
to share notifications. OSHA believes that utilizing the EPA data to assist in targeting inspections will be more
effective than duplicative reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes, based on its own enforcement experience that a limited notification requirement may enhance
compliance in specified circumstances. Employers who choose to use new or modified control technology to reduce
exposures in Class I asbestos work, must notify OSHA in advance, using EPA's NESHAP reporting form. Such information
about new and/or modified asbestos control technology submitted to OSHA by employers who wish to use it will provide
accessible information for the Agency to use to evaluate such technologies. OSHA believes that requiring employers
to routinely submit to the Agency their data in support of claims of the effectiveness of new technology will help OSHA,
employers and employees and their representatives to evaluate its effectiveness promptly.

Shipyard Employment Standard

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
One area of the proposed standard to which SESAC raised objection was the requirement that OSHA be notified 10 days
prior to initiating work on large scale asbestos operations. In addition to reiterating many of the objections to
the provision raised by others, they pointed out that often they must immediately work on ships which enter their shipyards
and turn them around quickly and that the delay caused by the notification would be overly burdensome. As OSHA explained
above, notification of OSHA is required only when Class I operations are undertaken and alternate methods of control,
other than the negative-pressure enclosure methodology, is to be employed. This provision applies both in the construction
and shipyard employment standards.

B. Notification of Other Employers and Subsequent Owners
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Court remanded the issue of whether OSHA should, as recommended by BCTD, require employers contracting asbestos-related
work to establish, maintain and transfer to building owners written records of the presence and locations of asbestos
or asbestos products, in order to facilitate identification and prevention of asbestos hazards. As noted in the 1990
remand proposal, the Court remanded this issue so that the Agency may reach ``its own judgment on the issue'' of whether
it was legally empowered to adopt such a requirement (See BCTD 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brock, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
supra at 1278). OSHA concludes that BCTD has made a persuasive case for the need to expand the notification provisions
to other employer and building owners and from them to subsequent employers with exposed employees. This is a necessary
way to informing subsequent employers that their employees are at risk of asbestos exposure and of the need to take
appropriate precautions. Requiring building owners to maintain and provide this information is by far the most effective
way of notifying employers of exposed employees who are doing work many years after the asbestos was identified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has developed an information transfer scheme concerning the presence of asbestos in buildings and structures
which may present a hazard to employees which is more comprehensive than the recommendation of BCTD. The approach
places the primary compliance burden on the building and/or facility owner, even though the employees at risk may
not be the owner's direct employees. Thus, this final standard confirms OSHA's tentative view in the proposal, that
it has authority to require building owners who are statutory employers to take necessary and appropriate remedial
action such as notifying other employers, to protect employees other than their own (see 55 FR at 29729).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed hazard communication provision limited the building owner's communication obligations to ``available''
information concerning the presence and location of asbestos. Now, in the final standard, the building owner must
communicate his knowledge of the presence and location of ACM, based on ``available'' information, and, new to the
final standard, of the presence and location of certain high risk materials, which are presumed to contain asbestos
(PACM), unless the building was constructed or renovated after 1979 or is rebutted using laboratory analysis. Further
details of this provision are spelled out later in this preamble.

Issue 9. Competent Person.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Court remanded to OSHA to determine whether employers engaged in any kind of asbestos related construction work
should be required to designate ``competent persons'' to oversee safety measures, or whether, as in the 1986 standard,
employers should only be required to designate trained ``competent persons'' for asbestos removal, demolition,
and renovations operations that are not small-scale, short duration. The court requested that OSHA either expand
the ``competent person'' requirement or provide a more persuasive explanation of its refusal to do so.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA proposed in 1990 to expand the requirement. Under the proposal, supervision of all asbestos construction worksites
by a ``competent person'' would be required; the training of a competent person would be keyed to the kind of asbestos
operation. However, the proposal left undecided whether onsite, continuous supervision of all asbestos-related
work would be required for all asbestos work. The final standard resolves these issues. A ``competent'' person, as
defined in the general construction standards, must supervise all work under the asbestos construction standard.
That person must be ``capable of identifying existing asbestos *&blank;*&blank;* hazards in the workplace, and
has the authority to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' 29 CFR 1926.58[b].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA reiterates its statement in the proposal that ``all construction site employees would benefit from the presence
of a competent person to oversee asbestos-related work'' (55 FR at 29726). However, the need for on-site supervision
varies with the hazard potential of the work undertaken. All workers performing Class I construction work must have
continuous access to an on-site supervisor, who meets the training requirements for designation as a ``competent
person'' under this standard. Supervision for Class II and III work does not always require a continuous on-site ``competent
person,'' therefore the standard requires inspections at ``sufficient'' intervals and at employee request. Supervision
of installation of asbestos containing construction materials and Class IV work must also be accomplished by complying
with the ``generic'' requirement for ``frequent and regular'' inspection [Paragraph (0)(2)].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training for ``competent persons'' can be accomplished in a number of ways and meet the standard's performance requirements.
For Class I, II and III work, the ``competent person'' must take a course such as a course under the EPA Model Accreditation
Plan for accredited contractor/supervisor, project designer or management planner course, or their equivalent
in content, duration, and criteria for success. Class IV work may be part of larger construction projects, in which
case the competent person trained to supervise the project should supervise the on-site cleanup activities which
constitute the Class IV work.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a provision-by-provision discussion of the revised asbestos standards. Thus all the provisions
in all three standards: general industry, construction and shipyard employment, relating to a topic will be discussed
under the heading for that topic. For example, under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
scope
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 heading, the scope of the general industry standard will be first discussed, then the scope of the construction standard,
and finally the scope of the shipyard employment standard. Similarly, under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
methods of compliance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 heading, the provisions in each standard relating to that topic will be discussed. Where a discussion applies to all
three or to two of the separate standards it will be so noted and will not be repeated for each standard. OSHA believes
that this format will help the public understand where and why the various standards contain different provisions
relating to the same subject matter. Further, it will avoid repetition in explanations where a common policy rationale
applies to more than one asbestos standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a). General Industry Standard. 29 CFR 1910.1001. The general industry standard covers all activities
(except agriculture), covered by the Act which are not otherwise covered by the construction asbestos standard,
29 CFR 1926.1101, and the new shipyard employment standard, 29 CFR 1915.1001. Consequently, marine terminals and
longshoring would be covered by the general industry standard if asbestos were being loaded, unloaded or stored.
The asbestos construction standard, in existence since 1986, lists activities which it covers. This includes construction
activities though they may take place at a factory or agricultural premises. The new shipyard employment standard,
likewise lists its covered activities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Formerly, the general industry standard had been considered the generic asbestos standard. However, because of
dramatic changes in the market for asbestos containing products, the standard now covers only four industry segments,
three of which are distinct from each other, and all are diminishing in volume and employee population. Brake and clutch
repair is the activity engaged in by the largest group of asbestos exposed workers, although most of them are exposed
sporadically and at low levels. Next largest is custodial workers who do not perform their duties as part of construction
activities, but clean surfaces, sweep, buff and vacuum floors and wash walls and windows in manufacturing plants
and a wide variety of public and commercial buildings. Although in the preamble to the proposal and throughout this
proceeding OSHA and most commenters had treated these workers as part of the construction work force, OSHA concludes
that pure custodial work is not a construction activity, and should be regulated under the general industry standard.
However, to avoid misinterpretation or for purposes of clarity of duties to affected parties, OSHA also is including
provisions protecting custodial workers who may unknowingly contact asbestos-containing material in the construction
and shipyard employment standards. In this way, there will be no advantage to interpreting coverage under any one
of the asbestos standards, rather than another.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary and secondary manufacture of asbestos containing products, completes the roster of identifiable general
industry sectors. Once, along with installers of asbestos-containing products, the core of the asbestos-exposed
work force, asbestos-containing product manufacturing employees are rapidly dwindling in number. OSHA expands
on this theme its on economic analysis later in this document. At the time of the proposal, EPA had prohibited, at three
stated intervals from August 1990 to August 1996, the future manufacture, importation, processing and distribution
in commerce of asbestos in almost all products (54 FR at 29460, July 12, 1989). Subsequently the ban was overturned
by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. EPA has interpreted the decision as invalidating only
those portions of the ban for products that were manufactured or imported at the time of the decision. Despite the remaining
legitimacy of manufacture and use of asbestos-containing products, the industries which make and maintain them
and the employees who are employed in those industries are declining rapidly and dramatically.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) Construction Standard. 29 CFR 1926.1101.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The construction standard covers (but is not limited to) the following activities involving asbestos: demolition,
removal, alteration, repair, maintenance, installation, clean-up, transportation, disposal, and storage. It
has been redesignated 29 CFR 1926.1101 to reflect the reorganization of health standards covering construction
made June 30, 1993 (58 FR 35076). The scope and application remain generally unchanged from the proposal and earlier
standard. However, 3 issues arose. First, new language, proposed in 1990 is retained in the final. ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;coverage
under this standard shall be based on the nature of the work operation involving asbestos exposure, not on the primary
activity of the employer.'' This point was made clearly in the preamble to the 1986 standards; however, it was not specifically
stated in the regulatory text and subsequently some confusion arose among the regulated community. Therefore, it
is included as a clarification of the intended application of the standards. Asbestos work which involves removal,
repair, maintenance or demolition is therefore explicitly regulated by the construction standard even if such work
is performed within a facility otherwise regulated under the general industry standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain commenters stated that maintenance and custodial work should not be regulated by the construction standard,
because they are not construction operations. OSHA notes that it has made a distinction between maintenance and custodial
work, that maintenance work is covered in the construction and shipyard employment standards, and that custodial
work is covered in all three standards, when it is incidental to work otherwise covered by a standard.

Naturally Occurring Asbestos in Soil:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Prior to the publication of the 1990 asbestos proposal, OSHA received submissions describing asbestos deposits
which occur as natural formations in the U.S. and that when disturbed, for example during earthmoving projects or
during mining operations, drilling, blasting or sawing operations, the asbestos in the deposit can become airborne
and expose workers to significant levels of asbestos fibers (Ex. 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;11). The Agency proposed to clarify
that such activities were covered under its asbestos construction standard and that methods of control were to be
employed to avoid worker exposure during disturbances of naturally occurring asbestos deposits. OSHA sought additional
information regarding any additional provisions it would adopt to protect workers engaged in these activities.
In the proposal, the Agency also requested any information on appropriate methods to use to determine the presence
of asbestos in soils, the effectiveness of wet and/or other methods to control worker exposures and information on
effective decontamination methods for exposed workers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were relatively few comments received on this issue. Some felt that asbestos in soil resulted in negligible
exposures and that wetting to prevent fugitive emissions during earth moving would be sufficient control (e.g.,
Ex. 7&hyph;6). Another participant said there was a lack of control technology and called for further study to determine
the extent and location of problems (Ex. 7&hyph;63). The industrial hygienists who had raised the issue of worker
exposure to naturally occurring asbestos, described the occurrence of asbestos in the soil of Fairfax County, Virginia
(Ex. 7&hyph;143). They reported that water misting during disturbance of asbestos-containing soils was effective
in controlling exposures. They recommended the use of negative pressure air purifying respirators, protective
clothing and showers to control exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA finds that the record indicates that certain construction sites in mostly well-defined areas contain deposits
of naturally occurring asbestos. In such areas, airborne asbestos during earthmoving activities may result in significant
exposures. In such cases, wetting of the excavation site, often required by local authorities, should be sufficient
to suppress measurable airborne asbestos concentrations. Information regarding the presence of asbestos in the
vicinity of construction sites may be available from state environmental agencies, the United States Geological
Survey, and the Bureau of Mines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of information which is readily available showing asbestos contamination of soil in the immediate
vicinity of a construction site, the employer is not required to take any action under this standard.

Paragraph (a) Shipyard Employment Asbestos Standard. 29 CFR 1915.1001.: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workers engaged in shipyard industry activities, i.e. shipbuilding, ship repair, and other work in shipyards, who
are exposed to asbestos have been protected by inclusion in 1986 general industry and construction standards published
in 1986. Like in other non-construction industries, OSHA intended employees working in shipyards to be protected
by the general industry standard, except for those operations which were specifically listed as covered by the construction
standard, i.e. renovation, removal, demolition and repair. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1988, OSHA convened the Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee (SESAC), comprised of members from
labor, private industry, state and federal government, and professional and trade associations. The Committee's
charter directed it ``to develop a single set of comprehensive health and safety standards for Shipyards.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1990 NPRM, OSHA sought information and comment on how best to provide equivalent protection to workers engaged
in shipyard activities. The Agency noted that although it had considered these operations to be regulated under the
general industry standard in the 1986 rulemaking, subsequent considerations led OSHA to observe that many shipyard
industry activities are construction-like in nature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, SESAC drafted alternative regulatory text which it submitted to this rulemaking docket with the recommendation
that it be adopted as a vertical asbestos standard for shipyards (29 CFR 1915, Ex. 7&hyph;77). The Committee stated:
``Maritime is neither general industry nor construction_it is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
maritime. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Additional comment and testimony on this issue was submitted during the rulemaking. For example, Charles Sledge,
Jr. of the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in his testimony stated that he did not feel that shipyard industry work meets the
definition of construction work defined in 29 CFR 1910.12 (Ex. 28). Although he preferred keeping shipyard industry
operations under the general industry asbestos standard, he recommended that OSHA apply the SESAC-recommended
standard to shipyard activities rather than the construction asbestos standard. He pointed out that most asbestos
work in shipyards takes place in fixed locations and does not have the transient nature of true construction work.
Mr. Sledge also felt that shipyards have developed ways to stay below the PEL and that any change would result in requiring
expensive alterations of facilities, and a need for additional training.

Several commentors including F. Losey of the Shipbuilders Council of America (Ex. 7&hyph;2), D. Knecht of Litton
Ingalls Shipbuilding (Ex. 7&hyph;22), and C. Klein of Newport News Shipbuilding (Ex. 7&hyph;71) encouraged OSHA
to adopt the SESAC-recommended regulatory text for shipyards (Ex. 7&hyph;2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J. Collins of Naval Operations objected to OSHA's proposal to apply the construction asbestos standard to shipyard
industry because he considered some of the provisions infeasible on vessels (Ex. 7&hyph;52). In his opinion the construction
standard requires showers be located at the entrance to the regulated area and that this was not reasonable on small
ships like submarines. Other comments, (apparently by others) in this submission expressed the view that shipyard
industry activities should be regulated under the construction standard since they are often identical to construction
work. To the same effect see Ex. 7&hyph;52.

*&blank;*&blank;* [It] agrees with OSHA that, because the manner in which maritime employees work with and are exposed
to asbestos is similar to the experience of construction employees, the provisions of the construction standard
should apply in that industry. In particular, whenever the likelihood exists that asbestos-containing materials
will be disturbed in ship repair and renovation, that activity should be conducted under a negative air apparatus.

The rulemaking process revealed that there was confusion in the shipyard industry sector as to which of the standards
applied to the various activities within the shipyard. In his testimony, the Chairman of the Shipyard Employment
Standards Committee said: ``In the case of asbestos, both 1910 and 1926 are both applied in various shipyard operations.
This is confusing to the shipyard work force who are required to follow one set of rules one day and another set the next
day.'' (Tr. 337)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the current revision of the asbestos standards, OSHA has determined that a separate vertical standard for shipyards
is appropriate. OSHA understands that many spokespeople for the shipyard industry believe that compliance with
OSHA's asbestos standards will be facilitated in shipyards if only one standard applies to those workplaces. Because
OSHA wishes to promote compliance, and because the Agency acknowledges that some shipyard conditions are unique,
OSHA is issuing a standard that will apply only to shipyard industries. It is neither less nor more rigorous than the
general industry and construction standards. How it differs from the two other asbestos standards will be discussed
under the topic heading for each substantive provision, in the preamble text which follows. The recommendations
will be discussed more fully, following a summary of the relatively small number of comments received by the Agency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most provisions in the final shipyard standard include some relevant provisions similar to the revised construction
standard. In addition OSHA has incorporated some of the specific recommendations made by the Shipyards Employment
Standards Advisory Committee discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Relatedly, the Great Lakes Carriers Associates, representing fleets on the Great Lakes, wanted assurance that asbestos
exposures of seamen aboard vessels will continue to be regulated by the Coast Guard under an existing Memorandum of
Understanding between the Coast Guard and OSHA (Ex. 7&hyph;8). OSHA does not intend to alter the agreement it has with
the Coast Guard. Rather, the maritime standard under discussion concerns shipbuilding, ship repair and ship-breaking
activities (29 CFR part 1915, Shipyards).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has deleted some definitions which appear in the 1986 standards, and has added others. Alphabetically, the changes
are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1986 standards contained an ``action level'' of 0.1 f/cc, one half the PEL of 0.2 f/cc. The action level provides
a ``trigger'' for certain duties, such as monitoring, medical surveillance and training. The Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit instructed OSHA to consider reducing the action level to 0.05 f/cc should the PEL
be reduced to 0.1 f/cc. In most single-substance air contaminant standards it has issued, OSHA has set an action level
equal to half the PEL. The action level triggers duties of monitoring, medical surveillance, and training, and assures
that workers who are not exposed at or above the PEL but who may nevertheless be exposed to levels that present a risk
to their health receive a degree of protection. The action level thus helps to reduce residual risk that may remain
at the PEL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In these standards, OSHA has taken a different approach to protecting workers exposed to levels of asbestos below
the PEL. Instead of a numerical action level, employer duties involving training and medical surveillance are triggered
by exposure to ACM or PACM or by the type of work being done. Additionally, work practices also are required regardless
of measured exposure levels. OSHA considers this approach to better protect employees than an action level, which
triggers training and medical surveillance duties based on monitoring results. OSHA's approach is particularly
appropriate for asbestos because in many cases, asbestos levels below the PEL cannot be reliably measured, and duties
tied to an action level might therefore be triggered by measurements of dubious accuracy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 1990 proposal, OSHA did not propose an action level based on its tentative conclusion that workplace asbestos
concentrations below the PEL could not be reliably and reproducibily measured (55 FR 29722). The Agency asked for
comment on the advisability of setting an action level of 0.05 f/cc, and specifically asked whether the methodology
for measuring airborne asbestos levels had advanced sufficiently to allow reliable and reproducible measurements
at that level. Evidence subsequently submitted to the rulemaking record indicated that levels as low as 0.05 f/cc
could not be consistently measured reliably. The rulemaking reinforces OSHA's tentative conclusion that workplace
asbestos levels of 0.05 f/cc cannot be measured reliably (see NIOSH Tr. 215, SESAC Tr. 345). Because employers cannot
obtain reliable and reproducible measurements of airborne asbestos levels at concentrations of 0.05 f/cc, it would
be infeasible to base training and medical surveillance requirements on worker exposure to asbestos at such a level.
OSHA therefore declines to establish an action level of 0.05 f/cc. OSHA recognizes in some circumstances the general
advantages of an action level, and if future monitoring technology is developed which would allow reliable, consistent
determinations at lower fiber levels, OSHA will reconsider whether an action level would be appropriate for the asbestos
standard and whether action under section (6)(b)(7) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act which directs OSHA
to ``make appropriate modification in the *&blank;*&blank;* requirements relating to *&blank;*&blank;* monitoring
or measuring *&blank;*&blank;* as may be warranted by experience, information, or medical or technological developments
acquired subsequent to the promulgation of the relevant standard'' is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has, however, included provisions that require training and medical surveillance of employees exposed
below the PEL. Thus, like standards that contain an action level, these standards use training and medical surveillance
to reduce the residual significant risk that remains at the PEL. The general industry standard requires that all employees
who work in areas where ACM or PACM is present be given a prescribed level of awareness training. The construction and
shipyard standards require training of all workers who install asbestos-containing products and all workers who
perform Class I, Class II, Class III, and Class IV work. These training requirements assure that all employees who
are potentially exposed to more than de minimis concentrations of asbestos can recognize conditions and activities
that can lead to asbestos exposure, know of the hazards associated with asbestos exposure, and are trained to utilize
the means prescribed by the standard to minimize their exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to medical surveillance, the construction and shipyard standards require medical surveillance of
all workers who, for a combined total of 30 days per year or more, engage in Class I, II, or III work, or who are exposed
above the PEL or excursion limit. Additionally employees who wear negative pressure respirators are provided with
medical surveillance. The general industry standard requires medical surveillance of all workers exposed above
the PEL or excursion level, with no 30-day per year limitation. In crafting these provisions, OSHA has attempted to
assure that those workers for whom medical surveillance will provide relevant information and benefit are entitled
to it. In construction and shipyard work, employees who do not engage in Class I, II, or III work are unlikely to be exposed
above 0.05 f/cc (the potential ``action level'') because the work practices mandated in the standard should result
in negligible asbestos exposure to workers who do not specifically engage in asbestos-related work. Employees who
engage in only Class IV work also should not be exposed above 0.05 f/cc because of the lower asbestos exposures associated
with such work. OSHA therefore believes that the construction and shipyard provisions target medical surveillance
where it is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general industry, the vast majority of workers who are exposed below the PEL will also be exposed below 0.05 f/cc.
The work practices mandated for brake and clutch repair, by far the largest general industry segment subject to the
standard, should result in virtually all such workers being exposed below 0.05 f/cc. Another large general industry
segment, custodial workers, will also be generally exposed below 0.05 f/cc. While some small number of workers in
both categories as well as in the manufacturing of asbestos products may be exposed between 0.05 f/cc and 0.10 f/cc
on some days, the difficulty of obtaining reliable and reproducible measurements at those levels makes it difficult
to identify those workers accurately. Therefore, if medical surveillance were triggered by exposure above 0.05
f/cc, the employees subject to such surveillance would likely be chosen on the basis of the vagaries of the monitoring
process rather than on any realistic assessment of the risk that they face. OSHA therefore concludes that it would
be infeasible, and would not reduce significant risk, to require medical surveillance for workers in general industry
exposed below the PEL or excursion limit.

NIOSH too testified that ``[i]n NIOSH's judgment, the establishment of a PEL or an action level below 0.1 fiber per
cc for most industrial or construction work sites would be difficult at this period of time'' (Tr. 215). Additional
doubt was voiced by the chairman of the Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee, ``*&blank;*&blank;*
an action level, that is 0.05 fibers per cc, is not appropriate or reasonable due to inconsistencies and non-reproducibility
with the sampling and analytical methodology'' and noted concern that shipyard environments were especially likely
to have high levels of background dust which could overload sampling devices, making determinations at that level
more difficult (Tr. 345). Other commenters supported the proposed deletion of an action level (Ex. 7&hyph;2, 7&hyph;39,
7&hyph;99,7&hyph;104, 7&hyph;120, 7&hyph;146).

In 1992 OSHA amended the definition of ``asbestos'' from the 1986 standards. The non-asbestiform varieties of the
minerals actinolite, tremolite and anthophyllite are no longer included in the definition of asbestos. In 1986 OSHA
determined that although tremolite, actinolite and anthophyllite exist in different forms, all forms of these minerals
would continue to be regulated. Following promulgation of the rule, several parties requested an administrative
stay of the standard claiming that OSHA improperly included non-asbestiform minerals. A temporary stay insofar
as the standards apply to the non-asbestos forms of tremolite, actinolite and anthophyllite was granted and the Agency
initiated rulemaking, proposing to remove these forms from the scope of the asbestos standards. Following a public
comment period and public hearing, OSHA issued its final decision to delete non-asbestiform tremolite, anthophyllite
and actinolite from the scope of the asbestos standards (57 FR 24310, June 8, 1992). The Agency, in evaluating the record,
found that ``evidence is lacking to conclude that non-asbestiform tremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite present
the same type or magnitude of health effect as asbestos,'' and that the failure to regulate them as asbestos does not
present a significant risk to employees.

Classification of Asbestos Work (Classes I&hyph;IV)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Construction and Shipyard Employment Standards, OSHA is adding definitions for four classes of activities
which trigger different provisions in the standard. Those activities presenting the greatest risk are designated
Class I work, with decreasing risk potential attaching to each successive class. The Construction and Shipyard Employment
Standards regulate Class I, II and III work; all three standards regulate Class IV work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Class I'' work is defined as activities involving the removal of thermal system insulation and sprayed-on or troweled-on
or otherwise applied surfacing ACM (asbestos-containing material) and PACM (presumed asbestos-containing material);
``Class II asbestos work'' is defined as removal of ACM or PACM which is not TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM; ``Class III
asbestos work'' is defined as repair and maintenance operations which are likely to disturb ACM, or PACM; Class IV
operations are custodial and housekeeping operations where minimal contact with ACM and/or PACM may occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class I asbestos work involves removal of surfacing materials sprayed or troweled or otherwise applied to surfaces,
and removal of thermal system insulation. Surfacing materials include, for example, decorative plaster on ceilings
or acoustical ACM on decking or fireproofing on structural members. Thermal system insulation includes, for example,
ACM applied to pipes, boilers, tanks and ducts. Based on the record, OSHA has determined that the prevalence of these
materials and their likelihood of significant fiber release when disturbed, requires rigorous control methods
which OSHA has set out in the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class II asbestos work involves removal of any other asbestos-containing material_which is not TSI or surfacing
ACM. Examples of Class II work are removal of floor or ceiling tiles, siding, roofing, transite panels. EPA refers
to these materials as ``miscellaneous ACM'' in the ``Green Book.'' (Ex. 1&hyph;183) Work practices and other control
measures to be employed in removing these materials are discussed later in this preamble under the methods of compliance
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class III asbestos work are defined as repair and maintenance activities involving intentional disturbance of ACM/PACM.
Class III is limited to incidental cutting away of small amounts (less than a single standard waste bag) of ACM/PACM,
for example, to access an electrical box for repair. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first three classes of asbestos work are intended to cover the kinds of asbestos work which under the 1986 construction
standard were designated ``asbestos removal, demolition, and renovation operations,'' including ``small-scale,
short-duration operations, such as pipe repair, valve replacement, installing electrical conduits, installing
or removing drywall, roofing, and other general building maintenance or renovation.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The classes are exclusive. For example, the stripping of 50 linear feet of thermal system insulation, which has not
been positively identified as non-asbestos containing material is Class I, for it is the removal of PACM. Repair of
a valve covered by ACM is Class III, since ``removal'' is not taking place. Removal of roofing material containing
ACM is Class II, since roofing material is not high-risk ACM. OSHA believes dividing activities by ``Classes'' will
be clearer than the prior system in the 1986 standard which prescribed different precautions for ``small scale, short
duration work,'' which it then defined by example. As noted in several places in this document this was confusing to
employers, to the Court and to OSHA itself. A more extensive discussion of the ``Class'' system of designating work
with asbestos-containing materials is contained in the discussion on ``Methods of Compliance'' provisions later
in this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class IV work is defined as maintenance and custodial activities during which employees contact ACM and PACM and activities
to clean up waste and debris containing ACM and PACM. This includes dusting surfaces, vacuuming carpets, mopping
floors, cleaning up ACM or PACM materials from thermal system insulation or surfacing ACM/PACM. Workers may contact
ACM or PACM when performing a wide variety of routine jobs that result in incidental disturbance, such as changing
a battery in a smoke detector attached to a ceiling containing ACM or PACM, polishing floors containing asbestos,
and changing a light bulb in a fixture attached to an asbestos containing ceiling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For custodial work, the Class IV characterization applies to situations where there is an indication that surfaces
are contaminated with ACM or PACM. One indication would be identification of the ACM or PACM sources of the debris or
dust; such as visibly damaged, or degraded, ACM or PACM in the vicinity. Visibly damaged, degraded, or friable ACM
or PACM are indications that surface dust could contain asbestos, and Class IV protection applies. OSHA requires
in (g)(9) that such dust or debris be assumed to be ACM or PACM. Another indication could be an analytical test to determine
whether the surface dust itself contains asbestos. Since dust of carpets may not be visible, visible dust on other
surfaces along with the presence of ACM/PACM nearby would indicate that cleaning the carpet is Class IV work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general industry standard also includes requirements for maintenance and custodial operations which mirror
Class IV requirements in the construction standard. These would apply to activities which are not traditionally
viewed as construction activities, and which, as contended by certain participants in this proceeding, may not be
covered by the Construction Safety Act (40 U.S.C. 333). As further discussed in the preamble discussion relating
to paragraph (a), Scope and Application, examples of these activities are clean-up in areas where asbestos-containing
dust or debris is present and removing light fixtures located near ``high risk'' surfacing material.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some Class IV work was covered by the earlier standards, yet the coverage was incomplete. The general industry standard
regulated housekeeping activities, and housekeeping activities were also included in the construction standard
to be covered if they were part of a construction job. Precautionary maintenance guidelines to avoid disturbing ACM
were addressed in Appendix G of the construction standard. OSHA believes that the switch from the regulated ``housekeeping''
activities to the Class IV definition is clearer and reduces loopholes. The custodial activities covered in either
event can clearly create asbestos dust and expose custodial employees to that dust. Data in the record show that custodial
activities can produce not insignificant asbestos exposure levels. Therefore, the work practices required to reduce
that dust are clearly necessary to reduce significant risk to custodial workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By establishing a Class IV, OSHA is rejecting various recommendations that some activities, potentially involving
asbestos disturbance, would result in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 risk, and as such should not be regulated (See further discussion concerning Methods of Compliance). The new definition
of Class IV work, the removal of the non-mandatory appendix, and coverage of these activities both under general industry
standard and the construction standard and shipyard employment standards clarify the standards' application to
such work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA requested comments on setting a cut-off for asbestos-containing material with minimal asbestos content. There
was overwhelming support for a 1% cutoff for ACM which would be consistent with EPA rules. The Hazard Communication
Standard labeling and training provisions require labelling of materials which contain more than 0.1% asbestos.
EPA defines asbestos containing material as: ``Any material containing more than one percent asbestos.'' (NESHAP
and Green Book p. 30). OSHA has no information to indicate what proportion of building materials fall into the category
of containing more than 0.1% and less than 1.0% asbestos. EPA has listed building materials by their asbestos content
and among those included on the list, only surfacing ACM ranged down to 1% (and up to 95%) (EPA ``Purple Book,'' Ex. 1&hyph;282).
Some participants, including NIOSH have expressed concern that even 1% may be below the accuracy level for optical
microscopic methods. (Ex. 7&hyph;145, 162&hyph;39). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among those who dealt with the issue, most supported the 1.0% cutoff, most citing its consistency with EPA (Ex. 7&hyph;5,
7&hyph;6, 7&hyph;21, 7&hyph;43, 7&hyph;51, 7&hyph;74, 7&hyph;76, 7&hyph;99, 7&hyph;106, 7&hyph;111, 7&hyph;120,
7&hyph;137, 151, 162&hyph;59, 162&hyph;29). OSHA agrees that a cutoff of 1.0% asbestos is appropriate for asbestos
containing building materials and has included this value in its definitions of ACM.

Closely Resemble
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Included in the construction and shipyard employment standards is a definition for the term ``closely resemble,''
which is the term used in the regulatory text to limit the use of historic exposure data to predict exposures. It is defined
as circumstances where ``the major workplace conditions which have contributed to the levels of historic asbestos
exposure are no more protective than in the current workplace.'' OSHA's intent is to allow data reflecting past exposures
to be used to predict current exposures only when the conditions of the earlier job were not more protective, i.e.,
employees were not better trained, work practices were not used more consistently, and no more supervision was present.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Competent Person
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has amended the definition of ``competent person'' in the construction standard and included it in the Shipyard
Employment Standard as a ``qualified person.'' The definition is based on the definition of ``competent person''
in the general construction standard, 29 CFR 1926.32(f), i.e. ``one who is capable of identifying existing asbestos
hazards in the workplace and who has the authority to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them,'' but adds
a specific training qualification. The training provisions require a competent person take a course which meets
the requirements of EPA's Model Accreditation Plan (40 CFR 763, Subpart E). OSHA believes that specific training
is needed so a ``competent person'' will have adequate knowledge to perform the competent person's responsibilities
for Class I and II work. A Class II and Class IV ``competent person'' must undergo ``Operations and Maintenance'' (O&amp;M)
training as developed by EPA. Further discussion of these issues is found later in this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised definition deletes from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
definition
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a list of duties to be performed by the competent person. Duties are more appropriately set out in other regulatory
paragraphs which are prescriptive, rather than in the ``definition'' section. In response to the court's remand,
OSHA has also expanded the scope of the competent persons's duties so that a competent person must supervise all asbestos
activities under the construction standard. As noted, these requirements are set forth in other regulatory paragraphs
which govern conditions of work in covered activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The shipyard employment standard does not use the term ``competent person,'' because that term has a unique definition
under Part 1915. OSHA has accepted SECSAC's recommendation that the term ``qualified person'' should be used to designate
a person with the same duties under the shipyard employment standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA is adding a definition for the term ``critical barriers'' whose use is required in certain asbestos operations.
These are defined as plastic sheeting or equivalent material placed over openings to the work area. These barriers
are effective when they seal all openings into a work area. Critical barriers can be other physical barriers sufficient
to prevent airborne asbestos in a work area from migrating to an adjacent area.

Disturbance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has added a definition for ``disturbance'' to all three standards to distinguish it from removal. In this definition
disturbance means any contact with ACM/PACM which releases fibers or which alters its position or arrangement. It
also includes operations which disrupt the matrix or render it friable or which generate visible debris from it. A
quantitative cutoff of disturbance is given_the amount of ACM/PACM so disturbed may not exceed the amount that can
be contained within one standard sized glove bag or waste bag. OSHA believes that certain jobs, e.g., repairing leaking
valves, often require asbestos to be cut away to gain access to a component. If the amount of asbestos so ``disturbed''
is contained in one bag, Class I precautions are not necessary.

Initial Exposure Assessment

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Initial Exposure Assessment,'' including ``Negative Initial Exposure Assessment'' are terms used in the construction
and in the shipyard standards. It means a required assessment by a ``competent person'' concerning the exposure potential
of a specific asbestos job, or series of similar asbestos jobs. A ``Negative Initial Exposure Assessment'' is such
an assessment in which it is concluded that employee exposures during the job are likely to be consistently below the
PELs. Assessments must be based on information and data which are allowed pursuant to criteria in paragraph (f). The
results of ``Initial monitoring,'' no longer required for each job, should be considered, but do not necessarily
constitute an adequate ``assessment'' if they would not represent all worst-case employee exposures during the
entire job.

Alternatives or modifications to listed control methods are allowed when the employer demonstrates that such a ``modification''
still provides equivalent worker protection. OSHA does not intend that changes in a control method which decrease
the safety margin of a material or omitting a procedure be permitted by calling it a ``modification.'' A ``modification''
means a changed or altered procedure, material which replaces a procedure, material or component of a required system.
For example, a new test proven successful in detecting leaks might be substituted for required ``smoke tests.'' Omission
of a procedure or component, or a reduction in the stringency or strength of a material or component is not considered
a ``modification'' under this section.

In all three standards, ``presumed asbestos containing material,'' ``PACM'' means thermal system insulation and
sprayed on and/or troweled or otherwise applied surfacing material in buildings constructed no later than 1980.
OSHA has found that these materials are ``high risk'' if asbestos-containing. OSHA bases this on the record, including
the HEI Report which states that ``thermal system insulation and surface treatments (fireproofing, acoustical
and decorative finishes) stand out in importance for their potential for fiber release and subsequent exposure to
[building] occupants'' (Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 4&hyph;5). Although these materials may have been installed in small
quantities after 1980, OSHA finds that their installation is unlikely after that date.

removal is incidental to the primary reason for the project, as well as where removal of ACM and/or PACM is the primary
reason for the project. Removal should be distinguished from ``disturbance'' which includes ``cutting away'' a
small amount of ACM or PACM.

``Regulated area'' is included in all three standards. All three, like the 1986 standards, require the establishment
of such an area where the employer believes that the PEL will be exceeded. Now, the construction and shipyard employment
standards add that such area must be established also where Class I, II and III activities will take place, regardless
of exposure levels. Also, the specific actions required of the employer to demarcate a regulated area are deleted
from the definition, and are placed in the appropriate prescriptive paragraph, in this case paragraph (e)(6).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c) General Industry, Construction and Shipyard Standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In all three standards, the eight hour time-weighted average permissible exposure limit is changed from an eight
hour time weighted average (TWA) of 0.2 f/cc to a TWA of 0.1 f/cc in the revised final rules. As noted in the 1990 proposal
and in the preamble discussion above, OSHA's decision to reduce the PEL across the board responds to the Court's directive
to consider whether to establish operation-specific exposure limits, since the Court noted that on the record of
the 1986 standards, it appeared feasible to reduce the PEL to 0.1 f/cc limit in many industry sectors. OSHA has rejected
``operation-specific'' PELs for the wide variety of operations that expose employees to asbestos. OSHA proposed
and these final standards adopt required operation-specific work practices, in addition to an across-the-board
PEL reduction to 0.1 f/cc. OSHA expects that the risk reduction accomplished by this two-pronged approach will be
at least as great as would operation-specific PELs. First, the required controls are found to be capable of achieving
maximum exposure reduction on an operation-by-operation basis. Second, since OSHA has found that specific work
practices are feasible, the Agency expects a higher compliance rate and thus, greater risk reduction than if practices
were not specified. Third, in operations where particular controls are specified, the PEL is a backstop; alerting
employers where additional controls are needed or closer surveillance is required; in all operations the PEL is a
measurable and comparable value, which cannot be exceeded without further action by the employer to reduce exposures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of the proposal in 1990, the question of whether the proposed PEL reduction would reduce a still significant
risk had already been given a tentative answer by the Court. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, in remanding the issue
of lowering the PEL to the Agency, noted that based on the 1984 risk assessment, the excess risk stemming from average
exposures of 0.1 f/cc ``could well be found significant.'' BCTD v. Brock, 838 F.2nd at 1266.'' (55 FR at 29714). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposal, OSHA stated that it believes ``that compliance with proposed amendments to reduce the PEL to 0.1 f/cc
as a time-weighted average measured over 8 hours would further reduce a significant health risk which exists after
imposing a 0.2 f/cc PEL'' (55 FR 29714, July 20, 1990). OSHA's 1984 risk assessment showed that lowering the TWA PEL
from 2 f/cc to 0.2 f/cc reduced the asbestos cancer mortality risk from lifetime exposure from 64 to 6.7 deaths per 1,000
workers. OSHA estimated that the incidence of asbestosis would be 5 cases per 1,000 workers exposed for a working lifetime
under the TWA PEL of 0.2 f/cc. Counterpart risk figures for 20 years of exposure are excess cancer risks of 4.5 per 1,000
workers and an estimated asbestosis incidence of 2 cases per 1,000 workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's risk assessment also showed that reducing exposure to 0.1 f/cc would further reduce, but not eliminate, significant
risk. The excess cancer risk at that level would be reduced to a lifetime risk of 3.4 per 1,000 workers and a 20 year exposure
risk of 2.3 per 1,000 workers. Consequently significant risk would be reduced substantially. However, OSHA concluded
therefore that continued exposure to asbestos at the TWA permitted level and action level would still present residual
risks to employees which are significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court did not ask and OSHA did not undertake to review its earlier risk assessment in the proposal. At the hearing
in January, 1991, Mr. Martonik, spokesperson for OSHA was asked by Mr. Hardy, representing the Safe Building Alliance
(SBA), if OSHA was planning to update the earlier risk assessment as part of this proceeding. Mr. Hardy stated that
``a number of parties have suggested to OSHA that its risk assessment from 1984, as relied on in the 1986 final rule,
is outdated'' (Tr. 30). Mr. Martonik responded that ``we will have to consider all information we receive and determine
relevance in this rulemaking after the record is closed. (Ibid). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other parties questioned OSHA's continuing reliance on the 1984 risk assessment. The Asbestos Information Association
(AIANA) testified that ``OSHA's 1984 risk assessment fails to take into account the scientific community's consensus
that chrysotile exposures hold lower risk than the Agency estimates *&blank;*&blank;* we do not believe that the
risk assessment that is six years old relies on the best available evidence.'' AIANA requested OSHA to convene experts,
as part of this hearing process ``to revise its asbestos risk assessment.'' (Tr. 530), this was the major objection
to OSHA's earlier risk assessment. Some participants voiced similar objections. (Ex. 7&hyph;88, 7&hyph;110, 7&hyph;104,
7&hyph;120, Ex. 145, 151), while others were of the opinion that chrysotile had the same potency as other forms of asbestos
(see Ex. 119 C, 1&hyph;136, 125, Att. 6, 143 Att C, 143 Att. D.).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although as noted above, the issue of the continuing validity of OSHA's earlier risk assessment was not remanded to
the Agency for reconsideration, implicit in OSHA's proposal to lower the PEL to 0.1 f/cc is OSHA's determination based
on the 1984 risk assessment, that the lower exposure limit is necessary to reduce a still significant occupational
risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a comprehensive review of the evidence submitted concerning the validity of the 1984 risk assessment, OSHA
has determined that it will continue to rely on the earlier analysis. The Agency believes that the studies used to derive
risk estimates remain valid and reliable, and that OSHA's decision to not separate fiber types for purposes of risk
analysis is neither scientifically nor regulatorily incorrect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are at least three reasons for OSHA's decision not to separate fiber types. First, OSHA believes that the evidence
in the record supports similar potency for chrysotile and amphiboles with regard to lung cancer and asbestosis. The
evidence submitted in support of the claim that chrysotile asbestos is less toxic than other asbestos fiber types
is related primarily to mesothelioma. This evidence is unpersuasive, and it provides an insufficient basis upon
which to regulate that fiber type less stringently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As OSHA explained in the preamble to the 1986 standards, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* to summarize the data on risk differential by asbestos fiber type, human epidemiological studies
have suggested that occupational exposure to amphiboles is associated with a greater risk of mesothelioma than is
exposure to chrysotile *&blank;*&blank;* No clear risk differential for lung cancer or other asbestos-related
disease has been demonstrated by epidemiological studies. Animal experiments, however, have indicated that chrysotile
is a more potent carcinogen than amphiboles when administered by inhalation or intrapleural injection *&blank;*&blank;*
(51 FR at 22628). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA agreed with the testimony of Dr. Davis, who stated that ``the evidence cannot answer *&blank;*&blank;* with
certainty *&blank;*&blank;* if ``one fiber *&blank;*&blank;* of amphibole (is) more dangerous than one fiber *&blank;*&blank;*
of chrysotile.'' (Ibid). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, as stated in the 1986 asbestos standard, even if OSHA were to accept the premise (which it does not), that chrysotile
may present a lower cancer risk than other asbestos fiber types, occupational exposure to chrysotile asbestos still
presents a significant risk of disease at the revised PEL (See 51 FR 22649, 22652). In particular, asbestosis, the
disabling and often fatal fibrosis of the deep portions of the lung, is caused by exposure to all types of asbestos.
The evidence on this is strong and no new information has been presented to contradict this. As stated above, OSHA estimated
asbestosis risks at 0.2 f/cc exposures as an unacceptably high 5 cases per 1000 workers. Thus, asbestosis risks alone
justify the regulation for chrysotile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lung cancer risks associated with chrysotile exposures are also high_6.7 lung cancer deaths per 1000 workers exposed
to 0.2 f/cc for a full working lifetime. OSHA notes that SBA's witness, Dr. K. Crump acknowledged that ``(t)here's
not a clear difference, *&blank;*&blank;* even in humans, for lung cancer *&blank;*&blank;* in terms of distinguishing
the potency of amphiboles vs. chrysotile.'' (Tr. 4220). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the record shows that employees are likely to be exposed to mixed fiber types at most construction and shipyard
industry worksites most of the time. Assigning a higher PEL to chrysotile would present the Agency and employers with
analytical difficulties in separately monitoring exposures to different fiber types. Thus, regulating different
fiber types at differing levels, would require more monitoring all the time and would produce limited benefits (51
FR 22682). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, OSHA believes that its conclusion to treat all asbestos fibers as having a similar potency in the occupational
setting remains valid. Most of the evidence submitted to the remand rulemaking duplicated evidence submitted to
the 1986 standards' record, or was cumulative to the earlier body of evidence. For example AIANA appended its 1988
submission to the EPA, consisting of numerous studies and reports. Some of these documents were considered by OSHA
in the prior rulemaking. There, OSHA had stated that the 1983 Berry and Newhouse study of friction materials manufacturing
workers which found nonsignificant increases in lung cancer mortality, was inconsistent with other studies showing
that low level asbestos exposure resulted in excess lung cancer mortality, because of the relatively short follow
up period used (51 FR 22618).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other studies involved lung burden analyses of mesothelioma victims, apparently showing that the pulmonary content
of chrysotile was within the range of the general population, whereas amphibole content was significantly elevated
compared to the general population (see e.g. Churg, Malignant Mesothelioma in British Columbia in 1982, Cancer,
2/85, 672). OSHA noted in the preamble to the 1986 rule, that there is a difference in tissue retention which would account
for the autopsy results and cited a study by Glyseth et al. (Doc. 33&hyph;C, Ex. 312) which supported that explanation.
OSHA also noted that ``the differential lung retention of various fiber types has been demonstrated in animals,''
citing a study by Wagner which found that animals exposed to chrysotile fibers developed lung cancer even though a
smaller amount of chrysotile was retained in the lung compared to similar tests with amphiboles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Weill believed that ``these differences in tissue persistence may wholly or partially explain the observations
[that exposure to amphiboles are associated with a higher prevalence of mesothelioma] in human *&blank;*&blank;*
population *&blank;*&blank;*. Non-confirmation of fiber type differences in animal experiments may be related
to the much shorter life span *&blank;*&blank;* [of experimental animals, which would not allow] the effects of varying
tissue-persistence to be expressed'' (Doc. 33&hyph;C, Ex. 99, p.18; 51 FR 22628). Therefore OSHA had reviewed and
evaluated in the earlier rulemaking a portion of the evidence submitted by proponents of differential regulation
of fiber types, and had rejected the claim that chrysotile should be regulated less stringently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some new evidence on the issue of differential risks of asbestos fiber types was submitted by both supporters and detractors
of that theory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In support of the position that chrysotile asbestos exposure is equivalent in risk to amphibole asbestos exposure,
BCTD submitted studies which indicated excess mesothelioma cases in workers exposed solely to chrysotile asbestos
(see Ex. 119 C, 1&hyph;136, 125, Att.6, 143 Att C, 143 Att. D). In support of the opposing claim that chrysotile has reduced
carcinogenic potential, AIANA and SBA submitted additional evidence. For example, AIANA submitted the World Health
Organization's 1989 working report which recommended that the exposure limit for chrysotile should be reduced to
1 f/cc or below (8 hour TWA), where it was recommended that exposure to crocidolite and amosite asbestos be prohibited
(Ex. 21 A, p. 9). In particular, two papers by Mossman, et. al, are cited as the basis for the claim that a scientific ``consensus''
believes that chrysotile carries a reduced carcinogenic risk (Ex. 1&hyph;153, 151). Thus AIANA states that ``since
OSHA issued its 1984 asbestos risk assessment, the scientific consensus that chrysotile asbestos poses lesser risks
has solidified'' (Ex. 142 at 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, OSHA notes that various participants in this rulemaking, including NIOSH and Dr. Nicholson, disputed the
existence of such a consensus. Dr. Nicholson and others including Dr. Landrigan, in a letter to Science, (Ex. 1&hyph;155),
dispute various interpretations of data in Mossman et al.'s paper, and challenge the conclusion that chrysotile
asbestos carries little cancer risk. Nicholson et al, point out that human studies show excess lung cancer risk that
is proportionate to exposure across all fiber types, and that animal tests confirm these relationships. OSHA believes
that the scientific community has not achieved ``consensus'' on these issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the studies submitted in support of the lowered risk of chrysotile asbestos, are those of Churg, and others showing
that the lung burden of mesothelioma victims is predominantly amphibole, even though high chrysotile exposure levels
were reported. As noted above, this line of argument was presented in the earlier asbestos rulemaking, and OSHA had
concluded that lung burden studies are inconclusive. Additional response to this argument is provided by Dement
who notes that ``(t)he biological significance of post-mortem lung fiber burden data has yet to be established. These
data are not useful as a predictor of disease for several reasons. Chrysotile is known to split longitudinally and
partially dissolve in the lung whereas amphiboles remain in the lungs for years without significant dissolution
*&blank;*&blank;*. Measurements of tissue fiber burdens many years after first exposure may bear no relationship
to the carcinogenic events which likely have taken place many years before clinical manifestation of cancer.'' (Ex.
1&hyph;273) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BCTD pointed out in its post-hearing brief, that ``Dr. Landrigan testified, while the observation that chrysotile
does not last as long in the lungs as other forms of asbestos is not new knowledge (Tr. 1074), there is recent evidence
that chrysotile is ``the most effective of the three major fiber types at migrating to the pleura, that it is present
in substantial amounts in pleural plaques and mesotheliomas, even in circumstances where it is not present or minimally
present in the lungs themselves'' (Tr. 1074). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also notes that the HEI report, in summing up its discussion of its literature search of studies examining
the issue of the relative potency of chrysotile in inducing mesothelioma, stated: ``(t)he evidence that chrysotile
rarely causes pleural mesothelioma is not conclusive ``*&blank;*&blank;* and concluded that the absence of mesothelioma
in one of the ``two cohorts of heavily exposed asbestos workers who worked only with chrysotile *&blank;*&blank;*
seems likely to be due at least in part to chance'' (Ex. 1&hyph;344 p. 6&hyph;23).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HEI concluded that ``the mesothelioma risk for chrysotile was an issue of disagreement; some members of the Literature
Review Panel held the view that a lower estimate should be recommended, as it would be more consistent with available
data. The crucial issues, neither of which can be resolved unequivocally, are (1) what proportion of the mesotheliomas
observed in groups such as the U.K. textile workers and the U.S. insulation workers were caused by their exposure to
crocidolite or amosite; and (2) whether the best general estimate of the ratio of mesothelioma to excess lung cancer
caused by chrysotile is provided by the Quebec miners and millers (about 1:4 or 1:5), or by the South Carolina textile
workers handling Quebec fiber (zero)'' (Ex. 1&hyph;344 p. 6&hyph;32). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, although there is some evidence linking chrysotile to a lower mesothelioma rate than some amphibole fiber types,
OSHA believes that there is insufficient evidence to show that chrysotile does not present a significant mesothelioma
risk to exposed employees. Furthermore, the major disease linked to asbestos exposure, lung cancer, occurs at the
same frequency among employees exposed to equivalent doses of chrysotile or to amphibole asbestos fiber types. Indeed,
evaluation of all of the evidence indicates that chrysotile asbestos presents a similar significant risk of lung
cancer and asbestosis as other forms of asbestos. Since these adverse health effects constitute the majority of diseases
related to asbestos exposure, OSHA is still of the opinion that chrysotile exposure should be treated the same as other
forms of asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to contentions that OSHA's risk assessment had overstated asbestos risks because it treated the risks
from all asbestos fiber types equally, other contentions were made that the earlier risk assessment may have understated
the risks from asbestos, because it ignored evidence of the incidence of pleural plaques, and other asbestos disease
which occurred in workers exposed at low levels, primarily as building custodians. The earlier risk assessment in
1984 focused on whether there was a significant risk of cancer and asbestosis at various levels of cumulative exposure.
During this hearing, various labor groups stated their position that the presence of pleural plaques in asbestos
exposed employees is not only a marker of asbestos exposure, but also an independent ``material impairment'' because
they are associated with a greater risk of lung function impairment and pleuritic pain. Pleural plaques are focal
areas of fibrous thickening of the pleura, the membrane lining the lung. Further, suggestions were made that OSHA
should reduce its PELS to correspond to these increased risks of ``material impairment'' which occurred at lower
exposure levels (see e.g., Ex. 143 at 35&hyph;37).

she conducted and found pleural plaques in 33% (N=40) of the group. Further she noted that in 21% (of the 40, or 12 individuals)
there was no known exposure to asbestos outside work as school custodian. In 18% of the group and 17 % of those with no
outside exposure to asbestos, she observed a restrictive pulmonary defect, significantly associated with duration
of employment as school custodian. Other studies described by Dr. Oliver, in the docket include: a study of 666 New
York school custodians, reporting only x-ray data (Ex. 47). For all groups of workers, the lung abnormality seen on
x-ray was associated with duration of work as custodian: a study of 1,117 insulation workers (likely to have had extensive
asbestos exposure) by Dr. Irving Selikoff, in which workers were followed for up to 27 years prospectively, in which
pleural plaques were found and which were concluded to be predictive of lung cancer mortality (Tr. 1036 and Ex. 124A):
a study, by Balmes (Ex. 124 DD, Tr. 1036, Ex. 1&hyph;374) of approximately 900 school district employees in California
were determined as likely to have been exposed to asbestos. The authors concluded, ``More than 11 percent of workers
known to have sustained exposure to ACM in school building, without history of exposure to asbestos prior to school
district employment, and with at least 10 years of employment with the district had radiographic evidence of parenchymal
asbestosis and/or asbestos-related pleural thickening'' (Ex. 1&hyph;374, p. 547). After adjusting for smoking
and age, the relative risk was 1.3 times greater for those with 10 years or more employment compared with those who had
just begun working for the school district.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the occurrence of pleural plaques which are viewed as presenting an independent material impairment
of health due to low level asbestos exposures, Dr. Oliver cited other studies which correlated low level asbestos
exposure with mesothelioma. Thus, a study by Dr. H. Anderson (Tr. 1032 and Ex. 124 EE, Ex. 1&hyph;374 using information
on mesothelioma cases from a Wisconsin Cancer Registry, analyzed 359 deaths from 1959 to 1989. Using death certificate
occupational information, the researchers hypothesized 41 as likely to have been exposed to asbestos in buildings.
For 10 (34%), no other likely source of asbestos exposure was identified. The paper concluded that ``individuals
occupationally exposed to in-place ACBM are at risk for the subsequent development of mesothelioma'' (Ex. 1&hyph;374,
p. 570). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA submitted a critique of these studies which they commissioned by Drs. H. Weill and J. Hughes (Ex. 122). They suggested
potential biases in these studies, that Dr. Oliver's study subjects were volunteers, the study had a low participation
rate, they had used a non-standard classification system, and did not adequately account for age in relating restriction
to lung function. These reviewers concluded that spirometric functional measurements were not related to the presence
of plaques and that reduced lung volume could result from other factors. Drs. Weill and Hughes also examined the other
studies, and argued that Dr. Selikoff's were ``fatally flawed'' due to the potential for development of unmeasured
changes during the 27 year period of follow-up, and that both the Anderson and Balmes studies failed to adequately
adjust for age, smoking and other direct asbestos exposures. Other reports cited by BCTD were dismissed because of
potential sources of bias.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Dr. Oliver rebutted these arguments (Ex 143, Attachment F). She argued that she had adequate controls, adequately
accounted for age and demonstrated that pleural plaques were significantly associated with both latency and duration
of work as custodian in the total group and in the group with no known other exposure, that lung restriction was significantly
associated with duration of work as a custodian, and that pleural plaques mark increased risk for lung cancer mortality.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Levin also responded to the reviewer's criticism of his studies with Dr. Selikoff (Ex. 143, Attachment G). He pointed
out that all x-rays had been read by a single reader, Dr. Selikoff, and that there is no evidence that smoking without
asbestos exposure increases appearance of the small irregular opacities in the lung seen on the x-rays in their study.
He further noted that in his study only actively working custodians were included and were therefore a ``survivor''
group and would therefore not be expected to report pulmonary dysfunction frequently. He claimed that relatively
unexposed subject groups would not be expected to have more than an upper limit of 3% pleural plaques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Anderson also responded to the Weill/Hughes comments (Ex. 143, Attachment H). He asserted that the review fails
to explain how biases would significantly increase odds ratios in the study, that misclassification often is random
and biases toward not detecting a difference between the study and control groups. He also questioned existence of
evidence that smoking without asbestos exposure causes pleural thickening or irregular opacities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review of available literature, including the studies mentioned above by the Health Effects Institute, resulted
in its the estimation that the prevalence of pleural plaques in the general population to be about 5% (Ex. 1&hyph;344,
p. A2&hyph;9). Although HEI advised caution in interpreting the existing studies due to lack of specificity and sensitivity
of methods used and couched its conclusions in cautious terms, they concluded: ``*&blank;*&blank;* there is now
persuasive evidence implicating asbestos-related pleural disease as an independent cause or indicator of functional
impairment and possibly even disability *&blank;*&blank;* On the individual level, pleural disease may be the only
indication of asbestos exposure, may explain symptoms and function impairment, and may predict future deterioration
in lung function'' (Ex. 1&hyph;344 p. A2&hyph;12). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees that health effects such as lung function impairment and pleuritic pain would be considered ``material
impairment,'' if substantial evidence supports the link to pleural plaques. OSHA concludes that the scientific
data indicate that pleural plaques are primarily associated with asbestos exposure, and that they have occurred
and still may at relatively low exposure levels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, OSHA does not believe that the data are available to permit OSHA to do a separate risk assessment for these
effects which would in a major way add to the present assessment. The risk assessment on which OSHA has based its significant
risk determinations for the 1986 and newly revised standards, calculated the incidence of mesothelioma, lung and
other cancers and asbestosis, diseases based on a substantial amount of both mortality and exposure data. The data
concerning lung function decrement and pleural plaques lack exposure information and would make quantitative risk
estimates for these health effects less precise than the data for other forms of asbestos-related disease upon which
OSHA is relying. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A separate risk assessment is also unnecessary. OSHA believes that the revised regulations are already regulating
at the margin of what is feasible, in terms of levels to be achieved, and controls which are required. OSHA has imposed
necessary, feasible and well supported work practices for custodial work, which should reduce custodial exposures
well below the historic levels (indeterminate) which may have been experienced by the workers studied in the above
reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More generally, there would be remaining significant risk at this new 0.1 f/cc exposure limit if there were not other
provisions to these standards. However, the exposure limit is accompanied by mandated work practice controls and
requirements for hazard communication, training and other provisions. Together these will very substantially
reduce that remaining significant risk, although the exact amount of that reduction cannot be quantified. In addition,
it would be difficult to measure accurately in the industrial setting levels lower than those in these standards.
OSHA believes its approach of setting a PEL which is reliably measurable, yet, imposing work practices and ancillary
provisions for operations regardless of measured fiber levels will result in risk reduction well below that expected
from just enforcing the 0.1 f/cc PEL. Thus, a lower PEL would not produce significant worker benefit.

(4) Multi-Employer Worksites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d) Construction and Shipyard Employment Standards. OSHA is retitling paragraph (d) ``multi-employer
worksites.'' The first provision, the same regulatory text as in the 1986 construction standard, requires that an
employer whose work requires the establishment of a regulated area must inform other on-site employers of the asbestos
work, and how other employees will be protected from hazards stemming from that work. In addition, new provisions
follow which set out the compliance responsibilities of employers on multi-employer worksites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, OSHA had proposed more comprehensive provisions governing communication of asbestos hazards among all
employers, building and facility owners and employees, in a revised paragraph (d). These final standards expand
communication provisions but repositions them in paragraph (k), ``communication of hazards.'' A discussion of
those provisions is found below in this preamble under that heading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) set out the compliance responsibilities of employers on multi-employer worksites. They
acknowledge that on asbestos work sites, like other construction sites, employees exposed to a hazard are not always
the employees of the employer who created the hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2) incorporates the rules now applied in enforcement actions governing multi-employer construction
sites generally, to assure that all employees on such a site receive the protection intended by the standards.(See
Gelco Builders, Inc. 6 BNA 1104). The standard explicitly requires asbestos hazards to be abated ``by the contractor
who created or controls the source of asbestos contamination.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, paragraph (d)(3) sets forth the duties of the employer of employees who are exposed to asbestos hazards,
but who did not create the source of contamination. One, such employer may request the contractor with control of the
hazard to take corrective action. For example, if there is a breach of an enclosure within which asbestos work is being
performed, the employer of employees working outside that enclosure should request the asbestos contractor who
erected the enclosure to repair the breach immediately, as required by paragraph (d)(2). If the repair is not made,
and if employees working outside the enclosure are exposed to asbestos in more than de minimis amounts, the employer
of those employees should either remove them from the worksite pending repairs, or consider his employees to be working
within a regulated area and comply with the provisions of paragraph (e) governing exposure assessments and monitoring
of employees who work within such areas. If the employer of employees exposed to asbestos because of the failure of
controls installed by another contractor, is the general contractor of the construction project, as such he has supervisory
control over the entire worksite including the regulated area, and is responsible for violations which could be abated
or prevented by the exercise of such supervisory capacity.

Paragraph (d)(3) of the construction standard states the enforcement rule that regardless of who created a hazard,
the employer of exposed employees is required to comply with applicable protective provisions to protect his employees.
An example recited in the regulatory text presents the situation of employees working immediately adjacent to a Class
I regulated area. If there is a breach of the enclosure or the critical barriers surrounding the asbestos work, employees
working immediately adjacent to the work may be exposed to asbestos. The employer responsible for erecting the enclosure
is required to insure its integrity. However, in the event that such repair is delayed or not made, the employer of the
exposed ``bystander employees'' must designate a ``competent person'' to evaluate the exposure potential, conduct
initial monitoring or an ``exposure assessment,'' and supervise other required protective actions. The evaluation
may include the amount of time and frequency adjacent workers are exposed. For example, although passing through
a contaminated area on the way to perform non-asbestos related activities is technically work which exposes employees
to asbestos, the competent person's evaluation properly may conclude that no appreciable exposure is possible because
of the brevity of the ``work'' in the area.

(5) Regulated Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (e) General Industry, Construction and Shipyard Employment Standards. Regulated areas are a traditional
component of OSHA health standards. They segregate both the work and the worker so as to better regulate the work, and
to protect uninvolved employees from exposure. The 1986 standards required regulated areas for work above the PELs
and in construction, for demolition, renovation and removal activities. The final standards require that regulated
areas be established where the PELS are likely to be exceeded, and under the construction and shipyard employment
standards, where Class I, II and III asbestos work is performed. These requirements are substantively similar to
those proposed in 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basic requirements of the regulated areas are the same for all three standards, They are changed from the current
standard to more coherently reflect the rest of the standard's provisions. For example, paragraph (e)(2) which requires
the regulated area to be ``demarcated to minimize the number of persons within the area, and to protect persons outside
the area from exposure to airborne concentrations of asbestos'' has been changed in two ways. The phrase ``in any manner,''
has been deleted. Since, paragraph (g) requires critical barriers for Class I and II work, and paragraph (k) requires
warning signs outside regulated areas, demarcation must incorporate barriers and signs where otherwise required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has also deleted the phrase ``in excess of the TWA and/or excursion limit'' in the construction and shipyard employment
standards to describe the level of protection intended to be offered persons outside the regulated area. Since OSHA
has determined that a still significant risk remains below the PELS, intended protection should not be limited to
protecting down to these levels. OSHA noted in its 1990 proposal that in the construction standard, ``the regulated
area controls are proposed to apply even when exposures may be less than the newly proposed PEL of 0.1 f/cc'' (55 FR at
29716), however, no change was proposed for the ``demarcation'' provision. Paragraph (e)(3) is unchanged and continues
to limit access to regulated areas to ``authorized persons.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulated area requirements for construction and shipyard industry delete former and proposed (e)(6),
which dictated when negative pressure enclosures (NPEs) must be erected, and various duties required of the ``competent
persons'' to ensure integrity of the regulated area and enclosure. Under OSHA's former approach, negative pressure
enclosures were, in many cases, how construction employers should have demarcated their regulated areas. OSHA focussed
on the role of such enclosures in providing ``bystander protection.'' In these final standards, OSHA is repositioning
the NPE provisions to paragraph (g), ``methods of compliance.'' There, these systems are required to reduce exposures
of the employees who are disturbing the asbestos who are inside the enclosures, as well as employees outside the enclosure.

(6) Exposure Assessment and Monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d) General Industry. There are no changes to the exposure monitoring provisions of the General Industry
Standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f) Construction and Shipyard Employment Standard. To conform with the newly revised approach to categorization
of asbestos work, and to reflect the difficulties of reliably estimating asbestos exposures based on limited past
or current exposure monitoring, the requirements for exposure monitoring in the 1986 standard have been changed.
First, there is a general requirement that all employers who have a workplace covered by this standard conduct an ``initial
exposure assessment'' at the beginning of each asbestos job [(paragraph (f)(2)]. Exceptions to this requirement
exist only for most Class IV work. The ``assessment'' must be conducted by the ``competent person.'' The purposes
of these ``assessments'' are to predict whether exposure levels during the planned asbestos work can be expected
to exceed the PELs, and thus whether additional monitoring, and other precautions are required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Initial assessments'' are different from ``initial monitoring'' required in the 1986 standards. ``Initial monitoring''
as used for processes in general industry, was rationally relied on to estimate future exposures for that purpose.
Historic monitoring data were considered second-best data. The new requirement for ``initial exposure assessments''
acknowledges that initial exposure monitoring in many cases cannot adequately predict all future exposures on construction
jobs. Even if monitoring results were instantaneously available, the value of early exposure monitoring in predicting
later exposures over a multi-day asbestos job is limited. First-day exposures are likely to be lower than later exposures,
because they reflect early set-up rather than removal activities, conducted in relatively clean areas before disturbance
may contaminate the regulated area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One purpose of the initial exposure assessment is to identify which asbestos jobs are likely to exceed the PEL in time
for employers to install and implement the extra controls required to reduce such exposures. Such additional controls
may consist of ventilation which redirects the air away from the over-exposed employees, and mandatory protective
clothing and hygiene facilities associated with donning and removing such gear. Even employers who are planning
to install full negative pressure enclosures with air flushing technology must conduct initial exposure assessments.
This will insure that the ``competent person'' has reviewed the success of controls in past projects, in order to evaluate
the planned controls for the current project. Testimony and comment to the record emphasized that the evaluation
of industrial hygienists or other properly trained personnel was essential to decision making on how best to protect
workers. For example, David Kirby of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, agreed with the statement that before there is
any operation involving asbestos containing material, the industrial hygiene staff makes a determination as to
whether that's likely to be a high risk, relatively high risk or a low risk operation (Tr. 197). Other participants
endorsed requiring advance assessment of asbestos-disturbing jobs (see e.g., ORC, Ex. 145, p. 6).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The former ``initial monitoring'' provisions allowed use of historic data. OSHA now requires the evaluation of data
from earlier asbestos jobs to estimate exposures on new jobs. However, the ``data'' reviewed are more than air monitoring
results. This record has convinced the Agency that consideration of factors in successfully controlling asbestos
exposures needs to be a part of the assessment. In addition to measurement results, the assessment must review relevant
controls and conditions, factors that influence the degree of exposure. These include, but are not limited to, the
degree and quality of supervision and of employee training, techniques used for wetting the ACM in the various circumstances
encountered, placing and repositioning the ventilation equipment, and impacts due to weather conditions. The assessment
therefore must be based on the competent person's review of all aspects of the employer's performance doing similar
jobs. Only if similar controls are used and the work supervised by the same or similarly trained personnel, may past
data be relied on. In addition, the results of initial monitoring required if feasible, must inform the competent
person's assessment. Judgment of the ``competent person'' is required when reviewing records of past work. For example,
even where an employer's earlier glove bag removals produced some exposures above the PEL, if more recent glove bag
removals by the same crew show no exceedances, the ``competent person'' may be warranted in predicting that the current
job performed by the same crew will be well controlled and exposures will not exceed the PELs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other basis allowed for an initial exposure assessment is ``objective data'' to show that it is, in effect, impossible
for a job to result in excessive exposures. The 1986 standard, 1926.58, paragraph (f)(2)(ii), allowed such data to
demonstrate that the ``product or material containing asbestos cannot release *&blank;*&blank;* (excessive)
concentrations *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Since the record of this proceeding shows that almost all asbestos products
may in time become hazardous, if for example, their matrix becomes disturbed, the activity, as well as the material,
is the exposure-limiting factor. OSHA therefore now allows a showing that a specific activity involving a product
is incapable of producing exceedances. The ``objective data'' must demonstrate that under ``the work conditions
having the greatest potential for releasing asbestos,'' an activity coupled with a specific material, simply cannot
result in excessive concentrations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA cannot predict all the combinations of activity and product which will meet this test. OSHA believes instead
that construction employers should be given the responsibility for making these determinations for their particular
work. However, on the record of this proceeding, they would appear to be limited to Class IV activities, or certain
Class III activities such as limited removal of intact asbestos containing gaskets using wet methods and containment
methods. OSHA notes that under no conditions can a Class I removal qualify for this exemption; based on the record of
this rulemaking, every removal activity involving TSI and surfacing ACM is capable of releasing fibers above the
PEL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are separate provisions regarding a ``negative initial exposure assessment'' which is a demonstration that
the activity involving the asbestos material is unlikely under all foreseeable conditions to result in concentrations
above the PELs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The competent person must exercise judgment in performing these exposure assessments. For example, if initial monitoring
is evaluated the first day's measurements which reflect set-up activities may not adequately predict later exposures
on a removal job. The competent person should examine both the first day's exposures and comparable full job exposure
data from other comparable jobs, before a conclusion is reached that exposures on that job will not exceed the PELs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In large measure, the required bases for making a ``negative exposure assessment'' in the revised construction standard
are the same criteria which would, under the 1986 standard, have allowed an employer to claim an exemption from initial
monitoring based on ``historic data.'' The standard makes it more difficult to base an initial exposure assessment
on historic data than did the previous provision for initial determination. Now, the assessment must consider, the
experience and training of the crews. Therefore, the standard now requires that a negative exposure assessment must
compare crews with comparable experience and training, an employer cannot compare untrained and inexperienced
crews. And no ``negative exposure assessment'' can be made if the crews which disturb asbestos in the current job are
untrained. OSHA believes that a major factor in the effectiveness of all control systems for removing asbestos-containing
materials is the experience and training of the contractor and employees. Evidence in the record shows dramatic reductions
in exposure levels as untrained employees learned proper glove bag techniques (see e.g., the NIOSH study, Ex. 125).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lack of a ``negative exposure determination'' usually indicates that workers are not experienced/trained or
that a job is complex. In such situations, additional protections, less dependent on experience of the workers, or
the complexity of the job, should be required. Thus, critical barriers are required in all Class I and II work, and for
Class III work, plastic barriers are required, where negative exposure assessments are not produced. If the employer
cannot assure that levels will be minimized, protection against migration of asbestos dust must be provided. Similarly,
if excessive levels are possible, employees in all classes must be protected by respirator use and the standard so
requires. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes its approach balances the concern that asbestos exposure levels vary from job to job and may be non-predictive
of future levels with the Agency's knowledge gained from long-term enforcement of the asbestos standard, that different
employers have different ``track records.'' The negative initial exposure assessment provisions require consideration
of factors which have been identified as influencing the variability of results. In fact, one commenter stated that
``*&blank;*&blank;* it is invalid to predict that any particular operation is always below the PEL,'' identified
critical contributing variables as ``the materials, work practices and experience of the crew'' (Ex. 7&hyph;52).
OSHA is requiring the ``negative exposure assessment'' to be based on these, among other, factors. OSHA emphasizes
that a ``negative exposure assessment'' does not predict exposure levels beyond a particular job. A new assessment
must be produced each time another job is undertaken. Employers may evaluate repetitive operations with highly similar
characteristics, as one job, such as cable pulling in the same building, so long as the historic data used also reflect
repetitive operations of the same duration and frequency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In sum, OSHA believes data specific to the building, contractor and employees is helpful in predicting exposures
when the same variables apply. The lack of such data should require additional precautions. Additionally, unless
there is a ``negative exposure assessment,'' the employer must continue to conduct periodic monitoring. Periodic
monitoring, in a change from the 1986 construction standard, now is required within the regulated areas of Class I
and Class II asbestos jobs and for Class III asbestos work where the initial assessment projects that the PEL is reasonably
likely to be exceeded. In these operations the employer is to perform daily monitoring representative of the exposure
of each workers performing these tasks. The provisions allowing discontinuance of monitoring, additional monitoring,
observation of monitoring are unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not a remanded issue, several participants discussed the subject of a clearance fiber level to determine
when a regulated area could be reoccupied following asbestos operations. Some supported use of a clearance level
with aggressive sampling and analysis in accredited laboratories (Ex. 141, 143). Most who supported a clearance
level stated support for the AHERA level of 0.01 f/cc or background fiber level (40 CFR 736.90). A representative of
the US Navy felt that measurement of the quality of abatement_a clearance level_was needed, but that it should not
be considered to be a ``health standard'' (Ex. 7&hyph;52). In a similar vein, the Resilient Floor Covering Institute
(Ex. 147, Tr. 279) and a representative of the American Paper Institute pointed out that a permissible exposure limit
and a clearance level are not the same and should not be confused; the former is health-based and the latter a measure
of cleanliness (Ex. 7&hyph;74). Mr. Churchill an asbestos consultant, supported a clearance requirement and felt
that the person performing this measurement should be an independent entity (Ex. 7&hyph;95). As mentioned earlier,
the Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee recommended adoption of a clearance level of 0.04 f/cc measured
non-aggressively (Ex. 7&hyph;77). The submission of the Monsanto Company expressed their desire that OSHA not adopt
a clearance requirement (Ex. 7&hyph;125). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has not included a provision for a specific ``clearance level'' in these revised standards. In reviewing the
record, there is no clear evidence of a linkage between such a requirement and subsequent lessening of worker exposure.
Clearly, regulated areas must be cleaned following asbestos work. However, designation of a specific fiber level
which must be attained before an area can be reoccupied does not appear to be necessary for worker health when all other
provisions of the standard are complied with. Meeting the requirements of the standards will protect workers and
bystander employees and will prevent the migration of fibers from the work area. The docket contains some data indicating
that attainment of a clearance level (either background or 0.01 f/cc) does not conclusively predict fiber levels
which will occur in formerly regulated areas (Ex. 1&hyph;23, 162&hyph;19). Therefore, OSHA has not included a quantitative
cutoff to determine whether a work area has been adequately cleaned to allow re-entry, rather the standards now require
that the information regarding the final monitoring of the prior work be provided to those reoccupying the area. However,
OSHA recognizes the need for adequate cleaning of the worksite following disturbance/removal of asbestos.

OSHA proposed several changes to the methods of compliance provisions. One was to require specific work practice
and engineering controls for brake and clutch repair; another was to regulate the maintenance of asbestos-containing
flooring by prohibiting certain kinds of work practices and requiring others; the third was to require that engineering
and work practice controls to achieve the newly reduced PEL of 0.1 f/cc be phased-in to coincide with the imposition
of the EPA ban for various industrial sectors which manufacture asbestos containing material (see 55 FR 29721&hyph;29726).
The final general industry standard retains the conceptual outline of these proposed changes; however the details
differ.

OSHA is adding a mandatory appendix to its asbestos standard for general industry and to the shipyard employment standard.
This appendix specifies the engineering controls and work practices to be followed during brake and clutch work.
Two methods of control are ``preferred,'' the enclosure/HEPA vacuum method and the low pressure/recycle method.
In operations in which such work is infrequent (i.e., establishments performing fewer than 5 brake jobs per week),
simple wet methods are included among the ``preferred'' controls. Also, use of ``equivalent'' methods of control
is permitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the July 20, 1990 proposed revision of the general industry asbestos standard, OSHA proposed that the employer
comply with the standard by implementing one of three specified methods of engineering controls and work practices
to control asbestos exposure during automotive brake and clutch repair and assembly operations. These methods were
the enclosed cylinder/HEPA vacuum system, the spray can/solvent system, and the wet brush-recycle method. Detailed
requirements for these three methods were set out in proposed Appendix F. Once having properly used one of these methods,
the employer would have been exempt from other requirements of the standard. OSHA preliminarily found that the use
of these methods would routinely result in exposure levels below the PEL. The proposal also would have allowed the
employer to comply with the standard by using an ``equivalent'' method, which follows written procedures, which
the employer demonstrates can achieve results equivalent to Method A, [the enclosed cylinder/HEPA vacuum system,
Proposed 1910.1001 (f)(x)]. This proposed revision differed from the 1986 standard in two ways. The earlier standard
set out two methods of reducing exposure in a non-mandatory appendix. Secondly, the controls themselves are somewhat
different; one method, the wet brush-recycle method, was added; the enclosed cylinder/HEPA vacuum system was revised,
and the spray can/solvent system is retained. OSHA endorsed these three methods based primarily on the results of
a NIOSH study completed after the 1986 standard which found that all three methods effectively reduced exposure levels
during brake drum servicing operations to below the proposed PEL of 0.1 f/cc (Ex. 1&hyph;112). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final standard OSHA lists two ``preferred methods,'' the wet-brush recycle methods and the enclosure/HEPA
vacuum system. OSHA is deleting the solvent/spray method from the list of preferred methods. OSHA still is listing
the above two methods as ``preferred,'' but the description of these methods is more generic than in the proposal,
so as not to preclude use of methods which differ from those described in the proposal in minor ways which are unlikely
to affect their efficiency. In addition, specific training provisions are added to ensure that work practices are
effectively followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Like the proposal, ``equivalent'' methods are allowed so long as required training is held. The employer must show
that the ``equivalent'' method can reliably achieve exposures below the PEL in the workplace conditions where the
method is sought to be used. In addition employers using such ``equivalent'' methods must demonstrate by exposure
data from their workplaces using the equivalent method, or by reference to exposure data representing conditions
similar to their workplace that the anticipated exposure reduction in fact, has been achieved. OSHA believes that
these changes will allow employers to choose among various proven approaches and encourage the development of new
devices and practices which effectively reduce exposures in brake and clutch repair facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considerable comment and testimony were submitted to the record by the public concerning OSHA's proposed revisions
on protection for automotive repair workers. Information concerning additional methods to achieve asbestos control
during brake repair was submitted. These additional methods include HEPA vacuum systems without an enclosed cylinder
(Ex. 7&hyph;104), using water spray instead of solvent spray (Ex. 7&hyph;104, 7&hyph;04), enclosures shaped other
than cylindrically (Ex. 7&hyph;127), and collecting the drips of sprays from the solvent spray method (Ex. 1&hyph;84).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters claimed that OSHA should not require any specific method of reducing airborne asbestos exposure
to brake and clutch repair workers, but merely require that the PEL be achieved (Ex. 7&hyph;31, 7&hyph;43, 7&hyph;79,
7&hyph;104, 7&hyph;146). Other commenters pointed out that most brake service operations are performed by small
businesses that lack resources to evaluate control devices (Ex. 1&hyph;112). Evidence submitted concerning the
airborne asbestos fiber levels produced by the use of most of the suggested methods showed exposures consistently
below the proposed PEL of 0.1 f/cc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various comments concerned the ``wet brush-recycle method.'' A developer of an enclosure method for brake/clutch
repair asbestos control, recommended that the term be broadened to allow ``more latitude in design preference for
the manufacturer'' (Ex. 162&hyph;41). He suggested that the name be changed to ``low pressure/wet cleaning'' method.
He also asked that OSHA use a more general term to describe the preferred enclosure method, objecting to specification
of its shape as cylindrical. OSHA agrees that the shape of the enclosure need not be specified and that the term suggested,
``negative pressure enclosure/HEPA vacuum system,'' was appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, R. Wagner of BP of America felt that it was not necessary that the wet brush/recycle method actually include
a brush and presented monitoring results indicating effective fiber control when spraying on the solution without
brushing (Ex. 7&hyph;24). OSHA agrees that, although a brush is useful in cleaning the components, the preferred
method will be designated low pressure/wet cleaning and will not specify the use of a brush. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A manufacturer of a low pressure/wet cleaning apparatus, objected to OSHA requiring use of an aqueous solution in
the machine (Ex. 162&hyph;1). OSHA understands that the organic solution in the apparatus is a degreaser used as a
parts cleaner. Mr. Swartz in testimony explained that solvents are used as degreasers, but that most brake work does
not require degreasing_he estimated that only once per 200 to 300 brake jobs would such a solvent be needed (Tr. 1843).
OSHA has determined that it will maintain the requirement that aqueous solutions be used in this procedure to control
asbestos fiber levels. OSHA further warns of the potential danger of solvent use in these operations and that use of
solvents, which are often flammable and may be carcinogenic, must be undertaken with great care. OSHA also stresses
the need for low pressure application of the solution to the surfaces during this operation to avoid asbestos fiber
release and the necessity that the asbestos-contaminated solution not be allowed to dry on surfaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A manufacturer of a wet brush-recycle type brake cleaner, Hilgren of Kleer Flo, offered the following advice to users
of this method regarding disposal of waste: ``Our recommended method of disposal is to simply add adsorbent material
such as ``floor-dry'' to the waste bag. Then direct the flow through brush into the bag containing the absorbent material.
Allow the machine to pump the solution from the reservoir'' (Ex. 7&hyph;117). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most relevant comments supported the effectiveness of two of the three proposed ``preferred'' methods: the enclosure/HEPA
vacuum method and the wet wash/recycle system. However, substantial opposition was directed at OSHA's preference
for the solvent spray system. For example, George Swartz, Director of Safety for Midas International Corporation
testified that ``the utilization of an aerosol system is ludicrous'' (Tr. 1840). One, some of the solvents used in
commercial preparations are suspect carcinogens. Two, use of a spray can does not reliably control exposures due
to asbestos dust in the brake assembly, because of the difficulties of removing the drum, and that after removal asbestos
containing dust in the assembly cannot easily be reached by a aerosolized spray. Three, certain solvent sprays, according
to Mr. Swartz, can damage friction material and the rubber parts of the cups which force the brake shoe out to the drum
(Tr.1840&hyph;46). Another witness, James E. Clayton, testified that ``you can't take a can of compressed solution
like this (Gunk brake cleaner) and just spray it on dry dust without it getting into the air.'' (id at 1914&hyph;15).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) agreed in its post-hearing comment that the use of spray can with
certain solvents is potentially dangerous, and suggested that nonhazardous sprays or aerosols be allowed (Ex. 150).
Another participant described an occasion in which the spray can was accidentally dropped, punctured, and released
solvent into the work area (Ex. 7&hyph;24). The safety director at Fruehauf Trailer Operations, asked ``why is it
necessary to use a solvent as opposed to water? *&blank;*&blank;* why couldn't it be used in place of a solvent in the
performance of brake and clutch work?'' (Ex. 7&hyph;4). Mr. Swartz agreed that ``simple water and detergent can be
as effective'' (Ex. 1&hyph;176) However, he insisted that it be a gentle mist of water and that resulting drips be caught
and proper disposal carried out (Tr. 1852). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees with these comments and witnesses. The Agency notes that some of the solvents contained in the spray cans
used to spray brake assemblies present significant health risks. As a matter of public health policy, it is better
not to list as preferred, a compliance method which introduces another hazardous substance into the breathing zone
of the worker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the effectiveness of the solvent/spray method is compromised by the reported need to use additional force
to remove asbestos deposited in the brake assembly, which the spray cannot reach. Additionally, comment and testimony
indicate that the force of the aerosol spray by itself can make airborne the asbestos-containing dust. OSHA noted
in the proposal, that the spray/solvent can method produced the highest airborne concentrations of the methods tested
by NIOSH (55 FR at 29724). OSHA notes that although it based its endorsement of the solvent/spray method on the NIOSH
study, as Mr. Swartz pointed out, ``the issue of the residual dust left in a drum, I don't think, was properly addressed
in that study *&blank;*&blank;* (In) the real world, *&blank;*&blank;* the mechanic will either dump it on the ground
or he'll dump it in a garbage can. At the end of the day he's going to sweep the floor, and he's sweeping the dust up'' (Id
at 1845). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, in this final standard the spray/solvent can method is no longer a ``preferred method,'' the use of which will
exempt employers from other provisions of the standard. Although the standard does not prohibit the use of solvent
sprays in brake and clutch repair to control asbestos exposure, employers will have to comply with other provisions
in the asbestos and other standards when using the method. Initial monitoring must be undertaken to assure that exposures
are likely to remain under the PEL, provisions of the hazard communication standard relating to communicating the
hazard potential of the solvent used, and training employees in avoiding exposure to such solvent must be complied
with. Employees must be specifically informed that the solvent/spray method is not preferred, and OSHA's reasons
for that decision must be explained to them, as part of that training. Employers must provide for the prompt cleanup
of all asbestos containing liquid or debris which is produced by any brake cleaning method, including a solvent/spray.
Thus, solvent-wetted asbestos containing material must be HEPA vacuumed when it reaches the ground, because waiting
will result in dried and airborne dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the methods tested by NIOSH was the use of a HEPA vacuum alone, without enclosure. The National Automobile Dealers
Association representative, D. Greenhaus, encouraged OSHA to include this in its list of preferred methods of asbestos
control in brake work stating that this was the method already in use in many places (Ex. 7&hyph;104). The Sheehy (NIOSH)
study noted that'' *&blank;*&blank;* the drums must be removed before the vacuum cleaner can be used, thus there is
a potential for asbestos release during drum removal'' (Ex. 1&hyph;112), and P. Carpenter of Nilfisk stated ``[t]he
greatest potential for exposure occurs when the brake drum is first removed'' (Ex. 7&hyph;140). OSHA agrees that
the potential for exposure during drum removal before the HEPA vacuum can be used precludes listing including this
as a preferred method. Moreover, NIOSH found that HEPA systems alone do not clean the brake components as effectively
as the other methods (Ex. 1&hyph;112). Mr. Greenhaus also recommended that OSHA prohibit three activities during
brake operations: dry brushing, air hose cleaning and use of non-HEPA vacuums. NIOSH agreed that such prohibitions
are necessary and OSHA concurs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One related issue is whether to require respirator use for employees when changing filters or bags from vacuums. OSHA
proposed that they not be required when changing HEPA filters, noting that filter changes occurred infrequently,
recorded fiber levels during changes were not excessive, and other requirements triggered by respirator use, such
as medical examinations and fit testing procedures, did not appear to confer any significant benefit to employees.
One participant, Mr. Clayton, who initially disagreed with OSHA's proposal not to require respirators for filter
changes, clarified that the ancillary requirements for a respirator program, ``would scare everybody away from
wanting to do it *&blank;*&blank;* and would be a rather heavy burden for most employers'' (Tr. 1931). Mr. Clayton
pointed out that exposure potential existed not only during filter changes, but during vacuum bag changes as well.
He further pointed out that although HEPA filter changes were infrequent, bags ``could be changed as often as every
three to five weeks by a shop'' (Id at 1929). Mr. Clayton described two systems of ensuring that bag changing does not
expose employees to asbestos containing dust. Under one system the bag is collected under negative pressure; under
the other the bag is made from non-woven material and is ``virtually undestructible.'' OSHA has concluded that so
long as filters and vacuum bags are changed using work practices to minimize rupture and spillage, exposure from that
activity will be de minimis, and respirator use is not required to protect employees. Accordingly, additional work
practices relating to filter changes, when a vacuum is used, are included in the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is allowing another method to be used in shops in which brake work comprises only a minor portion of the workload,
and thus where employee exposure is infrequent and minimal. For those shops in which brake work is infrequent, OSHA
has determined to allow the use of a wet method of control as a ``preferred'' method. Therefore, in facilities in which
no more than 5 pairs of brakes or 5 clutches, or some combination totaling 5, are repaired each week, the mechanic/technician
may control potential asbestos exposure through the use of a pump sprayer (bottle) containing water or amended water
to wet down the drum or clutch housing before it is removed and to control fiber release during subsequent activities.
The mechanic may use other implements to deliver the water such as a garden hose; however, the resulting waste water
generated must be caught and properly disposed of without allowing it to dry on any surfaces. OSHA anticipates that
the use of a spray bottle will be adequate to control the dust without generating a large volume of waste water, however
any waste water generated must be disposed of properly. OSHA applied a qualitative analysis using its risk management
expertise in making the decision that allows less effective controls for facilities that do 5 or fewer brake and 5 or
fewer clutch repair jobs per week. Relevant factors were the magnitude of the risk of asbestos caused disease estimated
in the 1986 risk assessment at levels of exposure in vehicle repair facilities, the duration of exposure, and the practicality
of using controls in the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In describing the usual work practices of mechanics performing brake jobs, Mr. Swartz of Midas Corporation reported
that it was occasionally necessary for the mechanic/technician to dislodge a ``frozen'' brake drum; this was usually
performed by striking it with a hammer (Ex. 1&hyph;176). When performed within an enclosure under negative pressure,
this operation would be unlikely to expose the worker to asbestos fibers; however, when using the other methods it
is essential that the exterior of the drum, especially around the seams, be thoroughly wetted to minimize fiber release.
OSHA concurs and thus will require that before attempts are made to dislodge a ``frozen'' brake drum, the drum must
be thoroughly wetted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments were received which dealt with minor alterations in wording which would render the requirements clearer
and more specific and some of these have been incorporated into the language of Appendix F (Appendix L in the shipyard
employment standard). Several participants noted that additional activities, such as inspection and disassembly
of brakes could also result in exposure and should be included. Mr. Swartz explained that brakes are frequently checked
to determine whether they are defective and this involves removal of the drums and results in potential exposure to
asbestos-containing dust (Tr. 1843). OSHA agrees that these activities should be covered by the rule and has included
them in the language of the final rule. Therefore the following activities will be listed and will require implementation
of the provisions of the mandatory appendix F (appendix L in the shipyard employment standard): clutch and brake inspection,
disassembly, repair and assembly.

Mr. Swartz also testified that brake shoes are recycled and new friction material is placed on re-used metal frames
(Tr. 1871). A letter forwarded to OSHA by EPA Brian Putnam, whose work experience included 4 years of delivering auto
parts to garages and service stations, stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* it is my observation that auto parts employees face significant exposure to asbestos from brake
shoe cores, brake drums, and clutches. Not only do they store cores for exchange with the manufacturers, most also
turn brake drums which come in with a *&blank;*&blank;* coating of dust on them (Ex. 1&hyph;133).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The asbestos standard 1910.1001 (k)(1) states that ``all surfaces shall be maintained as free as practicable of accumulations
of dusts and waste containing asbestos,'' and subsequently in (k)(6) specifically states that items consigned for
disposal which are contaminated shall be sealed in impermeable bags or other closed impermeable containers. In order
to include materials which are contaminated and scheduled for recycling, not disposal, the phrase ``or recycling''
is added to this provision (k)(6), which now is as follows: Waste, scrap, debris, bags, containers, equipment and
clothing contaminating with asbestos consigned for disposal or recycling, shall be collected and disposed of in
sealed impermeable bags, or other closed, impermeable containers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Engineering controls and good work practices should be implemented at all times during brake servicing. Because
of the health hazards associated with asbestos exposure, these actions must be considered even when the worker believes
that the brake shoes do not contain asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received several comments pointing out a need for training requirements for brake and clutch mechanics. For
example J. Clayton of Clayton Associates, Inc supported a training requirement for brake and clutch repair workers
citing as examples that New Jersey required one day training for mechanics and that Maryland requires training for
those covered under its asbestos program. He estimated the cost of training at $150 and noted that certified instructors
were required in both these states (Ex. 7&hyph;127). OSHA agrees that workers exposed to asbestos must be trained
in appropriate ways to avoid exposure to airborne asbestos fibers. Therefore, OSHA has provided a mandatory appendix
outlining the work practices to be used in performing these operations, and has included a requirement that brake
and clutch repair workers receive training in the appropriate use of these work practices.

Floor Maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (k)(7) General Industry Standard. The 1986 standard contained no provisions specifically covering work
practices on asbestos containing flooring materials. In 1990, OSHA proposed in paragraph (f)(xi) several limitations
on buffing and sanding asbestos containing flooring. In the housekeeping section of the final OSHA is prohibiting
or limiting three work practices relating to floor maintenance for asbestos-containing flooring materials and
those assumed to contain asbestos. They are: (i) sanding of asbestos-containing floor material is prohibited; (ii)
stripping of finishes shall be conducted using low abrasion pads at speed lower than 300 rpm and wet methods; and, (iii)
burnishing or dry buffing may be performed only on asbestos-containing flooring which has sufficient finish so that
the pad cannot contact the asbestos-containing material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA had proposed to allow asbestos containing floor tile to be buffed only with ``low abrasion pads at speeds of 190
rpm or less'' (See 55 FR at 22752). However, after a review of the record OSHA believes that restricting sanding of floor
materials, limiting the speed and abrasiveness of the pads and specifying use of wet methods for stripping floors,
and allowing buffing only on finished floors will protect floor care workers from exposure to airborne asbestos fibers
while performing the maintenance and will minimize future exposures due to deteriorating flooring caused by inadequate
maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g) Construction and Shipyard Employment Standards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``methods of compliance'' provisions are the core of the revised standards. They set generic, operation-specific
and exposure triggered requirements for conducting asbestos work. In the 1986 construction standard, provisions
dictating engineering controls and work practices for most construction jobs were contained in paragraph (e), governing
the ``regulated area.'' OSHA believes that paragraph (g), the methods of compliance section, is a more logical home
for these provisions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the requirements in paragraph (g) are instructions to use specified work practices. The work practice approach
to controlling asbestos exposure in construction activities is widely endorsed. It is the model for NESHAP regulation
under EPA (see 40 CFR 60.143), most state regulations and voluntary consensus guidelines. OSHA has tried to formulate
work practice requirements as simple, flexible instructions, embodying the basic control strategies for asbestos
dust suppression. These are to wet it down, contain the disturbance, and isolate the operation. The work practice-engineering
controls which are listed and described in the regulation are the ones which the rulemaking record confirms are used,
understood, and effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA expects that modifications and innovations in asbestos control technology will be developed. The standards
provide for this by setting up general criteria for alternative controls, and an easily met procedure to allow the
use of effective alternatives. Paragraph (g)(6) governs alternatives for Class I control methods, and paragraph
(g)(7)(vi) for Class II methods. For both classes, detailed written demonstrations of the effectiveness of the alternative/modification
are required and evaluations by designated persons are required. Alternatives for Class I work require a more rigorous
demonstration of effectiveness, and advance notice to OSHA of their use. OSHA intends these requirements to be capable
of being met by well-designed and tested alternative control methods. They are meant to exclude short-cut methods
which hope to evade the other provisions in the standard. By their inclusion, OSHA is stating its policy view that industry
has demonstrated its responsible innovative capability in the past, and will continue to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first provision in the construction methods of compliance paragraph, (g)(1)(i), requires that three basic and
simple controls be utilized in all operations covered by the construction standard, regardless of exposure levels
in those operations. These provisions apply to, for example, employers who install asbestos-containing material
(no Class designation), clean up asbestos-containing debris at a construction site (Class IV), repair a boiler covered
with asbestos-containing TSI (Class I or III), and remove asbestos-containing surfacing material (Class I). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The controls required are: use of HEPA filtered vacuums to collect debris and visible dust; use of wet methods to control
asbestos fiber dispersion; and prompt disposal of asbestos contaminated waste materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has imposed these controls to reduce airborne contamination by asbestos fibers disturbed during construction
activities. However fibers are released, contamination can be reduced by suppressing asbestos containing dusts,
and/or collecting them before they dry and are able to migrate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that most employers will be able to use wet methods, in handling asbestos-containing materials to reduce
the airborne migration of fibers. The use of wet methods to control airborne asbestos was not explicitly required
in the 1986 construction standard. It was mentioned among the control measures which could be used to keep down fiber
levels during ``maintenance and renovation projects in environments that do not lend themselves to the construction
of negative-pressure enclosures'' (51 FR 22711). In the Method of Compliance section, OSHA presented use of wet methods
among a list of engineering and work practice controls from which an employer could choose when seeking to comply with
the PEL. The 1972 asbestos standard had required the use of wet methods to the extent practicable to reduce the release
of asbestos fibers unless the usefulness of the product would be diminished by the use of such methods. On reconsideration,
OSHA now finds the use of wet methods to be an inexpensive, generally feasible, and highly effective way to control
release of asbestos fibers and returns to the earlier requirement for its use in all feasible situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is overwhelming record support for the use of wet methods (e.g., Exs. 7&hyph;1, 7&hyph;34, 7&hyph;37, 7&hyph;51,
7&hyph;52, 7&hyph;74, 7&hyph;86, 7&hyph;89, 7&hyph;99, 7&hyph;132, 119P, 143, Tr. 223, 722 and 756). Representatives
of most sectors, expressed support for a requirement for wet methods.(e.g., transite panel removal, Ex.7&hyph;74;
removal of asbestos packing, Ex. 7&hyph;99; floor tile maintenance, Ex 7&hyph;132; custodial or maintenance work,
Ex. 162&hyph;4, 162&hyph;25; floor tile and sheet removal, Ex 7&hyph;132; sheet gasket removal, Ex 119; cutting
of transite pipe, Ex.117, Tab 6 at 5, Tab 7 at 1). B. Kynock of the AIR Coalition endorsed the use of wet methods, stating:
``wetting of material is still considered a state of the art engineering control_using wet methods_because it is
the one definitive way we can keep fiber levels to a minimum'' (Tr. 3574). Evidence submitted into the record concerning
a variety of asbestos jobs showed significant decreases in exposure levels when wet methods were used, compared to
when the work was done dry [see e.g., re: sheet gasket removal (Ex.119&hyph;P)]. In the study by Paik 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1982 (Ex. 84&hyph;204) sprayed-on asbestos containing material was removed from eleven buildings, in one dry methods
were employed due to electrical considerations while wet methods were employed in the other buildings. The dry method
resulted in a geometric mean fiber level of 16.4 f/cc, while during the use of wet methods the geometric mean was 0.5
f/cc. OSHA notes that the OSHA PEL at the time the samples were taken was 2.0 f/cc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exxon (EUSA) submitted extensive sampling data indicating low fiber counts during outdoor removals in which wet
methods were used (Ex. 38). Exxon also submitted sampling data from the outdoor removal of pipeline wrap from underground
lines in which wetting was the primary means of control and in which 30 personal samples had an average fiber level less
than 0.03 f/cc (Ex. 127). It is noted that Exxon also submitted specific additional work practices used in conjunction
with wet methods to control fiber levels.

Requiring wet methods is consistent with EPA's regulatory scheme. Wet methods are required by EPA for removal and
demolition jobs falling within the jurisdictional limits of NESHAP, and are recommended by that Agency as part of
a basic ``O &amp; M'' program for building custodians and maintenance workers. (EPA, Managing Asbestos In Place,
Ex. 1&hyph;183, p. 18&hyph;19). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA/NESHAP, which requires facility owners and/or operators to control asbestos fiber emissions by wetting prior,
to during, and after demolition/removal, has provided guidance in a pamphlet entitled ``Asbestos/NESHAP Adequately
Wet Guidance'' (EPA 340/1&hyph;90&hyph;019, December 1990, Ex. 1&hyph;300). In this booklet two exceptions to
wetting are described: when temperature at the point of wetting if below freezing, and, when use of water would unavoidably
damage equipment or present a safety hazard. In the latter case, local exhaust ventilation and collection systems
to capture fibers must be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Others voiced reservation regarding a universal requirement for use of wet methods. E. Downey of US West, Inc. felt
that in the case of telecommunications industry and computer systems, use of wet methods would not be practical, particularly
in roofing operations (Ex. 7&hyph;79). J. Collins of the US Navy Office of Operations and others recommended ground
fault circuit use for avoiding the electrical hazards presented by use of wet methods (Ex. 7&hyph;52). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA will allow employers to claim infeasibility if they cannot use wet methods due to conditions such as electrical
hazards, hot surfaces, and the presence of technical equipment which cannot tolerate moisture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of wet methods for roofing was a major issue in this proceeding. Steven Phillips, counsel to the National Roofing
Contractors Association testified:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We have submitted for the record a report performed by SRI *&blank;*&blank;* their recommendation was that there
is no improvement on asbestos emissions and there are safety hazards involved in putting workers on roofs when wet
methods are utilized *&blank;*&blank;* (Tr. 2456). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Roofing Contractor's Association (NRCA) cited four reasons not to require wetting on roofs: ``the introduction
of water on the roof creates safety hazards, such as slipping; water on the roof can enter the building and cause damage
and electrical hazards; the introduction of water on the roof can damage the roof system (e.g., by soaking insulation
boards); the SRI International study reveals that roofing work involving wetting does not appear to produce either
higher or lower concentrations than work performed dry. We believe this is because of the nature of roof systems. They
are applied and in place to repel water. Thus, water (amended or unamended) does not penetrate the material_it just
rolls off of it'' (Ex. 7&hyph;112, p. 21). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some participants suggested that using wet methods on roofs should be recommended, but not required, because of safety
concerns. For instance, the asbestos administrator for Florida, noted that using wet methods on a sloped roof may
be more of a hazard to the workers, than the benefits gained (Ex. 7&hyph;6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, NIOSH recommended that before an operation (tear-off of asbestos-containing roofing material), the
roof should be wetted with water or other wetting agent (Ex. 44). BCTD noted in its post-hearing brief that ``the majority
of the jobs reported in the SRI Study, submitted by NRCA, employed wet methods'' (Ex. 143, citing Ex. 9&hyph;31A).
Various submissions noted that power cutting of built-up roofing is the standard method used to remove roofing material.
Use of this method generates dust which may contain asbestos (Ex. 1&hyph;357, 7&hyph;95, 7&hyph;96, 7&hyph;115).
The Paik study and other evidence demonstrate that wetting does substantially reduce exposure. OSHA believes that
continuous misting of the cutting blade during the cutting operation, whether performed by hand or by machine will
help to control dust. Field observations of such procedures have shown that little water is pooled as a result of the
misting process (Ex. 1&hyph;313), and that in most circumstances, evaporation will quickly occur. Therefore, OSHA
does not believe that the requirement to mist the cutting blade will create a slipping hazard on roofs under most circumstances.
If, however, a competent person determines that the specific conditions of a roofing job (e.g. a steeply sloping roof,
or below freezing temperatures) combined with the water resulting from any misting, would create a slipping hazard,
misting may be omitted, if other precautions are followed, such as equipping the power tool with a HEPA vacuum system,
or using hand methods.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Roofing Contractors Association said that currently there is no HEPA vacuum attached roofing cutter
(Ex. 146). However, a wide variety of power tools have been fitted with local exhaust systems that work very well, including
those used on tools for asbestos work. The 1972 asbestos standard required the use of local exhaust ventilation on
all hand-operated or powered tools which may produce or release asbestos fibers in excess of the permissible exposure
limit (37 FR 11320). The 1986 standard affirmed the requirement for ventilation for tools (51 FR 22715). We again reaffirm
it here. To the extent feasible, tools used for working with ACM must be equipped with local exhaust ventilation. Some
development work may be needed, but HEPA vacuum systems have been designed for many similar uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Basic Controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The other basic controls in (g)(1), required for all operations under the standard are intended to reduce exposure
caused by resuspension of asbestos fibers which have settled. The first is the requirement in (g)(1)(i) to use vacuum
cleaners equipped with HEPA filters or other methods to collect debris and visible dust containing ACM or PACM before
the material dries, which prevents the resuspension of fibers. This requirement complements the prohibition in
(g)(2)(iii), which prohibits dry clean-up, including sweeping and shoveling, of dust and debris containing ACM
or PACM. Although ``wet'' sweeping is not prohibited, it is not preferred, and may not be used to ``collect'' visible
dust and debris. Nor may dry ACM or PACM-containing dust or debris be collected by means other than vacuuming with a
HEPA filtered vacuum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was substantial record support for these requirements. As noted above these procedures apply to all asbestos
operations. In removal operations, the requirement to use wet methods in the removal [(g)(1)(ii)] will help assure
that resulting debris and dust can be collected before they dry out or are vacuumed up using vacuums equipped with HEPA
filters (g)(1)(i). Even if operations are conducted within negative pressure enclosures, debris and dust should
not remain uncollected for the entire work shift, because the resuspension of asbestos fibers from these sources
creates additional new exposures for employees. If the work is performed within glove bags, leaks in the bags may create
dust and debris. Fallen debris can be spread to parts of the building and thereby create widespread contamination.
If the collection bags or devices required by other provisions fail or fall short, prompt collection of the dust and
debris will limit the exposure to workers from such failure. If the negative pressure within the enclosure lapses,
prompt collection of dust and debris will protect employees outside the enclosure from resuspended fibers. For these
reasons, OSHA believes that careful treatment of asbestos waste and visible dust must be followed in all construction
and shipyard industry operations which expose employees to asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that for demolition and renovation work which is covered under NESHAP (40 CFR 61 Subpart M), all ACM must
be kept wet until sealed in a leak-tight container which includes an appropriate label. OSHA is extending this requirement
to all jobs under the standard, and now requires that all asbestos-contaminated waste be promptly disposed of in leak
tight containers [(g)(1)(iii)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Requirements for Operations Which May Exceed the PELs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (g)(2) applies to situations where it is expected that exposures may exceed the PEL, and thus additional
controls are required to keep exposures at or below the PEL. Paragraph (g)(2) requires that local exhaust ventilation
equipped with HEPA filter dust collection systems be installed for fixed processes involving asbestos handling
and for power tools used in installing, or otherwise handling asbestos containing materials. In addition, enclosure
or isolation of the asbestos releasing process must take place. These controls were listed as optional in the 1986
standard. They are now required, because of their proven ability to reduce dust levels in virtually all occupational
environments. These controls, in particular, apply to construction activities involving the installation of new
asbestos-containing construction materials, and in some cases the removal of previously installed material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
R.J. Pigg, President of the Asbestos Information Assn. of North America, testified that ``the tools that we use, (for
cutting asbestos-cement pipe as recommended work practices) are those that can be fitted with vacuum attachments.
We have studies that relate to those recommended work practices that *&blank;*&blank;* support, when they're being
followed, that you're well below the PEL'' (Tr. 558&hyph;9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, paragraph (g)(2) requires that where the exposures are expected to be above the PEL, ventilation to move
contaminated air away from exposed employees in the regulated areas toward a HEPA filtration or collection device
is required. This requirement is adapted from the current standard which lists ``general ventilation systems''
as one of the control methods to be used to achieve the PEL. However, OSHA believes that the term ``air sweeping away
from exposed employees toward a HEPA filtered exhaust device'' is more appropriate and effective. Further, it removes
the interpretative possibility that using a general building ventilation system to vent asbestos-contaminated
air, would be acceptable under the standard. A similar requirement is also aimed at Class I jobs which cannot produce
a negative initial exposure assessment [see (g)(4)(F)].

Paragraph (g)(3) sets out four prohibitions for all work under the standard. One prohibition, relating to high-speed
abrasive disc saws, is made more specific; one, prohibiting dry sweeping and dry clean-up of ACM and PACM is added;
and, one prohibiting employee rotation is expanded to apply to all attempts to reduce exposure, not, as in the 1986
standard, to reach the PEL. OSHA finds these changes will help reduce employee exposures and are consistent with the
revisions to the standards.

Controls for Asbestos Jobs According to Their Classification

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The next set of requirements in the ``Methods of Compliance'' beginning at paragraph-(g)(4), are keyed to the four
classes of construction activities, Class I through IV, relating to previously installed ACM and PACM, defined in
paragraph (b). The scheme is risk-based with Class I as the most hazardous, and Class IV the least so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class I asbestos work consists of the ``removal'' of asbestos-containing TSI and surfacing material and of PACM,
including demolition operations involving these materials. Class II work consists of the ``removal'' of all other
asbestos-containing materials, including resilient flooring presumed to contain asbestos. Class III work consists
of the ``disturbance'' of all previously installed asbestos-containing building materials and PACM. Class IV work
consists of housekeeping and custodial work in contact with previously installed ACM and PACM, and the clean-up of
debris on construction sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All asbestos work under the construction and shipbuilding standards is not in the ``class system.'' The installation
of new asbestos-containing products does not carry a class designation, and thus the class-specific requirements
do not apply to that activity. Work covered by the general industry standard is not included in the ``class system''
as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also notes that the differences in controls required among classes is not great. Further, the Agency believes
that the risk overlap between adjoining classes is neither frequent nor large, and that the standard allows the employer
flexibility in most such cases. The regulation requires job-by-job evaluation of regulated projects, and gives
the competent person some leeway in easing some requirements when it appears that the project can be done especially
safely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following examples illustrate how operations involving potential asbestos disturbance are to be classified.
If an insulated pipe is leaking, and less than one standard glove bag's worth of TSI is ``disturbed'' (see definition
in paragraph B) in order to repair the leak, it is a Category III job. If the TSI is stripped from a section of piping to
inspect all the piping in an area for leaks, it is a Class I job. If the section of piping required to be stripped is less
than 25 feet, it is still a Class I job, but critical barriers may not be required if the initial exposure assessment
is ``negative'' [see (g)(4)(i)(B)]. If it is not clear which category the work belongs, the employer should assume
the higher, more restrictive, category applies, and should comply with the listed work practices and controls for
that category. OSHA believes that most asbestos work will fit easily into the categories which are defined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA found that the term ``small-scale, short-duration,'' insufficient to distinguish lower risk asbestos operations
which allow exemptions from generally required controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A historical perspective is useful to clarify this issue. In 1986, OSHA required that all removal, renovation, and
demolition operations, except for ``small-scale, short duration'' operations, be conducted within negative pressure
enclosures [29 CFR 1926.58(e)(6)(1986)]. The scope of both the requirement and the exemption was unclear. The requirement
did not explicitly apply to ``maintenance or repair'' operations, though most of the examples given were in that category.
The examples cited in the exemption included pipe repair, valve replacement, installing electrical conduits, installing
or removing drywall, roofing, and other general building maintenance operations. In addition, OSHA maintained
that it was not possible to specify with precision the exact size of a ``small-scale'' maintenance job or to pinpoint
the time involved in a ``short-duration'' task. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court of Appeals stated that OSHA had not drawn the parameters of the exemption with enough specificity and that
``the exception as now worded seems to erase the rule.'' As noted above the Court remanded the issue to OSHA to ``clarify
the exemption for ``small scale, short duration operations'' from the negative-pressure enclosure requirements.
Further the Court suggested that OSHA limit the exemption to ``work operations where it is impractical to construct
an enclosure because of the configuration of the work environment,'' stated by OSHA in the preamble to the 1986 rule,
as the intended scope of the exemption (51 FR at 22,711,2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, the consequences of qualifying for the exemption were less clear when the regulatory text was consulted.
Section (e)(6) of the 1986 standard allowed ``small-scale, short-duration operations'' to be exempt from the negative
pressure enclosure requirement for removal, demolition, and renovations operations. However, some contractors
successfully argued in enforcement actions, that a NPE was a particularized kind of a ``regulated area'' which the
overriding general provision required only in ``work areas where airborne concentrations of asbestos exceed or
can reasonably be expected to exceed the TWA and/or excursion limit'' (Section (e)(1)). To impart certainty to the
requirement OSHA issued a compliance directive which triggered the requirement at the PEL, and attempted to clarify
the kind of operations which would qualify for the exemption, in a job where exceedances of the PEL were expected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its July 20, 1990 proposal, OSHA would have required NPEs based on the type of work to be done; and sought to clarify
the definition of small-scale, short duration operations by proposing specific cutoffs for ``small'' and ``short.''
In addition, general criteria were proposed which were intended to amplify the exemptive criteria: operations must
be ``non-repetitive, affect small surfaces or volumes of material containing asbestos&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*
not expected to expose bystanders to significant amounts of asbestos&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* completed within
one work day.'' Cutoffs for specific operations were: repair or removal of asbestos on pipes: 21 linear feet; repair
or removal of asbestos panel; 9 square feet: pipe valves containing asbestos gaskets or electrical work that disturbs
asbestos: one worker, four hours, removal of drywall: one workday, endcapping of pipes and tile removal: four hours,
and installation of conduits: eight-hour work shift. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many participants agreed that using only the duration, and size of a job did not adequately characterize risk. Some
argued that all asbestos jobs were risky, indeed there should be little regulatory distinction made. For example,
NIOSH spokesperson, Richard Lemen, expressed the view that ``even with short duration, small-term jobs we still
feel that there is a risk to the worker, not only from the one time exposures, but from the potential of that worker doing
multiple jobs over periods of time&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;which increase the exposure each time and the
lung burden of asbestos to each of those exposures&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;we still feel that&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*
[these jobs] should be treated as protectively as the other type of jobs.'' (Tr. 244), [See to the same effect the testimony
of Mr. Cook, an abatement contractor who testified for the BCTD and Lynn McDonald, representing the Sheet-Metal Workers
Union, (Tr. 829ff)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed definition of small-scale, short duration operations included specification of the number of square
and linear feet of asbestos-containing material. There were numerous objections raised to the proposed values.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several participants suggested that the NESHAP cutoff of 260 square or 160 linear feet, used by EPA for notification,
be used as the cutoff for small-scale work (Ex. 7&hyph;9, 7&hyph;21, 7&hyph;39, 7&hyph;52, 7&hyph;113, 103, 1&hyph;53,
1&hyph;55). Others such as Edward Palagyi, a Florida State Asbestos Coordinator, felt that this cutoff was too high
for OSHA to use in its definition (Ex. 7&hyph;6).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several alternate amounts of material were suggested. Christopher Corrado of the Long Island Lighting Company (Ex.
7&hyph;29), James Foley of the New York Power Authority (Ex. 7&hyph;31) and Robert Brothers of Eastman Kodak (Ex.
7&hyph;81) recommended that OSHA adopt the amounts used by New York in its small-scale definition_25 linear and 10
square feet. William Dundulis of the Rhode Island Department of Health felt that to avoid confusion, OSHA should adopt
the same cutoff that EPA used in its Worker Protection Rule_3 linear and 3 square feet (7&hyph;124). Others suggested
that the amount of material be defined by the amount of asbestos-containing waste generated by the activity. For example,
Preston Quirk of Gobbell Hays suggested cutoff maximum of 55 gallon drum or 1 cubic yard of ACM waste material (Ex. 7&hyph;34),
while OSHA witness David Kirby suggested 3 glove bags worth of waste material or 10 linear feet as the cutoff of a small-scale
job (Ex. 7&hyph;111). BCTD suggested ``the lesser of (a) a yield of no more than 1&hyph;1/3 cubic feet (10 gallons)
of asbestos-containing waste material, or (b) a maximum length of 2 feet or a maximum area of no more than 8 square feet
of material containing asbestos.'' Noting that the amount of material covering a pipe varies with its diameter, (and
the thickness of the material) BCTD calculated that removal of 1 inch of insulation from common pipe dimensions can
vary from 1.37 to 5.04 cubic feet of waste. (Ex 143 at 131). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although OSHA believes that the amount of waste material generated by a job may be a valid index of its exposure potential,
the Agency agrees with participants who pointed out the difficulties of estimating the amount of waste material in
advance of the job. [e.g., testimony of Chip D'Angelo, an asbestos consultant, (Tr. 3086), Paul Fiduccia, representing
a number of real estate and building owner interests, (Tr. 791); Paul Heffernan of Kaselaan and D'Angelo Associates,
(Ex. 7&hyph;36)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various other quantitative limits were suggested which were tied to specific materials; (e.g. transite panels,
32 square feet (Ex. 7&hyph;94), 48 square feet (7&hyph;96). Mr. Churchill, representing the California Association
of Asbestos Professionals, suggested 9 square and 9 linear feet as cutoffs for small-scale jobs (Ex. 7&hyph;95 and
Tr. 3468). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Charles Kelly of Edison Electric Institute asked whether complete removal of a pipe which might exceed 21 feet in length,
but which involved removal of less than 2 feet of insulation at either end to enable cutting the pipe length for removal
would be considered a small-scale job (Ex. 156). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many additional commentators and hearing participants discussed these issues during this rulemaking proceeding.
Some commented that the duration cutoffs were not realistic or protective. Other participants asked for clarification
on whether duration of the job included preparation and cleanup. Also, Captain John Collins of the US Navy felt that
employers would abuse the exemption by assigning many employees to a job in order to complete it in a short time period
(Ex. 7&hyph;52), and suggested that instead of specifying the number of persons and the number of hours, OSHA should
set the limit in terms of man-hours [see also Churchill at Tr. 3468, ORC at Tr. 3181, Kynock of AIR Coalition (Tr. 3539)].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Daniel Bart of GTE Service Corporation expressed concern that by having a time limitation for small-scale, short
duration operations in the definition, the installation of telephone cables in buildings might no longer be considered
short duration (Ex. 7&hyph;87). Dr. Michael Crane of Consolidated Edison, New York objected to the requirement that
an operation be non-repetitive in order to qualify as small-scale, short duration (Ex. 7&hyph;76). He said, ``(t)here
are jobs *&blank;*&blank;* not part of an overall asbestos removal but are performed many times in the course of day
during routine maintenance that must be done in generation stations and other utility facilities'' [see also the
suggestion of Paul Heffernan of Kaselaan &amp; D'Angelo to adopt the concept of ``functional space'' as designated
under AHERA, and defining a non-repetitive operation as occurring once within such a functional space (Ex. 7&hyph;36)].
Some also asked if OSHA intended preparation time and clean-up time be included in the duration limits for SSSD (Ex.
7&hyph;108).

Several participants noted that most asbestos work would not be assigned to a single worker, and SSSD should include
only jobs completed by 2 employees in one work shift (Ex. 7&hyph;31): Preston Quirk of Gobbell Hays Partners, Inc.
suggested that a maximum of 3 workers be allowed (Ex. 7&hyph;34). Organization Resources Counselors, Inc. (ORC)
maintained that the specification of the number of workers was not necessary, as long as the employer had a comprehensive
safety and health plan. (Ex. 7&hyph;99). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The views on these defining variables has influenced the Agency's decision to broaden and realign its job classification
system based on relative risk. Based on this record and the agency's experience in enforcing the 1986 standard's provisions
on small-scale, short duration work, OSHA is dropping the term ``small-scale, short term'' work from the regulatory
text. The agency finds that the term ``small-scale, short term'' is too limiting, has been shown to be confusing, and
cannot be defined with sufficient precision to serve the purpose of distinguishing high risk asbestos-disturbing
activity from activity of reduced risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term is limiting because it focuses on a fraction of the circumstances and criteria which define lower risk work
with asbestos-containing material. OSHA has found that thermal system insulation (TSI) and surfacing material
are the asbestos-containing building materials likely to produce significant employee exposure. On the other hand,
removing asbestos-containing products like transite panels, likely will not result in significant exposure, even
if conducted for more than one day, under minimum controls. As much as the scope and duration of the job, the materials
themselves, their condition and the work-practices used define hazard potential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's organization of asbestos jobs into categories is based on the more objective criteria, such as the type of material
to be disturbed and the type of activity. Factors which are more subjective, such as condition, and crew experience
are part of the required pre-job assessment by a ``competent person.'' Not concentrating on the amount of asbestos
material or the time the job takes, avoids serious objections raised by rulemaking participants to the time- or volume-based
definition in the proposal. For example, a frequent complaint was that the duration of the operation should not be
specified in the definition of small-scale activities because this might create incentives to perform the work more
hurriedly and in a more hazardous manner when the worker must meet defined time schedules (Ex. 7&hyph;18, 7&hyph;35,
7&hyph;37, 7&hyph;43, 7&hyph;50, 7&hyph;52, 7&hyph;54, 7&hyph;63, 7&hyph;74, 7&hyph;76, 7&hyph;81, 7&hyph;87,
7&hyph;89, 7&hyph;95, 7&hyph;99, 7&hyph;106, 7&hyph;112, 7&hyph;124, 7&hyph;128, 7&hyph;135, 7&hyph;139,
7&hyph;146, 7&hyph;151, 143, Tr. 417). (In a few regulatory provisions, however, OSHA still relies on the amount
of material to be removed to indicate risk, and thus, the protections required. These are the exemption from critical
barriers from low-exposure Class I jobs [see paragraph (g)(4) and in defining ``disturbance'']). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This classification system is OSHA's response to the Court's remand issue of how to clarify the term ``small-scale,
short duration.'' (see also preceding discussion of classes of asbestos work under ``Definitions.'')

Class I Work
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Class I work, i.e., the ``removal'' of TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM, must be performed using procedures in paragraph
(g)(4) and using a control method which is listed in paragraph (g)(5) of the standard. If another control method is
used, or if a listed control method is ``modified,'' the standard in paragraph (g)(6) requires that a certified industrial
hygienist (CIH), or licensed professional engineer who is a ``project designer,'' certify the control method using
the criteria set out in the regulatory text. The requirements of (g)(4) are: for Class I jobs, preparation must be supervised
by a competent person, dropcloths must be used and HVAC systems must be isolated. The area must be set up using ``critical
barriers' either as part of a negative pressure enclosure system, or as a supplemental barrier to another listed system
which isolates the asbestos disturbance in a different way. Other barriers or isolation methods may be used to prevent
asbestos migration. The effectiveness of such methods must be proven by visual inspection and clearance or perimeter
monitoring (see e.g., Ex. 9&hyph;34 cc). As noted below, OSHA believes that the size of the removal job alone does not
predict the risk to workers. However, if a job is smaller, the chances are reduced that isolation barriers provided
by glove bags or boxes will fail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA was reluctant to limit glove bag removals without critical barriers only to maintenance projects, where as NIOSH
noted, it is more likely that crews will be untrained (Ex. 125). Rather, OSHA has followed the lead of some states, which
allow removals involving less than 25 linear feet of TSI, and 10 square feet of other material to be handled without
critical barriers, unless the glove bags or enclosure loses its integrity (see e.g., 12 NYCRR 56) or where a negative
exposure assessment has not been produced. Such projects are class I removals, and workers required to perform them
must be trained in an EPA-accredited training course or equivalent; OSHA believes that the work force performing
these relatively minor removals is the same work force performing major removals, thus the jobs will be well-conducted
and critical barriers will be unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, where the employer cannot demonstrate that a Class I job is likely not to overexpose employees, the employer
must ventilate the regulated area to move contaminated air away from employee breathing zones. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(5) sets out five listed control methods which OSHA has evaluated during this rulemaking. The Agency
finds that using these methods pursuant to the limitations and specifications in the paragraph is likely to effectively
control employee exposures when performing Class I work. The first control system listed for Class I work is the Negative
Pressure Enclosure System (or NPE). The extent to which OSHA should require these systems for major asbestos work
was a remanded issue. As discussed in detail below, OSHA has found that NPEs, when constructed and used according to
the criteria in this standard, can be effective in protecting employees within and outside the enclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other listed systems also may be used for Class I work under stated limitations. Paragraph (g)(5) sets out these limitations.
These systems are: glove bag systems, negative-pressure glove bag systems, negative pressure glove box systems,
the water spray process system, and a mini-enclosure system. OSHA emphasizes the use of the term ``system.'' Each
method consists of tangible materials and devices; and of procedures and practices. All the listed elements must
be complied with before OSHA's finding of effectiveness are relevant. Other, unspecified control methods, ``alternative
control methods,'' may be used if additional notification is given OSHA, and if a specially trained ``project designer''
or a certified industrial hygienist certifies that the controls will be protective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants in this rulemaking requested that OSHA's revisions allow alternative systems. OSHA agrees that asbestos
removal technology is evolving. If another control method is used, or if a listed control method is ``modified,''
the standard requires that a certified industrial hygienist or licensed professional engineer who is also qualified
as a project designer certify the control method using the criteria set out in the regulatory text. Additional discussion
of these issues is found later in this document.

Specific Issues Relating to Methods of Compliance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. A major issue in this proceeding is when NPEs should be required. In the 1990 proposal OSHA would have required the
erection of negative pressure enclosures for all asbestos removal jobs, except for ``small scale short duration
work.'' This proposal responded to the Court's order for OSHA to clarify the conditions under which negative pressure
enclosures were required in the 1986 standard (see discussion on Issue 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major rationale in the 1986 standard for requiring negative pressure enclosures was to ensure that contamination
from large-scale asbestos projects did not spread beyond the work area. OSHA there stated that ``general contamination
of the workplace has resulted from failure to confine asbestos using strict regulated area procedures, and asbestos-related
diseases have been found in workers of a different trade exposed to asbestos contamination from the activities of
asbestos workers.'' (55 FR at 29716). The effectiveness of NPEs in protecting employees working within the enclosure
was not the explicit basis for their adoption in the 1986 rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1990 proposal, OSHA primarily based the requirement for universal NPEs for major asbestos work on limited data
relating to contamination of workspaces adjacent to asbestos work, and reports of historic disease experienced
by employers in trades other than asbestos work who worked alongside asbestos workers. OSHA stated however, that
the Agency ``has not been able to estimate the risk to bystander employees *&blank;*&blank;*'' and asked for comment
and data on their exposure (55 FR 29716). OSHA also asked for information about alternatives to work in full containment,
such as glove bag and box systems and ``new technologies'' (55 FR 29717). Although OSHA proposed more tightly drawn
exemptions to the required use of negative pressure enclosures, the Agency also raised the possibility that data
to be submitted about alternative control systems might result in a limitation, rather than an expansion of the walk-in
enclosure requirements (55 FR 29720).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further the 1990 proposal specifically focused on whether work within walk-in enclosures was the optimum method
to protect asbestos workers. It is widely accepted that employees who disturb asbestos, and who contact deteriorated
asbestos during their work are most at risk (see e.g., Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 1&hyph;12). In its earlier response to the
Court's remand, OSHA noted that the ``record of the 1986 standard contains no data concerning whether employees working
within the negative pressure enclosures also benefit from reduced exposure, whether working inside enclosures
may introduce other potential work hazards such as heat stress. Further rulemaking is necessary to develop this information.''
(54 FR 52026, Dec. 20, 1989). In the proposal, OSHA reiterated this statement and again raised this issue (55 FR 29715).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rulemaking record reflected this two-part inquiry. Data and comment were submitted concerning the effectiveness
of NPEs in protecting employees within the enclosure, and their effectiveness in protecting ``bystander'' employees
and adjacent areas from asbestos contamination. The record presents a mixed case on both issues. First, very limited
data were submitted showing that employees working within the enclosures experienced reduced asbestos levels because
of the enclosures themselves, or the ventilation provided by negative air machines, in spite of claims that the enclosures
and ventilation produce such results. In fact claims were made that in comparing work within enclosures to work without
enclosures, ``enclosures consistently came out higher in terms of what the person inside the enclosure is exposed
to'' (Exxon, Tr. 2678). However, the record contains some data which show that properly designed and installed NPEs
may limit the spread of asbestos contamination to adjacent areas and employees. However, the record also demonstrates
that other systems, properly installed and performed by trained employees will also limit the spread of asbestos
contamination. These are discussed in depth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this record and on the Agency's experience and expertise, OSHA has concluded that although negative pressure
enclosure systems are effective in many circumstances in protecting workers both within and outside the enclosure,
other systems are equally effective in designated circumstances. Additionally, the demonstration in this rulemaking
that other systems can be effective, supports regulatory provisions which do not stifle continued development and
refinement of control strategies for asbestos work.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Effectiveness of NPEs in Protecting Employees Working Within the Enclosure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, little data were submitted showing that employees working within the enclosure have reduced exposures
because of the enclosure itself, or other components of the NPE system. Although much data was alluded to during the
hearing, e.g., ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;10 years of real, real projects with rooms full of data, *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;we
have some nice summaries that I can give you *&blank;*&blank;*.''(Tr. 3133). However, none of these data was submitted
to the record. Also, NIOSH testified during the rulemaking hearing, ``we are not aware of any studies evaluating their
(negative pressure enclosures) effectiveness or delineating important parameters such as minimum pressure differential,
minimum air flow, or maximum volumes feasible for various barrier materials.'' (Tr. 228). BCTD noted a study in which
``two MIT researchers estimated ``that total exposures using the HEPA negative pressure system might be about four-fold
less than they would be without the system'' (Ex. 143 at 90). OSHA notes that this estimate was derived from ``assumptions''
of the study team, and was unsupported by exposure data. Further, the baseline exposure model was based on a much earlier
study of activities cleaning up contamination in a building. During this rulemaking hearing, the author of that study
described it as ``extremely unique,&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;not representative of buildings in the United
States'' (Tr. 2157). OSHA therefore regards the MIT exposure reduction estimate as unsupported and too speculative
to serve as a basis for regulatory decision making. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exposure data submitted to this rulemaking record which reflected personal samples within negative pressure enclosures
do not support the view that working within such enclosures by itself will ensure reduced employee exposure. In fact,
data were submitted which showed that employees working within negative pressure enclosures under some circumstances
were exposed to excessive levels of asbestos (see below). OSHA recognizes that a showing of elevated levels from any
one project or series of projects does not indict the control method as the cause of such elevations. However, numerous
submissions from various sources which show elevated exposure levels with no indication of improper system installation
indicates that in operation, the use of negative pressure enclosure systems does not assure effective exposure reduction
to the employees performing the work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, Union Carbide submitted 1,000 exposure measurements ``generally obtained from jobs where insulation was
removed from piping of 1

<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; -14

&rsquo; diameter and from other miscellaneous jobs removing asbestos from vessels'' (Ex. 7&hyph;108). More than
one half of the samples were over the proposed PEL of 0.1 f/cc, and most of those were over the previous PEL of 0.2 f/cc.
Additional data showing high exposures within negative pressure enclosures compared to relatively low exposure
levels for glove bag use were submitted by Arco Products, Inc. (Ex. 7&hyph;139) and Grayling (7&hyph;144). The Arco
submission contained monitoring results from 9 personal samples taken within the enclosure. These ranged from 0.01
to 0.44 f/cc with a mean on 0.28 f/cc. Lower exposure levels for work within NPEs was shown by data submitted by the Asbestos
Abatement Council, presenting data incorporating air monitoring results for over 200 projects, collected from
four different contractors over an eight year time period. These data showed area samples ranging from 0.12 to 0.15
f/cc, while personal samples ranged from 0.03 to 0.07 f/cc (Ex. 1&hyph;142).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Various reasons were advanced for the presence of elevated exposure levels within negative pressure enclosures.
Thus Dr. Sawyer testified ``I have seen configurations that not only don't work maintaining the enclosure integrity,
but they actually can increase fiber burdens in the contamination area *&blank;*&blank;* (t)his involves *&blank;*&blank;*
a HEPA filter by itself without a drive mechanism, without a fan to force air through it'' (Tr. 2176). ``I can anecdotally
tell you what I've seen out there, but a lot of the systems just don't work, and some of them can actually increase the
hazard to workers'' (Id at 2177&hyph;78). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the disparity in the submitted data, OSHA concludes that negative pressure enclosure systems, like other
control systems which depend on proper installation, design and supervision for effectiveness, can vary in protection
they afford to employees working within. Unlike engineering systems permanently installed which are capitalized
by the facility owner, negative pressure systems are installed for the duration of the job, and economic pressures
are exerted to hold down the time and cost of the installation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the support for the use of NPEs to reduce employee exposure is mixed. OSHA is also concerned that other health
and safety hazards may result from work in negative pressure enclosure systems. For example, problems with toxic
adhesives were noted in the record. Levels of methylene chloride, used to seal poly sheeting to underlying surfaces
to contain work areas have been measured at over the PEL for that substance (Ex. 1&hyph;24). Some of the polyethylene
used for sheeting may be combustible (Ex. 7&hyph;18). Certain industries reported particular hazards of NPEs. For
example, a representative of Arco Products Co. commented that in the gasoline industry hazards included: build-up
of gases inside the enclosure, heat stress, fire hazards, lack of good ventilation, difficulty in working with mobile
equipment, difficulties in communicating and exiting during emergencies (Ex. 7&hyph;139). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various solutions to these problem were suggested. Thus, it was suggested that less toxic adhesives be substituted
for methylene chloride; that poly sheets can be attached without adhesives (BCTD, Ex. 143); that heat stress be eliminated
by increasing the number of air changes per hour within the enclosure; that a transparent window be installed in each
enclosure to facilitate communication (Ex. 7&hyph;6); and other such adaptations. Certain of these suggestions
were criticized as ineffective. For example, Union Carbide stated in its post-hearing submission, ``(w)e have observed
that even when 8 to 12 air changes per hour are provided to the enclosure, on certain days the inside of the enclosure
temperature has risen as high as 140 degrees F. The heat stress situation is further exacerbated by the body coveralls
worn by the workers'' (Ex. 113 p. 6).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes that some of these potential problems attributable to negative pressure enclosures may be averted.
However, the record also indicates that the use of this control technique shares with other asbestos control methods,
a primary reliance upon the skill and training of designers and workers to assure its effectiveness. In addition,
under some circumstances even the proper use of negative pressure enclosures can introduce additional hazards into
the workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One feature of some negative pressure enclosure systems, negative air ventilation, was singled out by some participants
as the primary means of reducing exposures to employees working within them. OSHA notes however, that the requirement
for NPEs as adopted in the 1986 rule, did not contain any criteria for such ventilation, and that the rationale for requiring
NPEs did not rest on the capability of ventilation to reduce employee exposure. Therefore, OSHA regards the recommendation
for requiring special ventilation as a new claim, to be supported by evidence and testimony submitted to this record.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the main characteristics of the negative pressure enclosure system is that the air pressure inside the enclosure
is less than outside the enclosure. This pressure difference is created by a fan exhausting air, through a filter,
from inside the enclosure to outside the enclosure. Under negative pressure, any leaks in the walls of the enclosure
will result in clean air coming into the enclosure, rather than contaminated air leaking to the outside. The system
is primarily designed to keep asbestos from contaminating the building. As stated earlier, this approach does not
appear to improve working conditions inside the enclosure. Negative air ventilation draws clean air from outside
the enclosure at sufficient quantities and at strategic locations, so as to provide clean air in the worker's breathing
zone. Support for negative air ventilation was submitted by numerous participants. For example, Mr. D'Angelo testified
that ``negative air ventilation is the single most effective engineering control reducing worker exposure as well
as reducing the risk to adjacent bystanders or other operations.'' Further, he recommended a minimum of 8 and up to
20 air changes per hour to assure appropriate ventilation is maintained (Tr. 3078, 3087). This process, ``which has
expanded on the negative pressure enclosure, (is) called air flush methodology'' (Tr. 3085). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other participants also supported the use of ``air flushing'' techniques, or directed make-up air. Chip D'Angelo,
an asbestos abatement consultant described the principle as moving airborne fibers out of the work area with air velocity,
thereby ``flushing'' the area by bringing in air from sources outside the enclosure additional to that brought through
the decontamination chamber. He further described moving the air away from the worker and toward the negative air
filtration machines and directing the moving air to ``dead spots'' in the enclosure by use of baffles and flexiducts
(Tr. 3035) (see BCTD, Ex. 143 p. 90, and citations therein). Mr. Cook, an asbestos abatement contractor, appearing
for the BCTD, testified that ``it's a fairly easy technology to implement, depending on the situation.''(Tr. 805).
Mr. Medaglia, president of an engineering firm suggested adding to the definition of a negative pressure enclosure,
the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* all areas within the enclosure are swept by the flowing air towards the exhaust fans
*&blank;*&blank;*'' (Tr. 3052). Other support was provided by New Jersey White Lung Association (Tr. 601&hyph;2),
NIOSH (Tr. 228 and 257), R. Sawyer (Tr. 2161), D. Kirby (Tr. 170), Global Consumer Services (Tr. 2341) and J. Cook of
QSI International (Tr. 804.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, some engineers who testified did not utilize the technique; Exxon noted in its testimony that ``you can't,
quite honestly, get enough volume of air velocity to convince yourself you are going to get good equal mixing within
an entire enclosure'' (Tr. 2680); and NIOSH noted in its submitted testimony, that ``we are not aware of any studies
evaluating their effectiveness (NPE's) or delineating important parameters such as *&blank;*&blank;* minimum
air flow'' (Ex. 9). NIOSH recommended that OSHA incorporate into the rule for negative-pressure enclosures, design
requirements for air-flow patterns within the enclosure to move airborne particles away from the worker'' (Ibid).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although ``air flushing'' is the ventilation approach most recommended for use within negative pressure systems,
actual data showing its success is limited. In recognition of the support from engineers who have utilized these systems,
OSHA is requiring a performance based version of ``air flushing'' as a component of the negative pressure enclosure
system. OSHA is also requiring ventilation which ``directs the air away from exposed employees'' when other controls
are used for Class I work where no there is insufficient data to support a ``negative exposure assessment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants also argued that the use of negative pressure systems under stated circumstances was unnecessary and
would not contribute to employee protection against asbestos exposure. Working outdoors was one such circumstance.
Amoco submitted data in which 95% amosite was removed from an outdoor pipe run without negative pressure enclosure
in which most samples indicated very low fiber levels (Ex. 7&hyph;39). However, the following work practices were
also used: restricted access, immediate and double bagging of debris or use of airtight chutes, barricaded area,
use of HEPA equipped vacuums, respirator, decontamination procedures, and training and supervision of the operation
by a competent person.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes that outdoor Class I work may be safely done without enclosures. Therefore, paragraph (g) allows all
outdoor Class I work to be conducted using other control methods, such as a glove bag system, so long as the specifications
and work practices for such systems are followed. In addition, decontamination procedures for all Class I work, outdoors
as well as indoors, including decontamination facilities and showers, must be made available for all Class I work,
including that performed outdoors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, the negative pressure enclosure requirement in the 1986 standard lacked specificity. BCTD recommended
that OSHA specify the number of air changes per hour required in the negative pressure enclosure (Ex. 143, p. 94). They
reasoned that this would improve ventilation within the enclosure and reduce worker exposure. Union Carbide testified
that they use 8 to 12 changes per hour (Tr. 2255) and Chip D'Angelo recommended 10 changes per hour (Ex. 99). New Jersey
White Lung Association representative suggested 8 changes per hour (Tr. 482). BCTD and others also proposed that
the negative pressure differential be increased from the recommended 0.02 column inches water in Appendix F (Ex.
143, p. 95) ``because of fluctuations inside the enclosure.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several published articles, Spicer and D'Angelo expressed their support for these recommendations and further
suggested that pressure measurements be made at several points within the enclosure (Ex. 9&hyph;34 NN, Tr. 3126).
The use of a manometer to measure the pressure differential between the enclosure and the area outside the enclosure
was also supported by BCTD and D'Angelo and Spicer primarily because this device would provide immediate notice if
there were a loss of pressure and therefore increased potential for fiber escape (Ex. 143, p. 96 and Ex. 9&hyph;34 NN).
He estimated the cost of a manometer at $20.00 (Tr. 3078). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BCTD submitted additional recommendations which it felt would improve negative pressure enclosure use:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of these recommendations appear to be beneficial. Requiring smoke testing to detect leaks is adopted by the Agency
as part of required set-up procedures when such enclosures are used. Others, such as requiring ``additional air filtration
machines&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;where exposures are especially high'' appear to be sound engineering
advice but would present enforcement problems, if included in the regulatory text (Ex. 143). Instead, as part of the
mandatory criteria for NPEs, when used to control exposure in Class I jobs, the Agency is requiring ``competent persons''
to oversee the installation of such systems, and employees to be protected within such enclosures by ventilation
systems which minimize their asbestos exposure. OSHA believes that its provisions on negative pressure systems
will protect employees working within them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above extensive analysis of the many studies and comments, OSHA has concluded that NPEs are not appropriate
as a universal requirement. They usually protect bystanders well, but not always workers within the enclosures,
and can sometimes create other problems. Consequently, OSHA is permitting alternatives to NPEs in appropriate circumstances
and is upgrading requirements for NPEs when they are used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, OSHA believes that various alternative requirements in this final revised standard triggered by Class I, II,
and III work, some of which are components of negative pressure systems will protect adjacent or ``bystander'' employees
under most situations. Thus, mandatory critical barriers for most Class I, some Class II and III work will bar passage
of fugitive asbestos fibers; and, clarifying the responsibilities of the various employers on a multi-employer
worksite, paragraph (d) will protect

3. What Other Control Systems Can be Allowed for Asbestos Work Which Involves High Risk Materials? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA is allowing other control systems for Category I asbestos work, but only under stated conditions. Thus, the second
asbestos control system permitted for use for Category I asbestos work is a glove bag system which meets the requirements
of the standard, and is used only in the limited situations listed in paragraph (g), i.e. straight runs of piping and
to remove intact TSI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other technologies recommended by the accredited project designer or competent person based on supporting data
showing their effectiveness may also be used. Whenever a technology is used which is not referenced in the standards,
the employer must notify OSHA before the asbestos job, and include in the notification the basis for the project designer's
or certified industrial hygienist's decision that the new technology will be equally effective as other technologies
referenced in the appendix. Daily personal and periphery area monitoring must be conducted for all such jobs, as well
as clearance samples at the termination of the abatement job.

Glove Bag Systems

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The decision to allow increased glove bag use is based on the considerable comment and evidence submitted during this
proceeding concerning the safety and effectiveness of glove bag use. OSHA had proposed to permit only small-scale,
short duration removals to be conducted using glove bags; however the Agency noted that it was considering whether
alternatives, including glove bags, to negative pressure enclosures for renovation, removal and demolition operations
should be allowed (55 FR at 29716). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1986 standard, glove bag effectiveness was considered too uncertain to allow as a preferred control. Therefore
OSHA relegated glove bag use to small-scale, short duration jobs, or jobs exempt from the negative pressure enclosure
requirement because of the configuration of the work environment. However OSHA noted that glove bag use could generally
be expected to reduce exposures to below 0.1 f/cc (51 FR 22711). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to its proposed amendments the Agency noted that available data indicated that glove bags in use may
not always provide adequate protection. In large part, the Agency based this preliminary evaluation on the results
of an evaluation performed by NIOSH in which improperly used glove bags resulted in excessive fiber counts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, this final construction standard expands the conditions in which glove bag use is allowed. Now, glove
bag use for removal of TSI and surfacing ACM is allowed without quantity limitation for intact TSI for straight runs
of piping.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes these decisions are well supported by this rulemaking record. Many participants urged OSHA to expand
the conditions for permitting glove bag use. For example the Dow Chemical Company stated, ``removal of asbestos containing
material from pipes or pipelines can best be accomplished with the use of glove bags in all instances, not just when
pipes are elevated. Needless to say, the employees carrying out the operation must be trained and adequately supervised
to the glove bags properly.'' (Ex. 7&hyph;103). The American Paper Institute and the National Forest Products Association
stated that ``(w)e fully agree with the field personnel that there should be no linear footage limit for the removal
of asbestos insulation on pipe when proper glove bag techniques are used'' (Ex. 7&hyph;74 at 9). The National Insulation
and Abatement Contractors Association commented ``(a) skilled asbestos abatement mechanic can certainly remove
in excess of 21 linear feet in properly used glove bags in as safe a manner as he or she can less than 21 feet.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;(i)n
addition, the implied restriction against glove bag use outside of small-scale, short-duration work ignores the
advances made in glove bag practices and worker skills'' (Ex 7&hyph;72 at 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Vest of the U.S. Air Force commented: ``(t)he regulation should clearly allow for *&blank;*&blank;* operations
that are not small-scale, short duration but are also not within the purview of the full requirements for a regulated
area. We believe multiple glove bag operations would fall into this category; this in-between category should require
training and additional procedures, but not necessarily ``negative pressure enclosures.'' James Snyder, representing
the American Paper Institute, maintained that there should be no linear limit as long as proper glove bag techniques
were used (Ex. 7&hyph;74). Exhibits 7&hyph;9, 7&hyph;19, 7&hyph;21, 7&hyph;26, 7&hyph;32, 7&hyph;33, 7&hyph;50,
7&hyph;63, 7&hyph;72, 7&hyph;73, 7&hyph;74, 7&hyph;76, 7&hyph;95, 7&hyph;99, 7&hyph;102, 7&hyph;103, 7&hyph;106,
7&hyph;107, 7&hyph;120, 7&hyph;121, 7&hyph;125, 7&hyph;128, 7&hyph;130, 7&hyph;139, 7&hyph;144, and 7&hyph;146
also supported expanded glove bag use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, to these generalized statements of support for expanded use of glove bags, participants submitted data
to show the effectiveness of glove bags in protecting workers. For example, the U.S. Air Force, introduced data (Ex.
3&hyph;9). The large majority of measurement were below 0.1 f/cc. Only 54 of the 370 measurements sets were over 0.1
f/cc, some of which were within the sampling and analytical error margin of 25%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Vernon Rose of the University of Alabama at Birmingham submitted a paper entitled: ``Analysis of PCM asbestos
air monitoring results for a major abatement project'' (Ex. 7&hyph;194), in which over 2000 sampling results were
presented, taken over a five year period during which thermal system insulation was removed from a single building.
This study provides very extensive data on closely observed work which the authors described as ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;ideal
conditions existed to support the proper abatement of ACM'' (Ex. 7&hyph;194). However, they also noted that the environment
was generally quite dusty and that since the results were PCM counts, they might overestimate the true exposure level.
The results are summarized Table I.

Additional data were submitted by Grayling Industries and Control Resource Systems, Inc., glove bag manufacturers
(Ex. 7&hyph;144). Personal breathing zone measurements representing varied removals are almost all below OSHA's
proposed PEL of 0.1 f/cc. After the hearing, Grayling submitted letters from some of the contractors and organizations
in charge of the projects for which data was submitted, which detailed the procedures followed by employees during
the jobs where low exposure levels were recorded. (Ex. 111). These conditions correspond to the specifications and
work practices which OSHA is requiring in this standard for glove bag use.

Virtually all of the participants who opposed expanded use of glove bags for removal jobs, cited the NIOSH study referred
to above. (See e.g. Ex. 143 at 98&hyph;100). The study was conducted jointly by NIOSH and EPA in 1985, and its results
were made public, as a Health Hazard Evaluation (Exs. 1&hyph;1, 1&hyph;2, 1&hyph;20). It has also formed the basis
for NIOSH's institutional position on glove bags published as ``An Evaluation Glove Bag Containment in Asbestos
Removal'' in October 1990. (submitted post-hearing as Ex. 125). Based on the data and analysis in that document, NIOSH's
spokesperson, Richard Lemen testified at the rulemaking hearing:

NIOSH has found that airborne fibers are released in the work place when glove bags are used to remove asbestos pipe.
Although the reasons for these releases were not determined, the study indicated that glove bags did not control asbestos
exposures as anticipated. Thus, NIOSH strongly supports OSHA in requiring that negative-pressure enclosures be
used in conjunction with glove bags. Furthermore, NIOSH recommends that OSHA require the use of respiratory protection
when glove bags are used. At a minimum, NIOSH recommends that workers should be required to wear the most protective
air-purifying respirators&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* (Tr. 229)

The study evaluated the removal of asbestos containing pipe lagging using glove bags from four public school buildings.
The data were obtained during week-long surveys in each of the buildings. According to the abstract in the evaluation:
``the same work crew removed asbestos-containing pipe lagging in all four schools. Personal exposures to airborne
fibers were determined using the NIOSH method'' (Ex. 125). NIOSH summarized the results: ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;In
three of the four facilities studied, workers were exposed to airborne asbestos concentrations above the OSHA PEL.
Only in the last building where the removal took place, were exposure levels reduced to below the new OSHA PELs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interpretation of the results of this study varied. BCTD viewed the study as supporting its view that glove bags should
not be permitted for other than small scale, short duration jobs because they do not provide reliable protection for
bystanders. (Ex. 143, p. 98). HEI concluded, based on the NIOSH study, that ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;glove bags
should never be used as a stand alone abatement isolation procedure for long pipe runs'' (HEI, Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 5&hyph;48).
Clearly these results call into question any expansion of permitted glove bag use. However, after paying close attention
to the conditions, personnel and equipment utilized in the NIOSH study, and to the rest of the record, OSHA believes
that glove bag systems, when properly deployed and supplemented by barriers, are capable of protecting both the abatement
worker and bystander employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Details of the improper usage in the NIOSH study were pointed out by Grayling and CI and by the NIOSH investigators themselves;
``the methods employed by workers&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;violated current state-of the art glove bag
procedures&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;(t)he glove bags contained over four times the recommended material,
they were opened up and slid down the pipe, *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;(t)hey were used as a receptacle rather than
as a glove bag, *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;the envelope was slit to speed the removal process, *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;bags
were being sealed while removal was taking place&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' and other improper procedures (Ex.
130, Ex. 125). In addition, although NIOSH noted ``[w]orker training and experience are important components in
a reliable system of control measure, *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;(in this study) the work crew was not trained in the
proper use of glove bags'' (Ex. 125, p. 20). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Representatives of the glove bag industry also noted that since the study was undertaken in 1985&hyph;86, the equipment
used by the workers, has been replaced by better designed and more protective equipment and materials. For example,
one of the glove bags used in the study employed a zippered connection system, which ``promote(s) the free flow of contaminated
air from the glove bag during removal&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*,'' and the ``one-size fits all'' glove bag has been
replaced by a ``greater number of designs and configurations of glove bags&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;(for)
T's, elbows, valves, verticals and extended runs'' (Ex. 130, p. 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study showed that by the time the removal activity reached the fourth (final) building, the work crew, having been
``trained'' by a variety of on-the-job methods, such as ``trial and error,'' advice from the survey team, and watching
a videotape, exposure levels were dramatically reduced. The pre-removal levels were not lower at the final facility,
approximately the same amount of asbestos was removed as in the other operations and the authors stated that the lagging
was in generally good condition throughout the study_lending further credence to the hypothesis that the use of improved
work practices led to generation of lower fiber levels. The report concluded with a list of recommendations for work
practices for glove bag use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the NIOSH study should be viewed as a demonstration of poor work practices by untrained employees.
The Agency notes that although the NIOSH study contains carefully presented and analyzed exposure data, the study
design was compromised by the intervention of the investigators in instructing the workers. Further, since the workers
were untrained, and for the most part did not use the glove bags correctly to attempt to isolate the disturbances, the
study is of limited utility in identifying problems of glove bag systems when they are used correctly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIOSH speculated that ignorance of proper glove bag procedures was common for plant maintenance personnel, asbestos
operations and maintenance personnel, and many asbestos removal contractors who use glove bags only occasionally''
(Ex. 125, p. 53). If indeed this is so, it suggests that short of prohibiting glove-bag removals entirely, restricting
permitted usage to, for example, maintenance work (small-scale, short-duration work) may result in limiting permitted
glove bag work to where it is likely to be performed incorrectly. It also suggests that, the frequency of glove bag work,
rather than the size of the removal project is more relevant to its effectiveness. Other participants echoed this
caution, for example, David Kirby of Oak Ridge National Laboratory testified that glove bag usage should be conditioned
on showing quarterly frequency of glove bag usage (Tr. 116&hyph;17).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA concludes that when conscientiously used by well-trained, well-supervised personnel, glove bags can effectively
reduce asbestos fiber release. The NIOSH study demonstrated clearly that the obverse is also true; when glove bags
are used improperly by untrained or insufficiently trained workers, airborne fiber levels can become significantly
elevated. Consequently, based on this extensive evidence and analysis, OSHA is permitting wider use of glove bag
technology in the final standard, but is including additional requirements to improve the effectiveness of their
use. The Agency notes that the new regulatory text prescribing the specifications and work practices for allowable
glove bag removals would prohibit the kind of removal activity observed in the NIOSH study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its study, NIOSH recommended detailed work practices and specifications for glove bag use. OSHA has incorporated
the major recommendations into the standard, either as part of the overall requirements for asbestos removal, or
as required components of permitted glove bag systems. For example, NIOSH recommends that workers ``spray frequently
during the removal process so that newly exposed surfaces are wetted.'' OSHA requires that all work be performed using
wet methods. ``Wet methods'' are defined as, applying sufficient water to ACM and PACM during the work operation so
that fibers, if released, are prevented from becoming airborne. Other recommendations likewise are covered by more
generic requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Class I work in which glove bags are used, OSHA is requiring that 2 persons perform the glove bag removal. BCTD recommended
that 2 persons perform glove bag work stating that ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;the operation can be hard-pressed
to adjust the HEPA vacuum flow rates or water pressure in the sprayer while his/her hands are in the bag'' (Ex. 143, p.
125). BCTD also felt that proper decontamination required a ``buddy system'' involving a second worker.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exxon representative, Mr. Booher, testified that their practices is to have 2 persons per glove bag (Tr. 2673). Mr.
Sledge of Naval Sea Systems Command testified that two personal normally perform glove bag operations in their facilities,
usually using glove bags under negative pressure (Tr. 420). OSHA agrees and believes that proper use of glove bags
in removing high-risk ACM (TSI and surfacing ACM) requires at least two persons. The Agency also notes that required
training of employees must cover detailed glove bag procedures. Many of the detailed work practices recommended
by NIOSH are advisory, i.e. use ``sprayer of sufficient length,'' will be covered in training, and/or are encompassed
by more general requirements.

Although glove bag systems were the alternative system most discussed during the rulemaking, participants submitted
data on other systems which were claimed to effectively isolate asbestos dust during removal. The Agency has reviewed
the data and comment on these submissions and has listed four additional systems as permitted for Class I work under
stated circumstances in paragraph (g)(5). The Agency emphasizes that the listing of any system is not an endorsement
by OSHA. The listing merely indicates that various combinations of engineering controls and work practices represented
by these systems, when properly carried out, and when all other provisions of these standards, e.g., training, competent
person supervision, exposure assessments and respirator use where required, are found by the Agency on this record
to constitute effective means of controlling employee exposure to asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two of the systems are modifications of glove bag systems. One, a negative pressure glove bag system, was presented
as an alternative by several participants. One witness stated that ``the nuclear ship repair industry has used pipe
containment glove bags for years&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;all of this work has been required to be performed
with constant negative pressure being maintained inside the glove bag during removal operations'' (Tr. 3028). A
panel testifying on behalf of Union Carbide described a negative-pressure glove bag technology which they have developed
(Tr. 2192 and Ex. 7&hyph;108). M. Patel, an industrial hygienist at Union Carbide, described it in his written testimony:

The glove bag system is used as follows: The glove bag is connected to the glove/hose connector. All the tools needed
to remove asbestos are placed in the inner pouch of the glove bag. The bag is installed on a pipe utilizing the zipper
provided at the top. The shoulder is fastened on both ends of the glove bag with tourniquets. The rest of the system is
connected. The insulation is wetted with amended water using the portable garden sprayer. The asbestos is cut and
falls through the open sliding gate valve and collects in the waste bag. Vacuum in the bag and in the rest of the system
is adjusted to prevent collapse of the bag. When the asbestos waste collected in the bag is almost full, the sliding
gate valve is closed as the vacuum in the system is slowly controlled by adjusting the splitter valve, and the bag is
carefully sealed and removed. A new bag is installed and the sliding gate valve opened. When all asbestos inside the
glove bag is removed, the pipe and the wall of the glove bag above the middle zipper inside the bag are rinsed with amended
water. The middle zipper is closed to isolate the upper compartment while vacuum is still being pulled.

In a post-hearing submission, Union Carbide submitted a large number of additional measurements from various operations
supporting the relative effectiveness of their negative-pressure glove bag method of asbestos control. These data
showed both glove bags and negative pressure glove bag personal exposure levels were low, and well below those for
negative pressure enclosures as measured by the company.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Some of the exposure monitoring results showed personal samples above the new PEL of 0.1 f/cc. Union Carbide suggested,
that employees performing Class I work using the modified negative pressure glove-bag, wear respiratory protection.
OSHA is requiring that all employees who perform Class I work wear respirators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional data on negative pressure glove bags showing effective exposure reductions was submitted by others,
including NIOSH (Ex. 1&hyph;125, 1&hyph;126). ``Opinion evidence'' was that negative pressure glove bags, when
properly used, offered an additional margin of safety over non-negative pressure glove bags (see e.g., testimony
of David Kirby, Tr. 188). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these data, OSHA is allowing negative pressure glove bags for Class I work, subject to similar limitations
as ``regular'' glove bags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another method allowed for Class I work is the negative pressure glove box. This isolation device, is a rigid containment,
unlike the glove bag, which is made of flexible material. Because it can be constructed of strong, impermeable material,
common glove bag failures due to holes, leaks and collapse, would theoretically be avoided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mark Mazzara of SDS International Builders submitted several documents describing a negative pressure glove box,
which his firm was marketing. The accompanying brochures described it as follows:

the creation of the pressure barrier that allows the creation of the closed system, preventing the escape of hazards
materials into surrounding area (Ex. 7&hyph;98).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The submissions contained numerous sampling results indicating that low fiber levels were maintained during the
use of this device. Accompanying these was a letter from the State of New Jersey in which the Division of Building and
Construction (Frank J. Kuzniacki) stated that he felt that the device ``provided a safe and cost effective alternative
to standard glove bag removal.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The last method specifically listed for Class I use is designated the ``water spray'' process. In submissions to the
docket and in testimony at the public hearing, representatives of Hydrous Dust Control Systems, Inc. described an
alternate method of control for use in work on asbestos covered pipes which they called the Portam Process. This process
relies on water spray to provide a barrier between the worker and the ACM. In written materials it was described as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Engineered designed sprays are configured so as to create a liquid barrier on every plane. The spray is so designed
as to throw a heavy droplet of liquid giving it both velocity and direction. On at least one of these planes *&blank;*&blank;*
the heavy water droplets are forced into collision creating a very fine aerosol which is contained within liquid barriers.
A water containment device is placed around the spray rails with an open access and double drain facility. A vacuum
hose is connected to the drain facility creating a slight pressure differential (negative pressure), in the contained
area. When water covers the drain area the pressure differential is maximized in the drain hose pulling the waste and
water very rapidly to the remote interceptor. This movement creates a shock pulse which is quite visual and is reflected
at the workhead. The sudden movement of air within the work zone helps to stimulated the fine aerosol droplets creating
eddy current. These eddy currents promote a 360
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; precipitation around the pipe (Ex. 1&hyph;171).

Data were presented showing that use of this system achieved consistently low exposure levels. However, the complexity
of the system, and its uniqueness require, as the manufacturer recommends, additional training for effective use.
Therefore OSHA is allowing this system to be used only by workers who are trained in a supplemental 40 hour training
course in the specific use of this system, including at least 8 hours of which must be hands-on training. Although BCTD
stated that this system possessed a high potential for exposure because it is not a sealed system, (Ex. 143, at 103),
OSHA believes that the technology of the water spray system is sufficiently proven by the data submitted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Other specific systems which do not easily fit the descriptions of the above systems were discussed during the rulemaking.
Some, such as the ``Lyons Trough'' appear promising, however, the data submitted are too limited for OSHA to determine
effectiveness in the rulemaking. Several TEM and PCM measurements were made during a ``controlled demonstration''
which lasted 31 minutes and during ``field evaluation'' of 29 minutes. The personal sample from the former was below
the limit of detection by PCM, and the personal sample from the latter measured 0.002 f/cc by PCM (Ex. 135). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other methods appeared too limited in application to be ``generically'' approved by OSHA, and/or appeared highly
dependent on worker behavior to avoid failure. Such a system, devised by Tenneco, is a modified glove bag/mini-enclosure
to facilitate safe removal of small amounts of asbestos fireproofing above ceiling tiles (Ex. 65 A&hyph;P). In its
post-hearing brief, the BCTD objected to the use of the Tenneco device for two reasons. First, because it was held as
close as possible to the ceiling and did not fit against it, they felt there was potential for fiber escape; and second,
they questioned how effective it would be if one of the workers holding it up got tired and dropped it. (Ex. 143, p. 103).
OSHA agrees; the device may be used therefore only as an alternative control method pursuant to the requirements for
certification in paragraph (g)(6).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
Mini-Enclosures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Mini-enclosures, the other control method allowed for Class I work is supported by a submission by BCTD which described
a portable isolation enclosure developed by J. Streiter of Southern Insulation Inc. (Ex. 119, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5). OSHA notes, however, that mini-enclosures are manufactured by other companies and this rule does not limit use
of the device to any particular manufacturer. In an accompanying trade paper article the portable enclosure is described
as: ``a cubicle with an extendable shroud that fits on top. A HEPA filtration system drew air down from the ceiling.
Inside the enclosure was a suited man; opposite was a trapped door with a bag attached *&blank;*&blank;* the worker
remove[d] the tile, clean[ed] off the grid and deposit[ed] everything in the bag after opening the trap door. Suction
would pull the door shut. Within the enclosure was a shower attachment *&blank;*&blank;*'' The submission also contained
air sampling data obtained during use of this apparatus while removing ceiling tiles from a Virginia building. The
results indicated that fiber levels averaged less than 0.01 f/cc. However, as pointed out by BCTD in its post-hearing
brief there was failure to achieve clearance (0.01 f/cc under AHERA) in this building following use of the device which
``necessitated evacuation of the work areas on several occasions.'' As explained elsewhere in this document, OSHA
is not requiring AHERA clearance levels to be achieved for Class I work. If such requirements must be met, the employer
should employ all applicable controls which in some cases may exceed those in these standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Class II Work
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Class II asbestos work is defined as activities involving the removal of ACM or PACM which is not TSI or surfacing ACM.
According to the definition, this includes, but is not limited to, the removal of asbestos-containing wallboard,
floor tile and sheeting, gaskets, joint compounds, roofing felts, roofing and siding shingles, and construction
mastics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has found that the exposure potential from Class II work is generally lower than for Class I work, when removal
is conducted under substantially similar conditions. Consequently, if the employer shows, that in any particular
job, that well-trained and experienced workers, with an established ``track record'' of keeping exposures low will
perform that removal, the required controls are less stringent than those required for Class I removals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removal of materials which are not TSI or surfacing ACM may be handled by complying with work practice and engineering
control requirements for Class II in paragraph (g)(7), and the generic requirements for all asbestos work in (g)(1)
of the standard. Additionally, methods allowed for Class I removals may be used for Class II work, unless the system
cannot be adapted for Class II work, such as in the case of the water spray process system. Glove bags/boxes can be installed
around some materials covered by the Class II designation, such as gaskets and ceiling tiles. It is OSHA's intent to
allow Class I methods to be used for removing Class II materials when no modification in the apparatus is required,
without special notice to OSHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As Class II work, removal of asbestos-containing material such as floor tiles and roofing will not be subject to quantity
cut-offs for using certain control methods. This is similar to the proposal, which would have allowed these materials
to be removed using mandated work practices, and exempted compliant jobs from negative pressure enclosure requirements.
Under the final standard, other materials classified as ``miscellaneous'' by EPA such as transite panel and valves/gaskets
may be removed without quantity limitation so long as Class II work practices are followed. Additionally, the standard
allows all other materials (except TSI and surfacing ACM) to be removed using the generic work practices in paragraph
(g)(1) which require wet methods, HEPA vacuuming and prompt waste disposal, and pursuant to additional controls
in (g)(2) if the PEL may be exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (g)(7)(i) and (ii) establish ``setting-up'' requirements which apply to all removals of all Class II
materials. These include the requirement that a competent person supervise the work and that where a negative exposure
assessment cannot be produced or changed conditions during the job indicate elevated fiber levels, critical barriers
or other isolation methods must be used or where the ACM is not removed in a substantially intact.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA is also listing specific work practices for some kinds of Class II work which are common, such as removing flooring
material or roofing material, as proposed. The generic list of work practices for all operations under this standard
in paragraph (g)(1), covers most specific practices set out for each kind of removal. However, since both OSHA and
participants believe that stating how each kind of material must be removed in specific terms will enhance compliance,
paragraph (g)(7)(2) restates the relevant generic requirements in terms specific to each activity. For example,
using wet methods for all asbestos work, unless the employer can show wet methods are infeasible, is now required,
in the generic requirements, for all asbestos work [see (g)(1)]. However, wet methods encompass a range of work practices.
For example, when removing material which is bound in a matrix, misting may be appropriate. Removing ACM or PACM which
is not so bound, or where deterioration of the ACM has occurred, would require more aggressive wetting. Thus, in the
paragraph applying to flooring removal, the employer must mist the ``snip point'' used for cutting sheet flooring.
For roofing removal, the blades of all powered tools must be continually misted during use. OSHA believes these more
specific directions will help insure that work is done protectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA proposed to require use of wet methods to remove sheet floor covering. RFCI guidelines state that floor tile is
to be removed by prying up an edge but no mention of the use of water on the floor tile is made. The revised standards require
the use of wet methods wherever feasible including operations involving the removal of all floor covering materials
known or presumed to contain asbestos. P. Quirk, an asbestos consultant, recommended that ``Floor tile and sheet
removal must utilize wet methods for all work'' (Ex. 3&hyph;34). A representative of the Resilient Floor and Decorative
Covering Union expressed a similar view that ``the floor should be kept adequately wet during the entire operation''
(Ex. 7&hyph;37). Based on this support, OSHA has concluded that most flooring removals must be performed using wet
methods when feasible and has included this requirement in the final with one exception. The exception allows floor
tiles to be removed intact using heat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Specific Work Practices for Specific Class II Operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, certain precautions are always required for all work under these construction and shipyard standards
in paragraph (g)(1). These are HEPA equipped vacuums, wet methods, and prompt disposal of waste and debris. Additional
provisions apply to the removal of all Class II material [Paragraph (g)(7)]. These are required critical barriers
in designated indoor activities and dropcloths in all. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also includes more detailed work practices for specific Class II activities, such as the removal of roofing materials
and resilient flooring material. Most of these requirements are more specific applications of general industrial
principles for handling dust-generating materials, asbestos in particular. OSHA and many participants believe
that employers are helped by specific work practice requirements so long as they do not restrict common sense accommodations
to unique workplace conditions. The following discussion show the reasons for and support of OSHA's decisions for
specific work practices for removal or disturbing ACM or PACM.

Flooring Operations

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Flooring operations are separately discussed because of the amount of interest in these activities manifest during
the rulemaking, and the prevalence of asbestos-containing flooring materials in buildings. Because of the prevalence
of asbestos-containing flooring, the frequency which it is maintained and removed, and the possibility of exposure
if improperly done, specific requirements for flooring are needed to reduce significant risk to the extent feasible.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Removal of asbestos containing flooring materials is a Class II asbestos job. As such, it must be performed using the
operation specific controls set out in paragraph (g)(ii)(a), or when called for by an ``exposure assessment using
``alternative'' controls. Additional controls must be used if the employer does not produce a ``negative exposure
assessment'' prior to the beginning of the job, if during the job, there is reasonable belief that a permissible exposure
level will be exceeded, or if methods are used which are expected to result in flooring material breaking or otherwise
removed in a non-intact state. The required controls in large part mirror those of the proposal which were based on
work practice recommended by the Resilient Flooring Covering Institute (RFCI). Additional ``non-aggressive''
practices are allowed, in response to supporting data and to commenters such as Michael Murphy of Monsanto who asked
that OSHA ``*&blank;*&blank;* allow the use of other practices which achieve comparable results'' (Ex. 7&hyph;125).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that these provisions are necessary and appropriate to reduce risk to workers who perform this type
of activity. The relative level of risk of removing asbestos-containing flooring was considered in the rulemaking.
OSHA has not classified asbestos containing flooring as ``high risk.'' The degree of risk from removing these materials
depends on the kind of removal activity performed, and on the condition of the material. Data relating to flooring
removal show overall lower levels than TSI and surfacing ACM (see e.g., Ex. 7&hyph;100; 7&hyph;132). Thus, EPA recently
included resilient floor covering, in its lowest risk category (Category I non-friable ACM). However EPA concluded
that ``if these materials are in poor condition and are friable or they are subjected to sanding, grinding, cutting
or abrading, they are to be treated as friable asbestos materials (55 FR at 48409). The OSHA record supports these findings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Opinions of some asbestos abatement experts familiar with a range of asbestos removal projects agreed with the basis
for EPA's and OSHA's classification scheme. Marshall Marcus stated that flooring removals, when well conducted
are likely to involve lower exposures than removals of other types of interior asbestos containing materials; whereas
Mary Finn emphasized that removing of flooring tile, because it cannot be saturated easily, may, when aggressively
removed, result in significant exposures (see testimony of Marshall Marcus, Tr. 3794 and Mary Finn Tr. 3765). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's approach of requiring those removal methods which are unlikely to elevate exposures was challenged by participants
who contended that methods for removing flooring cannot be determined at the beginning of the project. This might
occur when employees discover during the project that flooring is resistant to removal. This may be difficult to predict
in advance, as pointed out by BCTD (Ex. 143 at 155, citing testimony of asbestos contractor and consultant Marshall
Marcus, Tr. 3794 and others). OSHA acknowledges that such difficulties may occur. However, as pointed out by Mary
Finn, many of the variables contributing to exposures are available for consideration at the inception of the project;
``*&blank;*&blank;* the predictability of how aggressive one must remove floor tile varies from job to job depending
on the age of the particular materials, depending on the wear that it's undergone and depending on the techniques that
the particular contractor and his workers might use'' (Tr. 3744). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, OSHA notes that much of the project data submitted show consistency in practices over the entire project. In
cases where more aggressive methods are resorted to mid-job, OSHA requires a ``mid-course correction:'' a re-evaluation
of the exposure potential by the competent person, and the installation of additional controls if the projection
is that the exposures will exceed the PEL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most ``aggressive'' techniques, such as ``shot-blasting'' may be used only after an evaluation showed that less
aggressive methods are not feasible. Even if the evaluation of the ``aggressive'' method shows exposures will be
below the PEL, the employees must still install critical barriers or otherwise isolate the removal operation [paragraph
(g)(4)(i)(B)(2)], and employees must wear respirators. This is required regardless of when such ``aggressive''
methods were used, at the inception, or mid-way into a removal job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific ``non-aggressive'' control methods are allowed and preferred for removing flooring materials (tile,
sheet, and mastics) which contain asbestos and those materials for which the employer/building owner has not verified
the absence of asbestos. The controls are ``non-aggressive'' work practices, and include the practices which under
OSHA's proposal would have allowed an exemption from the requirement to erect a negative pressure enclosure for flooring
material removal (see 55 FR at 29719). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA did not propose to require employers to assume that vinyl or asphalt tile or resilient flooring was asbestos containing,
although the RFCI recommended that such an assumption be made. OSHA asked for comments on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several industrial hygienists agreed that the recommendation should be followed. For example, David Kirby, industrial
hygienist, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, testified that an ongoing survey of ORNL facilities showed that ``90 percent
of our floor tile either contained asbestos or the mastic material that's used to attach them to the floors contained
asbestos.'' Mr. Kirby recommended that it's ``prudent to *&blank;*&blank;* assume that all floor tile materials
contain asbestos, unless you can prove the contrary *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Tr. 124&hyph;125). According to Mr. Kirby,
negating the presence of asbestos content in flooring material entails a complex and expensive process; ``taking
those materials, having them ashed, using high temperature ashing techniques, and then the residue could be analyzed
by transmission electron microscopy.'' Other evidence in the record indicated the prevalence of asbestos containing
flooring material. An EPA 1988 survey, cited in the HEI report, reported that 42% of public and commercial buildings
within the U.S. contain asbestos containing floor tile (Ex. 1&hyph;344).

A review of the comments and evidence demonstrates that there is a high degree of prevalence of asbestos-containing
flooring and that there are diagnostic difficulties in identifying asbestos fibers in flooring material. Consequently,
OSHA is changing its approach and the final standard provides that the employers shall assume in removing flooring
that it contains asbestos and take the specific precautions unless the employer demonstrates that the flooring materials
are not asbestos-containing. Such a showing must be based on analysis which is likely to reveal the asbestos content
of the flooring material, the backing and the mastic. No one protocol for analysis is specified, but the standard requires
that a certified industrial hygienist (CIH) or project designer certify the analytical results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the final standard's provisions relating to flooring removal are more comprehensive and protective
than the proposal's. There, an exemption for flooring removals from the NPE requirement was conditioned merely on
compliance with certain work practices recommended by the Resilient Floor Covering Institute (RFCI). These practices
included a prohibition of sanding of floor or backing, use of a HEPA vacuum cleaner before and after removal, prohibition
of dry sweeping, application of new material over old tiles without removal if possible, wet removal of residual felt,
and bagging and disposal of waste in 6 mil plastic containers. The new final provisions allow removal to be performed
by these methods, but also allow various heating methods to be used, or any other means of loosening floor tiles, without
breakage. Unlike the proposal, an employer cannot proceed without negative air or critical barriers, merely using
non-aggressive work practices and wet methods, unless his pre-job evaluation shows that similar floor removals
(in the same building or of the same materials and mastics) were successfully completed by work crews with adequate
training and experience in working under these conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA noted in the proposal that data provided by RFCI showed that where jobs followed their recommended practices,
mean exposures to workers were between 0.0045 and 0.03 f/cc for workers performing floor tile removal, removal of
resilient sheet flooring, or removal of cutback adhesive. During the rulemaking, additional data were submitted
showing exposure levels during flooring removals. David Kirby, OSHA witness from Oak Ridge National Laboratory
(ORNL) said that he has used the RFCI work practices successfully, maintaining personal sampling fiber levels at
an average of 0.0075 f/cc (range 0.001 to 0.029) (Tr. 99). When asked what additional precautions were taken at his
facilities during these operations, he replied that ``we do use regulated areas in the sense that we don't allow anyone
in the area as we're doing the work, and we also require workers to wear respiratory protection as they're doing this
activity, but yet we don't feel like there is *&blank;*&blank;* a need for negative pressure enclosures.'' (Tr. 124).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BCTD, in its post-hearing brief argued that the RFCI methods specifically, and ``non-aggressive'' flooring removal
methods generally, do not always result in exposure levels which are acceptable (Ex. 143). It cited various studies
or project results submitted to the record. Some of these results were given in terms of structures per square centimeter,
a convention of TEM. For example, Richard Kelly of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory objected to allowing the
use of RFCI methods to control asbestos exposure during removal of asbestos containing mastic (Ex. 11, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
22). He reported that during removals in which only the mastic contained asbestos, he had measured (by TEM) fiber levels
of 33 s/cc during dry power chipping of VAT and 0.9 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s/cc during wet hand removal in what he called a ``real-world application of the RFCI procedures.'' He noted that the
floor was not pre-vacuumed nor was a heat gun used as described in the recommended practices. Under its AHERA rule,
EPA defines ``structure'' as a microscopic bundle, cluster, fiber or matrix which may contain asbestos. OSHA notes
that such structures may be smaller and/or thinner than the asbestos fibers required to be counted under the OSHA reference
method. A general summary of the results of these studies shows that most of the exposure levels were below the proposed
PELs when measured using the OSHA reference method (e. g., Gobbell, 1991, exposure range, 0.01 to 0.035: AT &amp;T,
1990, non-detected to 0.019).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some other studies of floor removals entered into the record showed higher exposure levels of ``structures'' as detected
by TEM, and defined by EPA. As noted above, counts of structures are not comparable to fiber counts, and OSHA believes
that most ``structure'' counts result in significantly higher fiber counts than would be counted by PCM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A related issue is whether flooring material should be analyzed by TEM, rather than by PCM. As pointed out by BCTD and
other participants, floor tile tends to generate smaller fibers which often cannot be detected under PCM; and TEM
detects these shorter asbestos fibers (and the thinner asbestos fibers, which PCM cannot distinguish [Ex. 143, p.
147 citing Tr. 3468; Tr 3751, Tr. 3279, Tr. 473&hyph;474]. In the 1986 rulemaking OSHA considered the issue of the relative
toxicity of short asbestos fibers, which were not required to be counted under the OSHA definition of ``fiber.'' Then,
the Agency stated that ``*&blank;*&blank;* animal studies *&blank;*&blank;* in particular the recent work by Dr.
Davis, point to a clear relationship between fiber dimension and disease potential. The finding in these studies
that thin fibers, (having an aspect ratio of at least 3:1) greater than 5 &mu;m in length are associated with elevated
incidence of cancer and lung fibrosis is also consistent with current knowledge regarding lung clearance mechanisms,
i.e., that shorter fibers are easily phagocytized and removed from lung tissue'' (51 FR at 22613). Dosages used in
OSHA's risk assessment extrapolated from studies of human exposure, attempted to transform or reconstruct fiber
counts to correlate with fiber counts using current conventions of counting fibers only longer than 5 &mu;m, using
PCM. Similar to the conclusions reached by OSHA in the preamble to its 1986 asbestos rule, the HEI report of 1991 found
that ``experimental results described in this review indicate that short fiber preparations have a lower toxicity
than long fiber preparations, but do not exclude their contribution to the lesions caused by the smaller number of
long fibers in the tail of the fiber length distribution *&blank;*&blank;* individual fibers shorter than approximately
5 &mu;m appear to possess much less toxicity than those longer than 5 &mu;m'' (Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 6&hyph;76). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HEI Report also noted that the exposure-response relationship reported in the literature which served as the
basis for estimation of risk had exposure expressed in terms of fibers greater than 5 &mu;m in length ( Ex. 1&hyph;344).
These aspects of OSHA's risk assessment, and counting protocols were not challenged in the litigation following
the 1986 rules, therefore were not remanded to OSHA for reconsideration in the Court of Appeal's 1988 decision. The
only study submitted in its entirety, (see Freed et al, Ex. 143 at Att. B), is of limited relevance; it is a case study,
which was undertaken to show that asbestos fiber may produce DIP (desquamative interstitial pneumonia) as well as
asbestosis. The authors note that ``although over 90% of the 820 million fibers of wet lung tissue were 3 &mu;m or less
in length, sufficient numbers of fibers greater than 5 &mu;m in length were present, which could also account for the
tissue response'' (Ex. 143, Att B at 332). Resolution of whether short or long fibers are counted is not necessary for
the purposes of this revised standard, because OSHA finds that work practices and controls are needed when working
on floors regardless of the measurement method used. OSHA does not change its conclusion and retains the provisions
that airborne asbestos measurements taken during flooring operations shall use the same methodology as in the 1986
standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency's analysis of data submitted showing exposure levels during flooring removal, shows a general correlation
between lower levels and ``non-aggressive'' methods, and higher levels and ``aggressive methods.'' For example,
Mary Finn of Chart Services, an asbestos consulting company, testified that ``if breakage is minimized, obviously
exposures are going to go down'' (Tr. 3765). Ms. Finn submitted area sampling data from flooring removal operations
which had a mean of 0.056 f/cc as an 8-hour time-weighted average (Ex. 9&hyph;18). She also presented data on area TEM
counts taken during four operations involving drilling through VAT_the mean for the four samples was 0.3 structures/cc
(2 samples were below the limit of detection and one value was 1.01 f/cc), while all four samples were below the limit
of detection when measured by PCM. BCTD cited various studies showing high fiber levels during flooring removal (Ex.
143 at 151&hyph;153). One, the Cook data, showed some high short term levels on one job, it was unclear what work practices
were used, other jobs done by the same firm showed exposure values less than the PELs (see Ex. 35 and 119S). The Rosby
data showed short term data which were well within the PEL excursion limit (Ex. 119 U). Other data pointed to by BCTD
as indicating the unreliability of exposure reductions using non-aggressive methods, merely shows that EPA clearance
levels were not achieved (Ex. 7&hyph;132), that exceedances were possible (Ex. 7&hyph;137 [it is noted that an exposure
of .11 f/cc is considered in compliance with OSHA's PEL, and that TEM fiber counts were elevated (Ex. 119T)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the Environ data contracted for and submitted by RFCI and Armstrong, which was interpreted differently
by the submitter and by BCTD, these and other interested parties submitted additional data showing exposure levels
during various kinds of asbestos-containing flooring removal. Low exposure levels were obtained in a New York State
Department of Health Study, for floor tile removal using automated infrared heating, (followed by hand scraping)(see
Ex. 7&hyph;100). As noted above, OSHA is allowing removal to be performed using heat, so long as tiles are not broken
during the removal process. Under contract with EPA, PEI Associates performed a study which was described in a report
entitled ``Evaluation of Tile and Mastic Removal at Fort Sill'' (Ex. 1&hyph;330). TEM was used to measure fiber levels
resulting from use of several different methods to remove tile and/or mastic. They found that ``airborne asbestos
levels averaged 0.135 structures per cubic centimeter (s/cc) during dry tile removal, 0.066 s/cc during wet tile
removal, 0.247 s/cc during removal of mastic using citric acid and towels and 0.326 s/cc during sand machine mastic
removals. No PCM measurements were presented, and the proportion of the TEM-measured fibers exceeding 5

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The question of whether a negative pressure enclosure should be required for floor tile removal, was considered during
the rulemaking. Some participants, including asbestos abatement consultant, Marshall Marcus recommended negative
pressure enclosures as a matter of course for asbestos containing flooring removal (See e.g., Tr. 3796 and Ex. 7&hyph;37,
7&hyph;92). OSHA notes that its final rule now requires bystander protection, when excessive exposure levels are
measured or expected. The questionable benefits to flooring removal employees of working within a enclosure are
discussed in the general discussion on NPEs in this preamble. OSHA also notes that some exposure data submitted concerning
flooring removal exposure levels, contained relatively high exposures for work within enclosures (see e.g., Ex.
7&hyph;134A) and that removing flooring using dry ice in a negative pressure enclosure can result in toxic buildups
within the enclosure (see Tr. 202). Therefore OSHA is not generally requiring flooring removal to be done within NPEs.
However, where flooring material is removed using ``aggressive methods,'' higher fiber levels have been reported,
at least as measured by TEM (see Ex 11, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
22 and 9&hyph;18). The Agency concludes that the use of aggressive floor removal techniques in which the material
is not removed intact, such as mechanical chipping of floor tile and shot-blast removal of mastic, are likely to result
in the release of larger amounts of fibers and must be performed within negative-pressure enclosures or the equivalent.
EPA has concluded similarly: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Removal of VAT (or other known or assumed ACM flooring or its adhesive) which involves sanding, grinding, mechanical
chipping, drilling, cutting or abrading the material has a high probability of rendering the material friable and
capable of releasing asbestos fibers. Therefore, removal projects which employ any of these techniques (other than
small-scale-short-duration) must be conducted as response actions, including use of a project designer, accredited
persons, and air clearance (55 FR 48409). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to concerns that the RFCI work practices will not be followed, it should be pointed out that the alternate
to their use is full enclosure of the operation which is likely to be considered more burdensome than the work practices.

Transite Removal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Removal of transite panels is considered a Class II activity in this revised standard. As such, they are required to
be removed using certain practices and controls. These are: the intact removal of transite panels; the use of wet methods
followed by wrapping of the panels in plastic; and the lowering of panels to the ground without breakage. These provisions
are in essence the same one proposed by OSHA in 1990 when allowing an exemption from the NPE requirements. The 1990 proposal
presented the comments of OSHA field personnel which suggested that removal of transite panels, without regard to
quantity, should be exempt from the negative-pressure enclosure requirement as long as the transite is removed without
cutting or otherwise abrading the material (Ex. 1&hyph;59). This suggestion was supported by numerous participants
(Ex. 7&hyph;6, 7&hyph;9, 7&hyph;23, 7&hyph;42, 7&hyph;43, 7&hyph;47, 7&hyph;52, 7&hyph;62, 7&hyph;63, 7&hyph;74,
7&hyph;79, 7&hyph;86, 7&hyph;95, 7&hyph;99, 7&hyph;103, 7&hyph;106, 7&hyph;108, 7&hyph;111, 7&hyph;112, 7&hyph;125,
7&hyph;128, 7&hyph;134, 7&hyph;144, 7&hyph;146, 7&hyph;140). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional work practices such as wrapping panels and lowering them intact, were suggested in this proceeding and
are incorporated in the revised standards [see comments of Robert Welch of Columbia Gas System who recommended wrapping
intact transite panels in sheeting and lowering them intact to the ground avoiding breakage (Ex. 7&hyph;23); and,
comments of Edward Karpetian of the Los Angeles Department of Power and Water, who recommended that in addition, the
material be HEPA vacuumed and wrapped (Ex. 7&hyph;42)]. As noted in prior discussion of the general provisions covering
construction activities, negative pressure enclosures are not required for Class II activities, unless they are
performed along with a Class I activity for which an NPE is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rulemaking record contains strong evidence showing low exposures resulting from transite panel removal when
appropriate work practices are followed. The submission of the American Paper Institute and the National Forest
Products Association contained sampling data taken during the removal of transite panels from paper machine hoods
(Ex. 7&hyph;74). Wet methods were used and the area was regulated. Personal and area samples were well below 0.1 f/cc,
with the 23 personal samples having an average of 0.012 f/cc (not time-weighted). Rose Simpson of Lubrizol stated
that ``area monitoring samples taken during transite removal operations at our facilities indicate exposure levels
well below the current 0.2 f/cc and the proposed 0.1 f/cc limits'' (Ex. 7&hyph;86). OSHA witness David Kirby of Oak
Ridge National Laboratory stated in his comments that personal air monitoring during transite panel removal resulted
in average fiber level of 0.008 f/cc (8 hr. TWA) (Ex. 7&hyph;111). And in a post-hearing submission (Ex. 105), he presented
the fiber levels (measured by PCM) generated during non-enclosed transite removal performed wet at ORNL, which ranged
from &lt;0.031 to &lt;0.082 f/cc (mean=0.058 f/cc) (see also Ex. 140, where the Dow Chemical Company claimed transite
removal real time levels did not exceed 0.07 f/c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, most data show that if performed intact, transite removal will result in exposures well below
the PELs. Some evidence, however, was presented showing exceedances. Paul Heffernan of Kaselaan &amp; D'Angelo
Associates, Inc. stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;removal of transite panels which are not cut or broken should not be generically allowed.
Many transite panels used in interior wall construction consist of very rough inner surfaces from which asbestos
fiber is readily released into the air. Kaselaan &amp; D'Angelo Associates has monitored the removal of 18

&rsquo; by 36
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; transite panels which were held in place with screws. The transite panels were removed intact by removing
the screws and lifting the relatively small panels to the floor where they were placed in boxes. The exposed surface
of each panel was first wet with amended water before removing the screws. The job was performed within negative pressure
containment. Airborne fiber levels exceeding 1.0 f/cc were measured. Transite panel removal has potential for fiber
release even when the panels are not broken (Ex. 7&hyph;36).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above in the flooring material discussion, OSHA is requiring job by job evaluation of each Class II job, including
transite panel removal projects, by a competent person, as part of the requirements to perform an initial exposure
assessment. As detailed above, the data submitted to the record show that transite panel removal without cutting
usually results in very low exposure levels. Building and facility records of past removals of similar material will
alert on-site competent persons to the exposure potential of the panels in their facilities. For rare cases, when
the evaluation of material, condition, crew and past exposure data do not support a ``negative exposure assessment,''
(i.e., that excessive exposures may be expected), additional precautions are required by the standard, including
critical barriers, and respirator use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that these provisions will protect employees against significant exposures, are feasible, and are
supported by the record. In particular OSHA finds that quantity limitations on transite panel removal would not tend
to reduce risk, and in some cases may increase fiber levels. For example, Richard Olson of Dow Co. pointed out that if
transite panel removal were to be exempted from the negative pressure enclosure requirement and the cutoff remained
at 9 square feet as proposed, it would be necessary to cut nearly every piece of material removed or always use a negative-pressure
enclosure (Ex. 7&hyph;103).

Cementitious Asbestos-Containing Siding (CACS)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The removal of cementitious asbestos-containing siding is a Class II activity. OSHA is requiring the same work practices
for shingle removal as for transite panel removal. OSHA did not propose specific work practices for removal of CACS,
either to exempt this activity from the negative pressure enclosure requirement or to qualify as a SSSD activity.
However, many participants representing a wide spectrum of interests, including states, federal agencies, and
asbestos industry organizations, recommended that OSHA exempt CACS removal from the requirement to establish negative-pressure
enclosures; (See e.g. asbestos coordinator for Florida (Ex. 7&hyph;6); Navy Office of Chief of Operations (Ex. 7&hyph;52);
Asbestos Information Association/North America (Ex. 7&hyph;120); New York City Department of Environmental Protection
(Ex. 126); and, The Army Corps of Engineers who also submitted the data from a study of fiber levels generated during
CACS removals Ex. 1&hyph;307). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Army Corps of Engineers' study cited above, three mechanical CACS asbestos removal methods and the manual method
were evaluated by monitoring during removal of the siding. The three methods were: 1) super wet: the siding was thoroughly
wetted with water on the outfacing and back side; 2) mist: a measured amount of water was applied to the outfacing side
of the siding only; and, 3) encapsulation: an EPA-approved commercially available encapsulant was applied at or
above the recommended application rate. These removals took place inside enclosures and the hand method was also
evaluated. Samples were measured using TEM and results of area samples indicated all were less than 0.005 or below
the limit of detection. Two personal samples taken ``while removing cement-asbestos siding shingles from Building
523'' yielded 8 hour time-weighted averages of 0.008 and 0.012 f/cc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other data show low exposures during CACS removal. One where approximately 110,000 square feet, in total of CACS were
moved from 43 college campus dormitory buildings prior to demolition. The average bulk analysis of the CACS was 17%.
No outdoor area samples were higher than 0.01 f/cc by PCM for the duration of the project. The 80 personal samples collected
during the project had an arithmetic average of 0.049 f/cc with a standard deviation of 0.041. The geometric mean was
0.04 f/cc with not TEM data available (Ex. 7&hyph;132A). The study authors concluded that ``CACS removal, even though
outside where dilution is assumed significant, should be done carefully, using as a minimum the abatement techniques
described in this paper.'' These included wetting, dropcloths, and a 20-foot wide regulated area. OSHA agrees and
believes that the methods required by the standard will reduce risk significantly for exposed workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Results of this study and others show that CACS removal can be performed using work practices which minimize exposure
to workers and that containment in NPEs is neither necessary or appropriate in most cases to protect the workers performing
the removals or working nearby. However, it is clear that Class II work practices are necessary to keep exposures low.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has coupled CACS removal with transite panel removal in the regulatory provisions establishing mandatory work
practices for the removal of these materials.

Roofing Operations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final construction standard classifies removal of roofing material which contains asbestos as a Class II operation.
As such, specific exposure assessment and work practices must be performed. The record shows that these work practices
can be feasibly implemented and are necessary to effectively reduce airborne asbestos levels from roofing removal
projects. They consist of continual misting of cutting machines during use, keeping roofing materials intact during
removal, using wet methods, immediately lowering unwrapped or unbagged roofing material to a covered receptacle
using a dust-tight chute, or immediately wrapping roofing material in plastic sheeting, and lowering it to ground
by the end of the work shift.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, unless the employer can demonstrate that it is not feasible, the roof level heating and ventilation air
intake and discharge sources must be isolated, HEPA filtered, or extended beyond the regulated area, or mechanical
systems must be shut down and vents sealed with 6 mil plastic. OSHA has taken into account concerns that isolating air
intakes may cause heat build-up in the building (Ex. 7&hyph;7). As for all Class II work, respirators must be worn if
material cannot be removed in an intact state, or if wet methods are not used. In addition, regulated areas must be established
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions are similar to the conditions proposed by OSHA which would have allowed an exemption from the proposed
negative pressure enclosure requirement providing implementation of specific control methods which would have
applied to all non-exempt removal jobs. In the proposal, the Agency stated that it did not believe that requiring use
of negative pressure enclosures on roofs would result in more than a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 benefit to workers removing roofing or to other employees in their vicinity. That the safety hazards which might be
imposed by their use on roofs would outweigh the benefits (55 FR at 29719). The Agency proposed that employers engaged
in roofing operations take additional steps to reduce employee exposure to asbestos. These steps included use of
dust-tight chutes to lower debris from the roof to the ground, or immediate bagging and lowering of debris rather than
dumping it from a height. Wetting would also be required where feasible to reduce contamination. The Agency felt that
these measures had been shown to be effective in reducing employee and bystander exposures during roofing operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was general support for the exemption of roofing operations from the NPE requirement (Ex. 7&hyph;1, 7&hyph;12,
7927, 7&hyph;36, 7&hyph;39, 7&hyph;43, 7&hyph;52, 7&hyph;95). BCTD acknowledged that negative-pressure enclosures
are infeasible for most roofing operations. OSHA also believes that categorizing roofing removals as Class II work
is well supported by the record. Some data show exceedances of the new PEL in roofing operations (see Ex. 9&hyph;34
QQ, cited by BCTD, Ex. 143 at 135). Other data show roofing removals, where proper work practices are followed, generate
low exposure levels, e.g., data submitted by NCRA, collected by SRI shows many exposures were below the revised PEL,
most jobs used wet methods (Ex. 9&hyph;31A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A health survey submitted by the BCTD showed asbestos related diseases and deaths among roofers in the period from
1976&hyph;1989 (Ex. 119 QQ). That study is evidence that proper protective practices are necessary to protect workers.
However, diseases resulted from past exposures both removing and installing asbestos-containing roofing without
protective requirements and do not necessarily predict worker health from lower exposures resulting primarily
from removal work performed more protectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition participants supported required work practices (see Ex. 7&hyph;120, 7&hyph;132, 7&hyph;36). BCTD
preferred adoption by OSHA of the recommendations made by the labor representatives of ACCSH which are more rigorous
than the work practices proposed by OSHA. The additional practices would include: establishing the entire roof as
a regulated area; cutting or removing ACM using hand methods whenever possible; equipping all powered tools with
a HEPA vacuum system or a misting device; HEPA vacuuming all loose dust left by the sawing operation; and, isolating
all roof-level air intake and discharge sources, or shutting down all mechanical systems and sealing off all outside
vents using two layers of 6 mil polyethylene (Ex. 34). As noted above, OSHA has adopted most of these additional work
practices in the final regulations. OSHA is not requiring the entire roof to be designated as a regulated area: the
portion to be removed may be a small part of the entire roof. The regulated area should encompass that portion of the
roof where dust and debris from the removal is likely to accumulate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One issue concerning required controls is whether OSHA should prohibit power cutting on roofing materials containing
asbestos. Information in the record is inconclusive on whether power cutting usually results in higher exposure
levels than hand cutting. A representative of the National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA) testified that
``we're finding extremely low readings (on the power cutter); *&blank;*&blank;* it appears to us that the cutting
of the material seals the edges because of the heat of the blade of the cutter, mixing with the asphalt'' (Tr. 2427).
Other data were submitted to show that power cutting elevates asbestos fiber levels compared to hand cutting; however
OSHA believes that some of these conclusions may overstate the results of limited experimentation. For example,
one study was presented as suggesting that power cutting elevated fiber levels over hand cutting (Ex 1&hyph;357).
OSHA regards this study as not definitive. The differences in fiber levels in the breathing zones of workers were only
marginally statistically significant, and there was another variable in the study's protocol which may have effected
the outcome. OSHA recognizes the bound nature of the asbestos in most roofing materials, however, it also understands
the physical principles involved in cutting of these materials and that such actions release fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of this mixed record, OSHA concludes that no prohibition of power cutting is called for as long as the other
specified precautions including misting are carefully followed. The standard allows power cutting, but also requires
that sections of roofing material shall be cut into the largest pieces which can be feasibly handled for disposal pursuant
to the standard. Requiring misting of power tools in all situations except where a competent person determines that
misting may decrease safety is expected to help reduce exposure levels from power cutting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The general requirement that all asbestos work be performed wet, unless the employer can demonstrate lack of feasibility
applies to roofing operations. A discussion of this provision is found above in the discussion on paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B).
As noted there, ``flooding'' is not required; ``misting'' of cut areas is sufficient to control dust.

OSHA believes that these precautions are necessary to protect employees who remove roofing materials against elevated
exposures in normal circumstances. The record shows, however, that elevated exposures may occur where damaged or
friable roofing material is removed. [See SRI report, recommending the use of respirators where roofing material
is ``uncharacterized and aged'' (Ex. 9&hyph;31A at 20)]. Under such circumstances, the competent person's determination
must be that the normal precautions are not sufficient. Steven Phillips, counsel to the NCRA agreed: ``(w)hen you're
working with uncharacterized and aged roofing materials, that is *&blank;*&blank;* where you have no idea what the
exposures may be because you have no historical data; you haven't worked with that particular material; *&blank;*&blank;*
(there are) the normal OSHA requirements of doing initial job site monitoring and having respirators until you have
good, reliable, job site monitoring'' (Tr. 2463). In such atypical circumstances, additional precautions, including
respirator use and more extensive wetting, will be necessary. NRCA's objection to the routine use of respirators
on roofing jobs, as recommended by BCTD, was based on its view that respirator use on roofs often compromises worker
safety, because respirators reduce ``downward visibility'' of the wearer (Tr. 2463). OSHA agrees that in some roofing
conditions, limitations from wearing respirators might occur. When respirator use is necessary because of the condition
of the roofing material, but respirators cannot be safely worn because of great heat, cold, or high winds, etc., such
roofing jobs shall not be performed until they can be done safely. The Agency has concluded that ``routine'' respirator
use is not required, because as discussed above the required work practices will keep exposures low in normal circumstances;
but where historic data, experience of the crew, or the condition of the roof indicate the possibility of higher exposures,
then respirator use is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various studies which were submitted support OSHA's classification of roofing removal as a Class II activity. They
show that most measured exposures are lower than many studies showing removal of Class I materials; but still may be
significant. In most cases levels below the new PELs can be routinely expected with minimum controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SRI evaluated air monitoring reports from 79 roofing removal operations, 560 personal and 353 area samples (Ex. 9&hyph;31).
All samples, except 24 were well below the new PEL of 0.1 f/cc. Fourteen samples were collected for 30 minutes or less
(and were below the excursion limit). When the remaining sample measurements were calculated as 8 hour time-weighted
averages, they also did not exceed the PEL. The remaining samples did not exceed 0.1 f/cc. The contractors concluded,
``there appears to be no pressing need for air monitoring at the start of each job, negative pressure enclosures, or
wetting. However the use of half-mask respirators is recommended until the source of the fibers in the few samples
where concentrations were above 0.1 f/cc can be defined.'' They added that ``exposure to asbestos should be minimized
until more (or better) information is available; the use of respirators seems a prudent compromise when working with
uncharacterized and aged roofing materials.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submission of Preston Quirk of Gobbell Hays Partners, Inc. included a study entitled ``Airborne Levels During
Non-Friable Asbestos-Containing Material (ACM) Removal'' which was presented at the 1990 meeting of the National
Asbestos Council (Ex. 7&hyph;133a). One section of this study presented the sampling measurements taken during
removal of asbestos-containing roofing felt and flashing using a wet prying and peeling technique with no enclosure.
Five area samples averaged 0.007 f/cc by PCM and 0.008 s/cm3 by TEM. Five personal samples averaged 0.024 f/cc by PCM
and 0.304 f/cc by TEM. It was reported that the personal TEM samples had 0.124 s/cm3 of structure greater than or equal
to 5 &mu;m. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BCTD submitted a study by D. Hogue and K. Rhodes entitled ``Evaluation of Asbestos Fiber Release from Built-up Roof
Removal Projects'' (Ex. 34, VV) in which roofing operations were monitored using both PCM and TEM methods of measurement.
The authors stressed the ``non-scientific'' nature of the study and noted that they had measured only a limited number
of samples. They described a project involving removal of a 15% asbestos roof from a hospital in which a several control
methods were used. Area samples were taken at ``high,'' ``medium,'' and ``low'' locations and most were measured
using the PCM method. During mechanical removal, the arithmetic mean concentration was 0.16 f/cc (not time-weighted);
and during manual removal the average was 0.1 f/cc (non-weighted). Personal samples were measured only by TEM and
the 3 taken during manual removal averaged 0.11 f/cc (also not weighted). In another section of this report the authors
describe a ``Controlled removal of asbestos containing built-up roofing materials without containment with engineering
and work practice controls and extensive sampling and analysis by transmission electron microscopy,'' however,
the specific engineering and work practice controls employed are not described. Nonetheless, the resulting measurements,
both PCM and TEM, are well below the PEL except one sample in which the TEM concentration was 0.1 s/cc.

NIOSH described an evaluation of airborne asbestos fibers during the tear-off of an old asbestos shingle roof from
a residential building (HETA 84&hyph;321&hyph;1590, Ex. 44). Seventeen personal breathing-zone samples were
collected for approximately two hours. For 5 tear-off workers the fiber concentrations ranged from 0.04 to 0.16 f/cc,
arithmetic mean 0.09 f/cc; for two clean-up workers the fiber concentrations ranged from 0.13 to 0.16 f/cc, arithmetic
mean 0.14 f/cc; and, for the 5 workers applying new shingles the concentration ranged from 0.03 to 0.08 f/cc with a mean
of 0.05 f/cc. In this evaluation, NIOSH concluded that there was a hazard from exposure to airborne asbestos fibers
during the tear-off of an asbestos shingle roof and recommended several practices to reduce worker exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that in some cases, the author of the above studies recommend more rigorous controls than the final standards
require. Largely, this was based on evaluations of roofing removal exposure potential based on small numbers of TEM
measurements. As stated elsewhere in this document, OSHA has based its risk assessment, and relative exposure profiles
on the results of many studies which relied on PCM values. OSHA considered TEM in the 1986 standard and concluded that
it was quite expensive and not fully validated. More importantly, OSHA believes that the roofing studies submitted
show the relatively low levels of asbestos fibers emitted during removal work when proper controls are used. The small
number of exceedances which occurred reflect poor work practices and ``uncharacterized and aged material.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the regulated area in the asbestos standards is to prevent asbestos contamination of other parts of
the workplace and to limit exposure to only those specially trained employees who need to work in the area. While OSHA
does not want to shut down the entire building when asbestos work is done on the roof, asbestos entering the ventilation
system during roofing work is clearly unacceptable. OSHA expects good judgment to be used by the competent person
in striving to achieve the intent of the standard. OSHA requires that roof level heating and ventilation air intake
sources must be isolated. The employer would also have the option to shut down the ventilation system and seal it with
plastic. Only necessary work should be done on the roof while asbestos materials are being removed, and the locations
of the work should be selected to minimize exposures, such as upwind of the asbestos work. OSHA agrees that the 20 foot
barrier approach recommended by Mr. Collins (Ex. 7&hyph;52) has merit, but believes the exact determination should
be made on site, and could vary depending upon working conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA concludes that removal of roofing material containing asbestos requires the use of controls to reduce significant
risk. Simple procedures will reduce exposure levels substantially and, for the most part, will reduce levels below
the PELs. OSHA believes that it is appropriate to require specification work practices for removal of asbestos-containing
roofing material, regardless of measure exposure levels. As discussed above, these controls were recommended by
rulemaking participants, although there was some disagreement regarding the need for some of the controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final standard requires the use of wet methods and continuously misting cutting machines during use and loose
dust left by the sawing operation is to be HEPA vacuumed immediately. Some commenters were concerned that water could
create safety hazards, so the standard reflects that the competent person could determine that misting the cutting
machine, or other wet methods, should not be used. If wet methods are not used the respiratory protection provision
of this standard, paragraph (h) requires that respirators be used regardless of exposure level. This provision is
based upon OSHA's finding that dry disturbance or removal of asbestos containing material has large potential to
expose workers and is in accordance with that of EPA NESHAP. Other controls include removing the roofing material
in an intact state to the extent feasible, immediately lower unbagged or unwrapped roofing material to the ground
via dust-tight chute, crane or hoist, or wrapping the roofing material in plastic sheeting and lowering it to the ground,
transferring materials immediately to a closed receptacle in a manner so as to preclude the dispersion of dust, and
sealing off air intakes to the building prior to doing any roofing removal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA concludes from the studies that exposures can go over the PEL and create significant risk in circumstances when
appropriate precautions are not take. Consequently, they support OSHA requirement for some specific work practices
in all circumstances.

Methods of Compliance for Class III Asbestos Work
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The newly revised construction and shipyard employment standards continue to regulate exposure to employees engaged
in repairing and maintaining building components which contain previously installed asbestos containing material.
In the 1986 construction standard, most of these jobs were called ``small-scale, short-duration operations,''
but, as discussed above, OSHA was instructed by the Court of Appeals to clarify the cut-offs for that designation.
Now, OSHA has determined that separate regulatory treatment of repair and maintenance operations will not be limited
by arbitrary duration and amount-of-material-disturbed criteria. Instead, they are called ``Class III operations,''
and are defined as ``repair and maintenance operations which may involve intentional disturbance of ACM, including
PACM'' (see Green Book, Ex. 1&hyph;183). The major difference between the newly revised repair and maintenance definitions,
is that the amount of material and/or the time the operation takes are no longer the criteria for inclusion in the class.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised and expanded definitions of the various terms in the Category III definition enhance its clarity. Since
Category III includes maintenance, repair, some renovation and other operations which disturb ACM, and PACM, a definition
of ``disturb'' is provided. Although ``removal'' activities are designated Category I or II, the incidental cutting
away of small amounts of ACM or PACM to access mechanical or structural components for repair or maintenance, is considered
Category III. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of work which are considered Category III are contained in various studies submitted by participants to
prove or disprove how risky asbestos disturbing repair and maintenance work is. OSHA has evaluated the data from a
number of sources to estimate the degree of exposure of workers to previously installed asbestos building material
during various types of activities. Most studies showed lower levels of exposure than Category I and II work. For example,
the Safe Building Alliance submitted a study by its consultant Price (Ex. 151). He compiled sampling data from numerous
sources including OSHA compliance data, and obtained questionnaire information from building owners. The questionnaires
solicited information on the frequency and duration of specific activities. These activities included, maintenance/repair
of boilers, air handling units, heat exchangers, tanks; repair/replacement of pipe insulation including removal
of small amounts of ACM; and, valve or gasket replacement, of activities above suspended ceilings such as connections
and/or extensions for telecommunication/computer networks; adjustment/repair of HVAC systems; and, testing/cleaning/replacing
smoker or heat detectors. The final activities which may result in ACM contact such as repairing/replacing lighting
fixtures and replacing ceiling tiles. The data were used to calculate potential exposure hours (PEH) which is the
product of the annual frequency of an activity and the duration of that activity in hours. For all activities in all
buildings in the data set, Price calculated a PEH of 91 hours per year and a PEH per worker of 19 hours per year per worker.
Eight-hour time weighted averages were also reported as presented in Table III.

Price concluded that small-scale, short duration activities take up a relatively small proportion of a typical worker's
time in that in 80% of the buildings he studied, less than 22% of total time is spent on these activities in a year, and
that ``on a per worker basis, in 80 percent of the buildings the number of potential exposure hours total slightly less
than 4 percent of a work year'' (Ex. 151, Appendix A, p. 12).

that the study ``demonstrated that in some buildings exposure hours can be very high *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Ex. 143,
p. 112). However, OSHA views the study as supporting its view that when properly controlled, most kinds of routine

A recent study by Kaselaan and d'Angelo Associates for Real Estate's Environmental Action League in 1991 was reviewed
(Ex. 123). The contractors looked at historical data from 5 commercial buildings in which the activities sampled
were reported as ``small-scale, short duration.'' The operations were performed ``almost exclusively'' within
mini-enclosures and most were performed by ``trained and experienced asbestos abatement workers, who are more used
to the larger full-scale asbestos abatement procedures'' and not by building maintenance workers. The data are summarized

probably represented situations in which proper precautions were taken. They concluded that ``the data presented

During these activities, workers were required to wear personal protective equipment. In his discussion of the study
results, Mr. Saul explained that the four values in excess of 0.2 f/cc resulted from: a removal in which wet methods
could not be employed, wetting painted surfaces, removing and wetting metal enclosed pipe lagging, and improperly
sealing of a mini-enclosure. He further concluded that these data indicate that the work practices used by these workers
are generally effective during these maintenance-type asbestos activities.

In addition to the above studies showing relatively low exposures, almost all below the revised PELs, other submissions
showed the potential for Class III work to exceed the PEL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BCTD submitted studies including those by Keyes and Chesson which reported results of a series of experiments designed
to determine fiber levels in asbestos-containing buildings during simulated activities (Ex.9&hyph;34 OO, PP and
7&hyph;53). They demonstrated (using transmission electron microscopic measurements) that use of dry methods
in a room containing damaged ACM and visible dust and debris elevated the fiber level in air significantly, that physical
activity (playing ball) within such an area increased fiber levels and that cable pulling activities also raised
fiber counts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEI submitted an analysis of a data set provided to them by Hygienetics, Inc. which contained data on airborne asbestos
fiber concentrations during various maintenance activities performed under an operations and maintenance (O&amp;M)
program in a large U.S. hospital (Ex. 162&hyph;6). During the period of study, all maintenance work in areas with ACM
in the hospital required a permit issued by the Hygienetics project manager on site. The authors concluded ``*&blank;*&blank;*
spatial and temporal proximity to maintenance work was an important determinate of PCM fiber levels'' (Ex. 1&hyph;344,
p. 1.8). Jobs involving removal of ACM resulted in higher fiber levels than non-removal jobs [personal samples: mean,
removal jobs=0.166 f/cc, non-removal=0.0897 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
f/cc (Ex. 1&hyph;344 p. 1.6)]. HEI concluded that these activities resulted in increased fiber levels (Ex. 1&hyph;344,
p. 1.8). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has reviewed and evaluated all available information pertaining to maintenance, repair, and other asbestos-disturbing
activities within buildings classified as ``Class III'' and has concluded that some of these activities can result
in significant risk from exposure of workers. The range of activities and exposure potential encompassed by a Class
III designation is wide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The studies generally show that when protective work practices are used by trained workers, exposures are greatly
reduced. Thus, OSHA is requiring various work practices and protective measures to reduce exposure to asbestos containing
material (or material which is presumed to contain asbestos) and that workers must receive training in courses which
include the appropriate techniques to use in handling and/or avoiding such disturbances. OSHA concludes that these
are effective, feasible controls needed to reduce significant risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(8) sets out these requirements. Again, wet methods are required; local exhaust ventilation is required,
if feasible; Where the material OSHA has found to be of high-risk, TSI and surfacing material, is drilled, cut, abraded,
sanded, chipped, broken or sawed, dropcloths and isolation methods such as mini-enclosures or glove bags must be
used; and respirators must be worn; and where a negative exposure assessment has not been produced, dropcloths and
plastic barriers (tenting or equivalent) must be used. OSHA believes these mandatory practices will protect employees
who perform Class III work from significant risk of asbestos-related effects.

Class IV Work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As defined in paragraph (b), Class IV work consists of ``maintenance and custodial work'' where employees contact
ACM and PACM, including activities to clean up waste and debris containing ACM and PACM. Examples of such work are sweeping,
mopping, dusting, cleaning, and vacuuming of asbestos containing materials such as resilient flooring, or any surface
where asbestos-containing dust has accumulated; stripping and buffing of asbestos containing resilient flooring,
and clean-up after Class I, II, and III work, or other asbestos construction work such as the installation of new asbestos-containing
materials. Clean-up of waste and debris during a removal job, or other Class job, is Class IV work. Because in these
cases the employee doing the clean-up is within the regulated area and subject to the same exposure conditions as the
employees actually doing the removal, paragraph (9)(1) requires the custodial employee to be provided with the same
respiratory protection as the employees performing the removal or other asbestos work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, exposures for Class IV work are lower than for other classes. Data in the record show this general exposure
profile (see for example, Kominsky study, Ex. 119 I, where carpet ``naturally contaminated'' for year by friable,
TSI and surfacing ACM was cleaned using three cleaning methods; all personal samples were below 0.022 f/cc; using
allowable methods resulted in the highest personal sample of 0.019 f/cc; see also, data in Ex. 162&hyph;52). Other
data show even lower exposures for custodial work (see for example, Wickman et al, Ex. L163, where the authors conclude:
``This study determined that custodians who performed routine activities in buildings which contained friable
asbestos materials were not exposed to levels of airborne asbestos which approached the OSHA action level of 0.1 f/cc.
The arithmetic mean value for 38 personal samples, analyzed by TEM, was 0.0009 s/cc, 8 hour TWA for structure lengths
greater than 5 &mu;m'' ( Id at 20). The much higher exposure data from the earlier Sawyer study, (Ex. 84&hyph;262A),
showed exposure levels ranging to 4.0 f/cc for dry dusting of bookshelves under friable ACM. As noted above, at this
rulemaking hearing Sawyer noted that the conditions in the building he studied were unrepresentative of other buildings
in the U.S. (Tr. 2157).

OSHA believes the Wickman report is the most complete study available concerning custodial exposures. Because the
study was submitted into the record after the close of the post-hearing comment periods, OSHA is not relying on it to
prove the extent of exposures anticipated in most custodial work. Rather, OSHA views the Wickman study as confirming
its view that Class IV activities result in reduced exposure and thus, reduced risk compared to activities of other
classes. Because maintenance work involving active ``disturbances'' is Class III work, the ``contact'' with ACM
which constitutes Class IV work will be either with intact materials, or in cleaning-up debris from friable material
or from material which has been disturbed. The latter activities present the higher risk potential. OSHA acknowledges
that evidence of asbestos disease among school custodians and maintenance workers has been submitted to this record
(See e.g., references cited in SEIU's post hearing brief, Ex. 144). The Agency believes that significant exposures
to custodians result from Class III work or when they clean up accumulations of friable material. Therefore, these
revisions contain several requirements aimed at reducing custodial exposures when cleaning up asbestos debris
and waste material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the work practices and precautions prescribed in these regulations will virtually eliminate
significant health risks for custodial workers, and will cure any confusion about which protections and which standards
will apply to custodial worker (see submission of SEIU, Ex. 144). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Custodial work is covered in all three standards. Housekeeping provisions in the general industry standard, paragraph
(k), cover custodians in public and commercial buildings, in manufacturing and other industrial facilities, where
construction activity is not taking place. To avoid confusion, and to cover clean-up, and other housekeeping on construction
sites, which properly is covered under the construction standard, similar ``housekeeping'' provisions are included
in the construction and shipyard standards as well (Paragraph (1). These housekeeping provisions are discussed
separately. The specific provisions in paragraph (g), relating to Class IV work in the construction standard relate
to construction work only, and are not necessarily limited to housekeeping. Like all other construction work, competent
person supervision of Class IV work is required, exposure assessments of clean-up of waste and debris, and use of HEPA
filtered vacuums, in paragraph (g)(1) apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Particular requirements were adopted in response to concerns of some participants. These are paragraph (g)(9) which
requires specific awareness training for Class IV workers. Under the 1986 standard, training was not required unless
employees were exposed above the action level, then 0.1 f/cc. Two labor organizations representing employees who
perform Class IV work, SEIU and AFSCME, and other participants, (see e.g., Ex. 141, 144), noted that custodial workers
needed training, separate from other building service workers, such as maintenance workers (Ex. 141 at 49), generally
referred to as ``awareness training.'' The record shows the lack of awareness that material contained asbestos contributed
to asbestosis (Tr. 959 ff). Paragraph (g)(9) of the construction and shipyard standards requires that Class IV asbestos
jobs be performed by employees trained according to the awareness training set out in the training section, (k)(8).
The general industry standard, also requires that employees who work in areas where ACM or PACM is present, also be
so trained, in paragraph (j). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, paragraph (g) requires employees cleaning up waste and debris in a regulated area where respirators
are required to be worn to also wear respirators. This restatement of the provision in paragraph (e)(4) relating to
regulated areas emphasizes that clean-up workers in large-scale jobs must wear respirators, even though the actual
removal is completed. Paragraph (g)(g)(iv) offers significant protection to custodians. As pointed out by participants,
custodians have swept up ``insulation debris which had fallen to the floor because it was so badly deteriorated *&blank;*&blank;*
with no knowledge or concern about asbestos hazards *&blank;*&blank;*'' (see testimony of Ervin Arp at Tr. 962&hyph;969).
This new provision requires that ``(e)mployees cleaning up waste and debris in an area where friable TSI and surfacing
ACM is accessible, shall assume that such waste and debris contains high-risk ACM. Since paragraph (k) requires that
such ACM and PACM be visibly labelled, OSHA believes that custodial workers will be spared the consequences of being
required to clean-up unidentified materials, which in fact contain asbestos.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Various participants asked OSHA to require an employer to adopt and operations and management (O&amp;M) program
to protect custodial and maintenance workers. The Agency notes that the 1986 standard contained, in non-mandatory
Appendix G, such a program, which listed precautionary actions which the Agency recommended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has not adopted an explicit O&amp;M program requirement in these standards. Rather, the Agency has adopted enforceable
provisions which cover the major elements of the previous non-mandatory program in the appendix, and of various programs
suggested by participants in this rulemaking. For example, the new requirement that maintenance and custodial work
be the subject of exposure assessments, [see paragraph (f)(2)], requires the competent person to evaluate operations
which may expose employees to asbestos, in order to minimize exposure. The requirement is ``operation'' based; rather
than, as in an O&amp;M program, status-based. However, any active disturbance constitutes an operation. Although
each ``operation'' must be covered by an exposure assessment, operations can be grouped. Cleaning up debris in an
area containing deteriorating ACM on a daily basis, need not be evaluated each day. An assessment of such activity
can be made on a general basis, covering procedures for wet sweeping and vacuuming, disposal, and instructions to
detect deterioration of material which contributes to the debris. Additionally, labelling of ACM and PACM usually
considered part of an O&amp;M program, is separately required, as is training of custodial workers. Specific jobs
may require specific instructions; the breadth of some are indicated by O&amp;M documents generated by the EPA ``Green
Book'' (Ex. 1&hyph;183, EPA 20T&hyph;2003, July 1990 and NIBS Ex. 1&hyph;371). OSHA believes that competent person
supervision of activities under this standard will provide appropriate work practices to be followed for relatively
small, less hazardous exposure situations. The Agency is requiring however, in the training provisions, that when
Class III and IV workers are trained, that the contents of the EPA or state approved courses for such workers, as the
relate to the work to be performed, be part of the required training material [paragraph (k)(v)(D)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of passive exposure, that is where active contact or disturbance of ACM is not a contributing factor to asbestos
fiber release, is covered by the various notification and identification provisions in the standard which will allow
employees to identify asbestos-containing material. These are discussed later in this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In OSHA's expert view, these provisions constitute major components of operations and maintenance programs recommended;
are aimed at the more significant sources of exposure for custodial workers, and most importantly, are enforceable.
For all these reasons, OSHA believes an explicit requirement for an O&amp;M program, such as suggested by AFSCME (Ex.
141 at 36), would add little benefit to employee health (see e.g., Tr.3500). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In each standard, OSHA is requiring specific work practices and a choice of engineeromg cpmtrp; however, OSHA is aware
that some asbestos control systems may be patented. OSHA has not considered the existence of patents or their validity
in evaluating the need for those controls. OSHA believes that all employers will have a variety of controls available
to them and that new types could be developed.

Paragraph (g) General Industry

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The 1986 general industry standard required respirator use where engineering and work practice controls are being
installed, in emergencies, and to reduce exposures to or below the PELs where feasible engineering controls and work
practices could not achieve these reductions. Additionally, certain operations i.e., cutting in plants, were shown
to have greater difficulties in achieving low exposures without respirator use. OSHA therefore allowed routine
respirator use in those segments to reach the PELS, rather than, as in other general industry segments, only where
the employer shows that feasible engineering and work practice controls cannot achieve compliance with the PELs.
OSHA now believes that engineering and work practices in the few remaining production sectors can achieve lower levels
than predicted in 1986, in part because of the mandatory work practices now included in the methods of compliance section.
Therefore, allowing respirator use at higher measured exposures for a few operations should not result in less protection
for those employees since their ambient exposure levels are expected to be reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h) Construction Standard and Shipyard Employment Standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The respirator provisions in the construction and shipyard employment standards are changed in several respects.
First, in addition to the conditions listed in the 1986 standards, where exposures exceed the PELs, required respirator
use now is triggered by kinds of activities even where the PELs are not exceeded. These are: Class I work, Class II work
where the ACM is not removed substantially intact; all Class II and III work where the employer cannot produce a negative
exposure assessment; and all Class IV work carried out in areas where respirators are required to be worn. OSHA has
based these decisions on the demonstrated variability during asbestos work, and on the need to protect workers who
are disturbing asbestos-containing material with the greatest potential for significant fiber release. In addition,
monitoring results for many jobs are not available in a timely fashion. By requiring routine respirator use in jobs
which OSHA finds are likely to result in hazardous airborne asbestos levels, such as floor tile removal, where most
tiles are broken, OSHA is providing reasonable supplemental protection to employees when certainty concerning
exposure levels is not possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The kind of respirators required for these ``conditions of use'' are set out in paragraphs (h)(iv) and (v). In one situation,
as explained below, Class I removals where excessive levels are predicted, ``supplied air respirators operated
in the positive pressure mode'' are required, because these jobs have the highest exposure potential, due to their
size, duration and the kinds of material involved. Other jobs where higher than usual exposures may occur include,
where employees are inexperienced, where TSI and surfacing ACM is disturbed, and where other ACM is broken up during
removal. Paragraph (h)(1) states the requirement for supplemental respirator use for these activities as well.
These additional respirator requirements conform to OSHA's findings on this record, of the specific conditions
which contribute to and are predictive of, higher exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed more fully in the classification section, the data submitted to the record show that in almost all cases
of removals and disturbances of non-high-risk ACM, exposure levels are well below the protection factor limits for
negative-pressure half-mask respirators, the type required for certain kinds of Class II and III work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BCTD has recommended that OSHA require the use of ``the most effective respirator that is feasible under the circumstances''
and further that OSHA require ``supplied air respirators which are tight fitting and in a pressure demand mode with
either auxiliary SCBA or a HEPA egress cartridge *&blank;*&blank;* except in limited circumstances which include
lack of feasibility because of the configuration of the work environment or an uncorrectable safety hazard'' (Ex.
143 at 65&hyph;69). BCTD does recognize safety hazards due to the tripping hazard of air lines to which SARs are attached
and define certain activities in which PAPRs may be used instead. (Ex. 143 at 71). BCTD also contended that the protection
factors used by OSHA to assign respirator classes are contrary to record evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court found that OSHA's judgment about supplied air respirators was properly within its discretion. It expressed
concern that OSHA's respirator requirements did appear to require only that the combined effect of engineering and
work practice controls and respirators limit exposure only as low as the PEL where significant risk remained (838
F.2d at 1274).

OSHA responded to these issues in a Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication of 5 February 1990 (55 FR 3727), in which the Agency reaffirmed its position concerning effectiveness
levels of respirators, pointed out flaws in studies BCTD used to conclude that protection factors are inadequate,
and noted that OSHA is revising and updating its general respirator standard. OSHA also noted that implementation
of the entire respirator program would result in exposures below the PEL. That was OSHA's final statement of position
on these issues and it was not judicially challenged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating the respiratory protection needs dictated by the new system of ranking for asbestos operations by ``class,''
OSHA has concluded that there are circumstances in which the highest level of respiratory protection must be used.
These are Class I jobs for which a negative exposure assessment (i.e. exposures will be less than the PEL) has not been
made. Inexperienced workers removing large amounts of TSI or surfacing ACM are at the high end of the risk spectrum
and must have additional protection afforded by the supplied air respirator. OSHA notes that joint EPA-NIOSH recommendations
would require a supplied air respirator in even more extensive circumstances, i.e., all ``abatement'' work and maintenance
and some repair work (EPA/NIOSH Guide, referenced at Ex. 143, p. 69). The Agency''s decision balances the acknowledge
potential safety hazards of supplied air respirators with the need for more protection in the most risky asbestos
jobs. The Court of Appeals has agreed that such judgments are properly within the discretion of the Agency (858 F2d
at 1274). In situations where the competent person makes a determination that exposures in Class I jobs will be less
than the PELs, the standard requires that a half-mask air purifying, non-disposable respirator equipped with a high
efficiency filter must be used. There are two reasons for this requirement: exposures less than the PEL have been determined
to result in significant risk, the record shows that Class I work may result in substantial exposures even when good
conditions exist, and the variability usually results in some high exposures. However, although all classes of asbestos
work are potentially risky, OSHA has used discretion, and has limited the supplied air respirator provision to the
highest risk situations, Class I work where it cannot be predicted that exposures will not exceed the PEL. This approach
does not leave workers doing other classes of work unprotected. The respirator selection Table D&hyph;4, applies
to all situations other than Class I work. As the worker(s) gain experience in the use of control methodology, and data
accrues documenting low fiber levels, use of less protective respirators may be allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, OSHA has based this conclusion on the demonstrated variability of exposures in the construction industry
(Ex. 143, p. 63, CONSAD report p. 2.18, Tr. 2156, 2157, Tr. 4571, Ex. 7&hyph;57). The contractor Consad reported ``while
many of the construction jobs monitored did not produce exposure levels above the proposed PEL of 0. 1 f/cc, these data
also provide continued evidence that exposure levels can be highly variable in construction work and can exceed the
proposed PEL *&blank;*&blank;* for many of the construction activities examined here'' (Ex. 8, 2.18&hyph;20).

The Committee has determined that advances in quantitative fit testing instrumentation have made this procedure
accessible to shipyards conducting asbestos operations at a cost which is not overly burdensome ($5,000&hyph;6,000
at the low end). Because quantitative fit testing provides a better evaluation of fit among respirators than qualitative
methods, and does not rely on subjective determination by the employees, qualitative fit testing methods have been
deleted as acceptable alternatives *&blank;*&blank;* (Ex. 7&hyph;77).

They further recommended, based on the recent developments in technology that the use of test chambers, and the requirement
for use of aerosols be deleted. They also offered an additional definition: ``challenge agent'' means the air contaminant,
or parameter, which is measured for comparison inside and outside of the respirator facepiece.'' These are reasonable
suggestions, but as they have general application outside shipyards, OSHA indicated this in its notice of February
5, 1990 in its partial response to the Court. The Agency is ``still planning to revise and update its general respiratory
standard, and believes that continuing to enforce the current asbestos respirator requirements during this interim
period will not expose employees to unnecessary risk'' (55 FR 3728, February 5, 1990). Therefore, OSHA will not delete
the qualitative fit test from the asbestos standard(s), but will consider the issue in the context of the general respiratory
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SESAC objected to the requirement that a powered, air-purifying respirator be supplied in lieu of a negative-pressure
respirator when the employee chooses it and when it will provide adequate protection. They felt that the employer
should be allowed to provide an airline respirator or powered air-purifying respirator. They reasoned that most
employers already will have airline respirators in stock and will not need to purchase or maintain any other type of
respirator. In evaluating similar comments in the rulemaking for the 1986 revised asbestos rule, OSHA stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA agrees that positive-pressure supplied-air respirators provide a greater level of protection than do half-mask
negative-pressure respirators. OSHA believes that employers should have the flexibility to use any of the available
respirators that provide sufficient protection to reduce the exposures to levels below the PEL. Furthermore, the
safety problems associated with the use of supplied-air respirators cannot be ignored. OSHA believes that respirators
should be selected that both provide adequate protection from exposure to airborne asbestos fibers and minimize
the risk of accident and injury potentially caused by the use of cumbersome supplied-air respirators (51 FR p. 22719,
June 20, 1986, p. 22719).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After that rulemaking, BCTD challenged OSHA's refusal to make air supplied respirators mandatory. The Court accepted
OSHA's explanation_that supplied-air respirators had hazards of its own, and stated ``this sort of judgment *&blank;*&blank;*
(is) within OSHA's discretion in the absence of evidence supporting the view that the incremental asbestos safety
gains plainly exceed the incremental non-asbestos hazards'' (838 F.2d at 1274). OSHA reiterated these reasons in
its January 28, 1990 response to the Court's remand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, OSHA has determined on this record that supplied air respirators are required for Class I work
where a negative exposure assessment is not forthcoming, but not for other Class I work. Therefore, shipyard employees
doing the most hazardous work must wear this most protective respirator as well.

Paragraph (h) General Industry. OSHA is making no changes in the protective clothing provisions for general industry.
Paragraph (i) Construction and Shipyard Standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several protective clothing issues in this rulemaking. The first issue involves the impact of the Class
system on the personal protective clothing provisions. The existing standard requires that protective clothing
be provided and worn when exposures exceed the PEL. The revised standards maintain this requirement. In addition,
the revised standards require the use of personal protective clothing when Class I work is performed and when Class
III work involving TSI and surfacing ACM is performed in the absence of a negative exposure assessment. OSHA believes
that this change brings the standard in line with OSHA's 1986 intentions wherein the Agency believed that removal
of thermal insulation and surfacing materials would result in exposures that exceed the PEL. This rulemaking record
shows that some employers have developed control strategies that can reduce exposures below the PELs, for most of
the time. However, as previously discussed, work with high-risk materials has substantial potential for over-exposure.
Furthermore, studies have documented that in the past workers have brought asbestos contaminated clothing home
with them and thereby caused exposure and asbestos-related disease among family members. OSHA believes that this
standard must prevent such conditions, and the nature of Class I work and Class III work with high risk materials merits
special consideration. Nearly all rulemaking participants agree on this point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes however, that the judgment to require protective clothing for asbestos work is a subjective one, to some
extent, requiring judgment on the part of the competent person. The hazard from asbestos is associated with inhalation
of fibers that are in the air, not from asbestos that comes in contact with the skin, like some other chemical that OSHA
has regulated (such as methylenedianiline and benzene), which are absorbed through the skin and are systemic toxins.
Asbestos fibers that are on clothing can become airborne, so OSHA continues to believe that situations where airborne
fiber levels are high are also those which are likely to contaminate clothing. Therefore, the regulation continues
the requirement for protective clothing and its proper disposal/cleaning. OSHA does not believe, however, that
protective clothing is required for every operation involving asbestos.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1986 standards OSHA did not require that protective clothing be impermeable; in fact, OSHA responded to concerns
that disposable clothing which was impermeable not be permitted because it was claimed to contribute to heat stress
(see discussion at 51 FR 22722). Although the issue was not remanded to OSHA by the Court, several participants in the
current rulemaking focussed comment on the issue of whether OSHA should require work clothing during asbestos work
be impermeable to asbestos fibers in each of its asbestos standards. Most of those who addressed the issue expressed
support for having such a requirement (Exs. 7&hyph;10, 7&hyph;67, 7&hyph;69, 7&hyph;138, 7&hyph;192, 7&hyph;195,
1&hyph;242, Tr. 1122, 1142, 1950, 3003 and 3156). It should also be noted that several of these commenters were manufacturers
of such fabric or clothing. They also encouraged OSHA to set a requirement that all garments meet the requirements
of the ANSI standard 101&hyph;1985.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Charles Salzenberg of Dupont presented a study which was performed at their behest by A.D. Little which indicated
that neither shampooing the hair nor showering following simulated asbestos exposure completely removed fibers
from hair or skin (Ex. 76) to support their request for an impermeable clothing requirement. In response to questioning
about heat stress, he stated that:

We've had projects for years on improving the breathability of Tyvek and in fact we have some material that exhibits
improved breathability and the problem you always get when you get more breathability, you get more asbestos. There
doesn't seem *&blank;*&blank;* a way to have a perfect filter that keeps out all fibrous material but lets a lot of air

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA continues to believe that heat stress is also a concern in use of protective clothing made of impervious fabric.
It should again be noted that the route of exposure of asbestos fibers which creates a health hazard is inhalation,
not skin absorption. The Agency reiterates its belief that non-disposable work clothes provide sufficient protection
provided they are properly cleaned after work and laundered. The Agency agrees that disposable fiber-impermeable
clothing can be safely worn if ``employers *&blank;*&blank;* use appropriate work-rest regimens and provide heat
stress monitoring *&blank;*&blank;*'' (51 FR 22722). However, OSHA does not believe that totally impermeable clothing
is a necessary requirement for asbestos work.

Paragraph (j) Construction and Shipyard Employment Standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is changing the decontamination requirements in minor details to correspond to its new system of categorizing
asbestos work according to its potential risk. The primary requirement that asbestos abatement workers be decontaminated
following their work using a 3-part system_an equipment room, a shower room, and a clean room, is retained. Thus, most
workers performing Class I work, removing TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM, as before, must use a shower adjacent to and
connected with the work area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the introduction of new provisions identifying 4 classes of asbestos work, it is necessary that OSHA modify its
requirement for hygiene facilities and practices to reflect these changes. OSHA continues in its belief that the
requirements must be proportional to the magnitude and likelihood of asbestos exposure. Therefore the most hazardous
asbestos operations_those involving removal of more than threshold amounts of thermal system insulation or sprayed-on
or troweled-on surfacing materials must employ a decontamination room adjacent to the regulated area (most often,
a negative-pressure enclosure) consisting of an equipment room, shower room, and clean room in series through which
workers must enter and exit the work area, as required in the 1986 standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For Class I asbestos work, OSHA has further determined, based on its consideration of the rulemaking record, that
there are 3 exceptions to the requirement that the shower facility be located immediately contiguous to the work area.
These include, outdoor work (See Ex. 7&hyph;21, 7&hyph;99, 7&hyph;145), shipboard work (Ex. 7&hyph;77 and see discussion
below), and situations where the employer shows such an arrangement is infeasible. OSHA will again allow in these
limited circumstances the workers to enter the equipment room, remove contamination from their worksuits using
a portable HEPA vacuum or change to a clean non-contaminated workclothing, and then proceed to the non-contiguous
shower area. Outdoor work affected by this requirement will occur mainly in industrial facilities such as refineries
and electrical power plants when specified work practices are employed and following outdoor asbestos work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA intends that HEPA-vacuuming procedures be performed carefully and completely remove any visible ACM/PACM
from the surface of the worker's work suit, including foot and head coverings, skin, hair and any material adhering
to the respirator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also for Class I work involving less than 10 square feet or 25 linear feet of TSI or surfacing ACM (the thresholds referenced
above), during which exposures are unlikely to exceed the PELs for which there is a negative exposure assessment,
OSHA is allowing less burdensome decontamination procedures which it believes are compatible with the scheme to
classify asbestos work according to risk potential. In these operation, an equipment room or area must be set up adjacent
to the work area for decontamination use. The floor of the area/room must be covered with an impermeable (e.g., plastic)
dropcloth and be large enough to accommodate equipment cleaning and removal of PPE without spread of fibers beyond
the area. The worker must HEPA vacuum workclothing, hair, head covering as described above and dispose of clothing
and waste properly. Thus, only if the employer shows that for these smaller dimension jobs that the PEL is unlikely
to be exceed may the decontamination procedure be abbreviated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For asbestos operations which are Class II and III which are likely to exceed the PELs and for which a negative exposure
assessment is not produced, showering is required, but may be performed in a facility which is non-contiguous to the
work area. Use of dropcloths, HEPA vacuuming of workclothing and surfaces as above or the donning of clean workclothing
prior to moving to a non-contiguous shower is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following those Class II, III and IV jobs which the employer demonstrates are unlikely to exceed the PELs and for which
a negative exposure assessment has been produced, the worker must HEPA vacuum his clothing on an impermeable dropcloth
and perform other clean-up on the dropcloth avoiding the spread of any contamination. However, showering is not required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is also concerned that workers performing clean-up (Class IV work) following larger abatement work receive
appropriate decontamination. Therefore, employees who perform Class IV work in a regulated area must comply with
the hygiene practice which the higher classification of work being performed in the regulated area requires.

In other comments the Shipyards Employment Standards Advisory Committee objected to the requirement in the 1986
standard that showers be located contiguous to the work area. They said that this was not a part of the general industry
standard and that they wished to continue to provide showers in fixed facilities on shore; that although contiguous
showers may not be technologically infeasible, it was impractical. They further stated that change rooms required
under the general industry asbestos standard cannot be provided on ships and that the worker must be allowed to remove
contaminated clothing in an equipment room as in the construction standard (Ex. 7&hyph;77). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee suggested several specific steps to the decontamination process required of workers following work
in a shipboard asbestos activity. According to these recommendations, the employer shall ensure that employees
who work within regulated area exit as follows:

Remove asbestos from their protective clothing using a HEPA vacuum as they move into the equipment room;

receptacles provided for that purpose;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Remove respirator after exiting decontamination room; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If they are not going to make another entry into the regulated area that day, proceed to the shower area and change room;
and,

OSHA believes these are reasonable suggestions. The final standard permits this approach based on the flexibility
permitted by the language. Those who shower at remote facilities are required to decontaminate their protective
clothing prior to proceeding to the remote showers. The Committee also recommended that, for the sake of modesty,
the worker must be allowed to continue to wear the underwear which he had worn under his protective clothing during
the process of decontaminating his clothing_removing them when entering the shower. The 1986 standards are silent
on this point and it seems reasonable that persons would be allowed to continue to wear his/her underwear during HEPA
vacuuming and removal of protective clothing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``communication of hazards'' provisions of the standards contain many revisions. The Court in 1988 had remanded
two information transfer issues for OSHA's reconsideration. These were to extend the reporting and information
transfer requirements and to require construction employers to notify OSHA of asbestos work. As discussed earlier,
OSHA has decided not to require general pre-job notification to the Agency. However, the Agency has expanded required
notifications among owners, employers and employees. Basically, the general industry standard has been upgraded
to the more extensive notification requirements of the construction standard and the shipyard employment standards.
Consequently this preamble section discusses the issues together. In the shipyard standard the ``building owner''
may be a vessel owner or a building owner. OSHA notes that in shipyards vessels undergoing repair may be owned by foreign
entities, as well as by entities subject to the Act's jurisdiction. When a foreign-owned vessel is repaired in an American
shipyard, the employer (either the shipyard or an outside contractor) must either treat materials defined as PACM
as asbestos-containing or sample the suspect material and analyze it to determine whether or not it contains asbestos.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An overview of these revisions follows. The construction and shipyard standards now require that employers who discover
the presence of material which is ACM or is presumed ACM (PACM) on the worksite, must notify the project or building
owner. On worksites having multi-employers, the person who discovers the material also is to notify the other employers.
An employer on a multi-employer worksite who is planning Class I or Class II asbestos work is to inform all the other
employers on the site of the presence of ACM to which employees of those employers might reasonably be expected to be
exposed. They are to be informed of the location and quantity of these materials and the measures to be taken to protect
them from exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1986 construction standard required employers to notify other employers on multi-employer worksites of the
existence and location of asbestos work, but was silent on the notification role of building owners. OSHA was concerned
that building owners were ``outside the domain of the OSH Act.'' As noted above, this is a specific issue remanded for
reconsideration by the Court of Appeals. Now, upon reconsideration, OSHA believes that it has authority to require
building owners [as defined in paragraph (b)] who are statutory employers, to take necessary and appropriate action
to protect employees other than their own. In the 1990 proposal OSHA pointed to other standards in which it has required
building owners and other employers who are not the direct employers of the employees exposed to particular hazards,
to warn of defects, take remedial action, or provide information to the directly employing employer. It cited the
Hazard Communication Standard's requirement that manufacturers provide information to downstream employers
(29 CFR 1910.1200) and the Powered Platform standard which requires the building owner to assure the contract employer
that the building and equipment conform to specified design criteria as examples (29 CFR 1910.66(c).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the building or project owner is the best and often the only source of information concerning the
location of asbestos installed in structures; therefore, OSHA is requiring the owner to receive, maintain, and communicate
knowledge of the location and amount of ACM or PACM to employers of employees who may be exposed. OSHA acknowledges
that in shipyards, foreign vessel owners are not ``statutory employers'' and thus, are not covered by these standards.
In such cases, the employer performing the ``refit'' must either presume that TSI and surfacing material are asbestos-containing,
or have the material tested. When turn-around time must be minimized, the case in many overhauls, OSHA expects that
the jobs will be performed in conformity with this standard without testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule provides a comprehensive notification scheme for affected parties_building owners, contract employers
and employees, which will assure that information concerning the presence, location, and quantity of ACM or PACM
in buildings is communicated in a timely manner to protect employees who work with or in the vicinity of such materials.
Before Class I, II, or III work is initiated, building and/or project owners must notify their own employees and employers
who are bidding on such work, of the quantity and location of ACM and PACM present in such areas. Owners also must notify
their own employees who work in or adjacent to such jobs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Employers, who are not owners, planning any such covered activity must notify the owner of the location and quantity
of ACM and PACM known or later discovered. The building owner must keep records of all information received through
this notification scheme, or through other means, which relates to the presence, location and quantity of ACM and
PACM in the owner's building/project or vessel and transfer all such information to successive owners. OSHA reaffirms
its finding of the 1986 standard that an employee's presence in the workplace places him at increased risk from asbestos
exposure regardless of whether he/she is actually working with asbestos or is just in the vicinity of such material.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has defined ``building owner'' to include these lessees who control the management and recordkeeping functions
of a building /facility/vessel. It is not OSHA's intention to exempt the owner from notification requirements by
allowing a lessee to comply. Rather when the owner has transferred the management of the building to a long-term lessee,
that lessee is the more appropriate party to receive, transmit, and retain information about in-place asbestos.
When a lease has expired, any records in the lessee's possession must be transferred to the owner or the subsequent
lessee exercising similar managerial authority. The expanded notification provisions also require that on multi-employer
worksites, any employer planning to perform work which will be in a regulated area, before starting, must notify the
building owner of the location of the ACM and the protective measures taken; upon discovering unexpected ACM, they
must provide similar notification; and, upon work completion they must provide to the owner a written record of the
remaining ACM at the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has included a provision that within 10 days of the completion of Class I or II asbestos work, the employer of the
employees who performed the work shall inform the owner and employers of employees who will be working in the area of
the current location and quantity of PACM and/or ACM remaining in the former regulated area and shall also inform him/her
of the final monitoring results taken in that operation. OSHA has determined that the employer of employees reoccupying
the area must have this information in order to provide the appropriate protection to his/her workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To provide effective notification in Class III asbestos operations, OSHA is building upon its earlier requirement
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
post
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 warning signs in regulated areas. Now since all Class III work must be conducted in a regulated area all maintenance-type
operations will be posted with signs, which state the fact that asbestos exposing activities are present. OSHA considers
site posting to be a particularly effective means to alert employees of hazardous areas where relatively short-term
repair and maintenance activities are taking place. OSHA believes that site posting will adequately notify potentially
affected employees who are not working on the operation, but are working within the area or adjacent to it.

Identification of Asbestos-containing Materials in Buildings and Facilities

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the ``notification'' issues just discussed, OSHA addresses a related widespread concern expressed
by participants in this rulemaking: how to ensure that workers in buildings and facilities with previously installed
asbestos containing products, are not exposed to asbestos fibers merely because they have no knowledge of where such
products were installed. OSHA has found that such workers, primarily maintenance workers and custodians, but also
contract workers such as plumbers, carpenters and sheet metal workers and workers in industrial facilities have
shown historic disease patterns which in large part resulted from exposure to previously installed asbestos. (see
discussions elsewhere in this preamble of data submitted by BCTD, AFSCME, SEIU and others). In its 1990 proposal OSHA
raised the issue of how to identify previously installed asbestos and asked for comments and recommendations (55
FR 29730). OSHA opened the record for supplemental comments in November 1992, in a notice which also set out OSHA's
preliminary views on how to effectively protect workers from unknowing exposure to previously installed ACM (57
FR 49657). There, OSHA proposed to require employers to presumptively identify certain widely prevalent and more
risky materials. These are thermal system insulation, and sprayed-on and troweled-on surfacing materials, in buildings
built between 1920 and 1980. These materials were to be termed ``presumed asbestos containing materials'' (PACM)
and were to be treated as asbestos containing for all purposes of the standard. OSHA would have allowed building owners
and employers to rebut these presumptions using building records and/or bulk sampling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final provisions which are included in all three standards, like OSHA's 1992 approach, require building owners
and employers to presume that thermal system insulation (TSI) and sprayed-on and troweled-on surfacing materials
contain asbestos, unless rebutted pursuant to the criteria in the standard. Additionally, OSHA is requiring in its
mandatory work practices for flooring material containing asbestos, that employers assume that resilient flooring
material consisting of vinyl sheeting, and vinyl and asphalt containing tile installed before 1980 also be presumed
to contain asbestos (see discussion in the ``Methods of Compliance'' section). Unlike the proposal, buildings constructed
before 1920 are not excluded from these requirements. Also rebuttal criteria have been changed. Unlike the approach
OSHA suggested in the November, 1992 notice, building records may 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be relied upon to rebut the presumption of asbestos containing material and more detailed instructions are supplied
for the inspection process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that these provisions will protect employees in buildings and facilities from the consequences of
unknowing significant exposure to asbestos in the most cost-effective manner.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants supported OSHA's ``presumptive'' approach to identifying asbestos-containing material; in particular,
designating only TSI and surfacing ACM for presumptive treatment (see e.g., utility companies such as Southern Cal.
Edison, Ex. 162&hyph;4; Con Edison, Ex. 162&hyph;54; Duke Power, Ex. 162&hyph;57; property management companies
and associations, e.g., JMB Properties, Ex. 162&hyph;29; trade associations, e.g., O.R.C., Ex. 162&hyph;12; International
Council of Shopping Centers, Ex. 162&hyph;58). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the November 1992, OSHA continues to believe that the major advantage of such a regulatory approach is
that the materials and buildings/facilities with the greatest risk potential would be automatically targeted for
mandatory communication and control procedures, and possible testing. Focusing on high-risk building/facility
situations avoids the dilution of resources and attention which might result from requiring broader inspections.
Other building/facility areas and material would not be exempt from the standard's control requirements; however,
they would not be presumptively considered to contain asbestos. If a building owner or employer has actual knowledge
of the asbestos content of materials, they must comply with the protective provisions in the standard. Similarly
if there is good cause to know that material is asbestos containing the employer and/or building owner is deemed to
know that fact. The current enforcement rules governing ``employer knowledge'' would be applied in a contested case
to determine the application of the asbestos standard to other materials or building/facility areas which the employer
claims he did not know contained asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that this presumptive approach allows building/facility owners whose buildings/facilities contain
PACM and other employers of employees potentially exposed to PACM flexibility to choose the most cost-effective
way to protect employees. They may treat the material as if it contains asbestos and provide appropriate required
training to the custodial staff; test the material and rebut the presumptions; or combine strategies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA considered a number of approaches to insure that workers do not become exposed to asbestos unknowingly. As noted
in the 1992 notice, one option was clarifying in the preamble to the final rule the current enforcement policy that
a prudent building/facility owner or other employer exercising ``due diligence'' is expected to identify certain
asbestos-containing materials in his/her building/facility before disturbing them. After reviewing the record,
OSHA believes its presumption approach is more protective. ``Due diligence,'' is, in part, a legal defense, invoked
by and in order to shelter employers against OSHA citation. Thus in the past, employers who were wrongly informed by
building owners about the asbestos content of thermal system insulation successfully argued in some cases that they
had exercised ``due diligence.'' OSHA believes that the protection of employees must not depend on the good faith
of their employers whose information sources may be defective. By requiring that TSI and troweled- and sprayed-on
surfacing material be handled as if they contain asbestos, employees will be protected from the consequences of their
employers relying on erroneous information about the most risky asbestos materials. Of course, ``due diligence''
would also require employers to investigate whether other building material about which there was information suggesting
asbestos content, was in fact asbestos-containing. A building owner/employer, for other materials, also may presume
they are asbestos-containing, label and treat work with them as asbestos work, without testing the material for asbestos
content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another option OSHA considered was requiring a comprehensive AHERA-type (EPA's schools rule) building/facility
inspection. AHERA (Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act, 40 CFR 735) requires that all school buildings be visually
inspected for asbestos-containing building materials (ACBM) by an EPA-accredited inspector and that inventory
of the locations of these materials be maintained. Under AHERA, school maintenance and custodial staff who may encounter
ACBM in the course of their work receive at least 2 hours of awareness training, and for staff who conduct activities
which disturb ACBM, an additional 14.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Requiring comprehensive building and facility inspections like EPA does under AHERA was recommended by participants
presenting labor interests (e.g., AFSCME Ex. 162&hyph;11; SEIU, 162&hyph;28; AFL-CIO, Ex. 162&hyph;36; BCTD,
Ex. 162&hyph;42): by engineering, management and asbestos abatement firms, (e.g., Abatement Systems, Inc. Ex.
162&hyph;8, California Association of Asbestos Professionals, Ex. 162&hyph;27); and by representatives of state
health agencies (e.g., North Carolina Department of Health and Natural Resources, Ex. 162&hyph;46; N.Y.C. Department
of Environmental Protection, Ex. 162&hyph;47). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there was substantial support for a comprehensive inspection requirement, OSHA believes that the regulatory
approach in these final standards will achieve equivalent or superior protection to exposed workers at much reduced
cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons are as follows. A comprehensive wall-to-wall inspection requirement is found to be unnecessary to protect
employees against risks of exposure from asbestos-containing building material of which they are unaware. Such
an inspection requirement would be very costly, may be overly broad, the results may not be correct or timely, would
not necessarily focus on potential sources of asbestos exposure which present significant risks to employees, and
its great expense may divert resources from active protection of workers who actually disturb asbestos. First, OSHA
does not believe that protecting employees in buildings from significant asbestos exposure requires that all suspect
materials in buildings first be identified. Although all asbestos-containing materials may release fibers when
their matrices are disturbed, certain materials are known to be more easily damaged or to suffer more deterioration,
and thus cause higher airborne fiber levels than others. As discussed in the November 1992 notice, OSHA determined
that thermal system insulation (TSI) and sprayed on and troweled on surfacing materials are such materials. They
are potentially more friable, are much more prevalent, are more accessible and are the subject of more maintenance
and repair activities than are other asbestos containing materials. They are widely prevalent. A 1984 EPA study limited
to residential, commercial and public buildings nationally, found about three quarters of such buildings had asbestos-containing
TSI, and over one quarter of the buildings contained sprayed-on or troweled-on asbestos containing surfacing material
(see also studies cited in the HEI Report, Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 4&hyph;6 to 4&hyph;10). The materials are usually accessible.
Surfacing material was applied for decorative and acoustical purposes early on, and was later applied as insulation
coating to protect structural steel during fires. The HEI Report in summarizing studies conducted in New York, California,
and Philadelphia stated that ``(i)mportant findings from these studies include the frequent use of friable surfacing
in multi-storied buildings and the high proportion of damage to thermal systems insulation, most of which is accessible
only to maintenance personnel (HEI Report, Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 4&hyph;8 to 10). The accessibility of thermal system
insulation is not limited to employees who directly disturb it to repair or replace the piping and infrastructure
it covers. As noted by a participant: in industrial settings there are many sources of fiber release including vibration
(people often walk on pipes), exposure to the elements, fans and processes, leaks, process leaks, and releases through
joints in metal cladding (Ex. 12&hyph;7, Respirable Fibers Management Consultancy, Inc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted to OSHA indicate that these two materials have high exposure potential. For example, the potential
of surfacing material to become friable and result in sizable exposures was shown by the Yale Architecture School
data, which involved exposure to a ``fully exposed acoustical material,'' a ``Spanish moss type material'' of low
density and high friability (Tr. 2168). Dr. Sawyer, whose study showed very high exposures to custodial employees
from exposure to dust and debris from this material, noted that its use in the building was unrepresentative, and that
the material usually is ``used primarily as a fireproofing material on structural steel that was concealed.'' (Id).
Work in ceiling spaces containing sprayed asbestos show elevated exposure levels (see e.g., studies discussed in
HEI, Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 4&hyph;74). Data showing high exposure levels from TSI are ample and are discussed in detail
in the preamble discussion on methods of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data in this record showing exposures to other kinds of asbestos containing material such as gaskets, wallboard,
roofing and siding materials show that generally, exposures to these products under comparable controls are lower
than those released by the materials designated by OSHA as ``high hazard'' and for which the presumption applies.
The ``high-hazard'' materials are much more prevalent in buildings and facilities, disturbances of them are more
common. Therefore OSHA believes that a targeted approach to presuming the presence of high hazard previously installed
asbestos containing materials in buildings which are likely to contain them will provide equivalent protection
to potentially exposed employees than a requirement to inspect all buildings and facilities for all asbestos containing
materials. Some building owners will continue to conduct comprehensive surveys, others, when cost is an issue, will
rely on presumptions to protect employees from potential exposure to high-risk ACM, TSI and surfacing materials.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, even an up-front inspection rule must be targeted to be productive. Since not all facilities contain
asbestos materials, an attempt should be made to designate those facilities and buildings where it unlikely that
ACM will be found, otherwise the information yield from inspections will be unconnected to worker protection. OSHA
is using a temporal cut-off of 1980 for its presumption rule. As discussed later, this date was supported by the record,
since buildings constructed afterwards are much less likely to contain even stockpiled asbestos containing materials.
In 1975, under the authority of the Clean Air Act, EPA banned the use of spray-applied ACM as insulation and the use of
asbestos-containing pipe lagging and in 1978 extended the ban to all uses of sprayed-on asbestos. In this regard OSHA
notes that the purpose of a cut-off is not to state a date after which it is certain that no asbestos-containing material
has been installed in buildings. Rather, it is to designate when it becomes unlikely that asbestos-containing materials
have been used in construction. OSHA believes that 1980 is a reasonable date for marking that probability. As noted
above, employers and building owners are still required to investigate materials installed after 1980 when they
suspect they may be asbestos-containing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, OSHA additionally refined its presumption by recognizing two broad categories of building materials
as ``high-risk'' and thus that the consequences of a false negative identification supported a such materials be
treated as asbestos-containing unless reliable information showed the absence of asbestos. These kinds of materials
are TSI and sprayed-on, troweled-on, or otherwise applied surfacing materials. Although as noted the version of
an inspection rule urged by most proponents would require inspection for all potential asbestos-containing materials,
some participants suggested an inspection requirement which would also concentrate on more potentially hazardous
materials first. One suggestion was to, first require inspection of steel structures with sprayed on fireproofing
constructed before 1975, next of sprayed-on acoustic ceiling installed before 1980 (e.g., Ex. 162&hyph;27). In
the Agency's view, phasing in inspection requirements may provide less certainty and protection than its presumption
approach. Requiring a ``presumption'' is an immediate source of protection. Any inspection program takes time and
significant resources. Additionally, if inspection of categories of potentially high risk material are delayed
under a phased-in-approach, protection is denied pending the start-up date. If judicial challenge is made employers
may hold back on any inspections hoping for a court to invalidate the requirement. Even more importantly, evidence
in the record also indicates that inspection data sometimes are not reliable. In particular, the Westat Report which
evaluated a large sample of school inspections under AHERA, found that although on the whole inspections identified
most asbestos-containing materials, ``high-risk'' surfacing material was unidentified as asbestos containing
in 36% of the inspections studied (Ex. 1&hyph;326 p. 326). Since surfacing material has been found by OSHA, based on
this record to be a high hazard material, OSHA is reluctant to rely on inspections alone to identify it. A presumptive
approach requires that material which looks like sprayed on or troweled on surfacing material, be handled with care,
without waiting for inspections or relying on the results of inspections which may not correctly identify it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency asked for comment on its intention to designate thermal system insulation and sprayed-on or troweled-on
surfacing material as ``high-risk material.'' Several of those responding to the notice felt the list was too limited
and should include all suspect materials ( Exs. 162&hyph;11, 162&hyph;16, 162&hyph;18, 162&hyph;24, 162&hyph;28,
162&hyph;33, 162&hyph;36, 162&hyph;39, 162&hyph;42, 162&hyph;44, 162&hyph;45, 162&hyph;46, 162&hyph;57).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Siebert of the Office of the Secretary of Defense offered an alternate plan_a tiered approach in which thermal system
insulation and sprayed-on or troweled-on surfacing materials would be considered high-risk PACM and would be labeled
and notification carried out: other material which may contain asbestos (Ex. 162&hyph;13). He suggested that other
material, should be handled as ACM unless sampling indicates that it does not contain asbestos, but that it not be required
to be labeled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As suggested, OSHA considered extending its presumption requirement to other kinds of building materials which
may contain asbestos. A limited extension has been made in two cases. Because of its accessibility and prevalence,
the frequent difficulty of identifying its asbestos content and the frequency of maintenance activity which may
disturb it matrix. The Agency is requiring that resilient flooring installed before 1980 be presumed to contain asbestos
unless rebutted pursuant to the standard. Debris which is present in rooms, enclosures or areas where PACM or high
risk ACM is present and not intact, is assumed to be asbestos-containing. Other building materials which may contain
asbestos such as roofing material, ceiling tiles and miscellaneous products listed in EPA's ``Green Book'' have
not been found to be both as widely prevalent and easily disturbed and damaged as are TSI and surfacing material or as
widely prevalent, accessible and frequently disturbed as resilient flooring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, OSHA believes little additional benefit will result from treating all such building materials which
uncommonly contain asbestos as if they do, rather than concentrating resources on protecting employees from exposure
to materials when there is actual knowledge or reason to believe they contain asbestos. OSHA notes in this regard that
an employer or building owner's duty to investigate the possibility that a material contains asbestos is stronger
when the consequences of failing to inquire is increased hazard to employees. For example, in the case where a large
section of damaged ceiling tiles installed before 1980 is to be removed, an employer may not ignore the possibility
that the tiles are asbestos-containing. By not including some building materials in the presumption OSHA is not reducing
an employer's duty to exercise ``due diligence'' when exposing employees to such kinds of materials. The Agency has
determined merely that the record does not compel the adoption of a presumption for such materials; in any such specific
case, circumstances may require the employer or building owner to sample and analyze building materials for asbestos
content, or to treat the material as if it is asbestos-containing under the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On a different issue, OSHA is not specifying in the regulatory text the qualifications of the person who may designate
materials as PACM. Under AHERA, inspections are required to be conducted by certified inspectors (40 CFR 763, also
see recent revisions of Model Accreditation under ASHARA, 59 FR 5236&hyph;5260, February 3, 1994). The Agency has
found that designation of the kinds of building materials as PACM is not an inspection. This process does not require
technical training: thermal system insulation is easily recognized; sprayed on or troweled on surfacing material
likewise is identifiable. Neither EPA's revised MAP nor OSHA requires specific training or accreditation of persons
who only visually inspect the condition of ACM/PACM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA emphasizes that the presumption must apply even where it appears to knowledgeable building personnel, that
material is not asbestos-containing and is composed of other materials, such as fiberglass. Therefore, OSHA has
not adopted the suggestion of some participants to specify that certain materials such as fiberglass and neoprene,
because they are easily identifiable, should not be included in the presumption (see Ex. 162&hyph;57). OSHA notes
that HEI distinguished a ``visual survey,'' i.e., the identification of suspect materials from more complete surveys,
and notes that ``this type of survey may minimize the need for trained consultants.'' (HEI, Ex. 1&hyph;344, at 5.1)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some participants suggested that OSHA include the condition of the material in its ``high-risk'' category to be subject
to the presumption. Although the condition of the material influences its risk potential, OSHA continues its practice
of not distinguishing materials based on their friability. However, the condition of the material is relevant to
whether debris, in the presence of ACM, must be presumed to be asbestos containing. The standard requires that debris
in an enclosed area where TSI or surfacing ACM is present, and not intact, be presumed to be asbestos-containing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has not used friability to distinguish among asbestos containing materials. First, OSHA mainly regulates active
disturbances of asbestos, and uses exposure levels as one element in assigning risk-based requirements. Since the
friability of material will influence exposure levels, friability is partly subsumed by this reference to exposure
levels. Second, the term's precise meaning is unclear, and thus, confusing to the regulated community. The EPA experience
in distinguishing risk categories based on friability indicates the complexity of using this concept. In 1973 the
EPA&hyph;NESHAP had regulated only friable ACM, but later issued a clarification which stated:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;*Even though the regulations address only material that is presently friable, it does not limit
itself to material that is friable at the time of notification. Rather, if at any point during the renovation of demolition
additional friable asbestos material is *&blank;*&blank;* created from non-friable forms, this additional friable
material becomes subject to the regulations from the time of creation (Ex. 1&hyph;239, p. 48406).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, OSHA's risk categories which are based on the type of material include the potential for friability. For example,
surfacing material is loosely bound and therefore is potentially more friable than are other materials and thus is
considered to present high risk.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised rule also allows the building/facility owner or employer to demonstrate, pursuant to specific criteria,
that the material does not contain asbestos. The criteria, specified in paragraph (k)(4)(ii) are similar to the inspection
protocols for schools in AHERA, such as sampling and analysis by a certified building inspector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also considered allowing the use of specific information in the building/facility owner's possession relating
to construction specifications to rebut the presumption. However, many who made submissions during the supplementary
comment period, pointed out to the Agency that building records were rarely adequate to convincingly establish the
absence of ACM in buildings and recommended that they should not be used for rebutting the presumption (Ex. 162&hyph;2,
162&hyph;4, 162&hyph;5, 162&hyph;7, 162&hyph;11, 162&hyph;12, 162&hyph;13, 162&hyph;19, 162&hyph;22, 162&hyph;24,
162&hyph;25, 162&hyph;27, 162&hyph;31, 162&hyph;32, 162&hyph;33, 162&hyph;36, 162&hyph;39, 162&hyph;42,
162&hyph;44, 162&hyph;45, 162&hyph;46, 162&hyph;54). Some felt that building records might be useful in confirming,
but not rebutting, the presumption, while others deemed the only reliable records were comprised of an AHERA-like
comprehensive building survey with bulk sampling data (Ex. 162&hyph;1, 162&hyph;12, 162&hyph;13, 162&hyph;24,
162&hyph;27, 162&hyph;36, 162&hyph;50, 162&hyph;58). An owner of commercial properties observed that he had often
found it easier to sample the PACM than to locate adequate documentation (Ex. 162&hyph;29). A group of environmental
lawyers recommended that since EPA in its NESHAP rule declined to rely on building records, OSHA should also for consistency
(Ex. 162&hyph;22). Members of a consulting firm, noted that before 1980, materials containing less than 5% asbestos
by volume were said to be asbestos-free (by EPA). Thus, such materials would be unlikely to appear on building records
if they had contained less than 5% asbestos (Ex. 162&hyph;7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering the numerous comments on the subject, most of which affirmed the general inadequacy of building records
to rebut the presumption, OSHA has not included this as a method to establish that a building material does 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contain asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (k)(1)(ii) and (k)(2)(ii) set out the notification provisions for owners and employers. They instruct
them concerning who must be notified of the presence of ACM/PACM and how. Briefly, owners must notify employers who
bid for work in or, as tenants, will occupy space where ACM/PACM is present. The owner must also notify employees who
will perform work subject to this standard in such areas before such work is begun. This work consists of Class I through
IV asbestos work, and the installation of new asbestos-containing material. Similar provisions apply to employers
who are not owners. [Paragraph (k)(2)(ii)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BCTD suggested that notice of ACM take place early in the contracting process (Ex. 162&hyph;42) and a representative
of the Interstate Natural Gas Association agreed that pre-bid notification of contractors was needed (Ex. 162&hyph;9).
OSHA agrees. Requiring notification to prospective contractors at bid time will improve employee protection. Knowledge
about asbestos presence gained after bidding may cause the bidder to dilute protection in order to salvage the bid.
Contractors may lose time and money if they conscientiously stop a job when asbestos is discovered. Other participants
echoed these reasons (see, e.g., NCRA, Tr. 2430&hyph;2432; Testimony of C. Gowan, Tr. 834&hyph;835.) Notifying
employers leasing space containing ACM was also recommended (Ex 162&hyph;29). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard provides that notification may be either in writing or via a personal communication between the owner
and persons owed notification or their authorized representatives. OSHA expects that in the case of contracts for
work to be performed, notifications will be included in the bid documents. In other cases it may be ``faxed,'' telephoned
or otherwise communicated. OSHA believes these notifications, supplemented by clarified labeling requirements
[see (k)(7)(vii)], and regulated area posting, will provide ample information to workers so they will not inadvertently
be exposed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the rulemaking, participants raised various issues concerning notification. Several participants wanted
accessibility to be a consideration in the approach (Exs. 162&hyph;5, 162&hyph;11, 162&hyph;14, 162&hyph;23,
162&hyph;29, 162&hyph;30, 162&hyph;33, 162&hyph;42, 162&hyph;49, 162&hyph;55, 162&hyph;58, 162&hyph;59),
and BCTD suggested that ``accessible'' be defined as ``material subject to disturbance by building or facility occupants
or maintenance personnel or workers performing renovation, repair or demolition inside and/or outside buildings''
(Ex. 162&hyph;42). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most agreed that PACM and/or ACM within areas such as mechanical rooms and boiler rooms should be labeled. For example,
Mr. Olson of Dow Chemical Company supported the posting of areas where those who may be exposed will see it before working
there (Ex. 162&hyph;17). A representative from the Department of Defense felt that general posting in public areas
would alarm building occupants and over time, lead to reduced credibility and effectiveness (Ex. 162&hyph;13).
This was echoed in the comments of J. Thornton of Newport News Shipbuilding who felt that signs ``may breed complacency''
(Ex. 162&hyph;21). One participant worried that perhaps a tenant considering renewing his lease who had been notified
of PACM within the building might choose to relocate even though there really was no asbestos-containing materials
actually present in the building (Ex. 162&hyph;20). OSHA has decided that ``accessibility'' is relevant to posting
information concerning the location of in-place asbestos. Paragraph (k)(7)(vii) requires labels to be attached
at ``accessible locations.'' OSHA agrees with BCTD's definition as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some representatives of contractor interests recommended that OSHA use as a model for notification the California
regulation by which the building owner provides written notification to all building employees, tenants, and contractors
(Exs. 162&hyph;27, 162&hyph;32). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted below, paragraph (k)(7)(vii) requires previously installed asbestos products to be labelled in most circumstances;
either visibly labeled in accordance with the standard, when feasible, or that information required on the label
be posted as close to the installed product as feasible. Information concerning other previously-installed asbestos-containing
products must be posted in mechanical rooms or other areas which are accessible where such material is present; or
if the products are installed in other areas, the building owner must otherwise make such information available to
employees who perform work covered by this standard. The provision exempts from labeling and posting those products
which the manufacturer demonstrates cannot release fibers in excess of the PELs. OSHA has found that this exemption
will never apply to PACM (TSI or surfacing ACM); rarely will it apply to other asbestos containing materials, because
on this record, disturbance of ACM 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
can
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exceed the PEL. As noted in the comments summarized above, there will be cases where labeling of such materials is not
feasible. In such case, the standard requires that signs or labels be displayed as close as feasible to such materials.
Additionally, housekeeping workers must be informed that all resilient flooring material they clean, buff or otherwise
maintain may contain asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the strategy for the flow of information regarding the presence and location of asbestos-containing
or presume-asbestos-containing materials it has developed in this revision of its standards will assure that workers
who might be exposed to asbestos within public and commercial buildings and/or facilities will be informed of the
potential for such exposure and through the training provisions will be made aware of the practices they are to use
to avoid exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To further assure the responsible transfer of information, OSHA is requiring that records of the work performed,
the location and quantity of ACM or PACM remaining at the completion of the work, and data supporting any rebuttal of
the presumption that a material contains asbestos, are to be maintained by the building/facility owner and are to
be transferred to successive owners of the building/facility. Further, in the event that ACM/PACM is inadvertently
encountered, OSHA has included a requirement for timely notification. If during the course of asbestos work ACM or
PACM is discovered at a worksite, within 24 hours of finding such material, information as to its location and quantity
are to be conveyed to the building owner and any other employers at the site.

Shipyard Standard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the reopening of the record for supplemental comments in November 1992, OSHA asked for comment on the application
of the proposed scheme for shipyards. There were few specific responses. J. Curran, State of North Carolina Department
of Environmental Health and Natural Resources (Ex. 162&hyph;46) and BCTD (Ex. 162&hyph;42) supported applying
the construction standard to shipyards. Mr. Siebert, a representative of the office of the Assistant Secretary of
Defense, agreed with others in wanting a separate standard for shipyards to be developed by SESAC (Ex. 162&hyph;13).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has accepted these suggestions and has issued a separate, final standard for shipyards. Its specific provisions
are discussed in appropriate places in the preamble. It is more similar to the new construction standard than to the
general industry standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (k)(8) covers training. It expands the training provisions of the current standard considerably. One,
training must be given to virtually all employees who are actively exposed to asbestos, i.e. whose exposure is the
result of performing Class I through IV work, or who install new asbestos products. Under the unrevised standard,
training was triggered by exposure above the action level, i.e. 0.1 f/cc, the new PEL. As discussed above, OSHA has
determined that there is a still significant risk at this level. Further, the Agency's experience in enforcing its
health and safety standards, along with testimony, comment, and data in this record clearly establish that training
of employees is a vital component of any successful program to control exposures to asbestos and other toxic substances.
Participants agreed (see e.g., testimony of Dr. Sawyer at Tr. 2164 ``.&blank;.&blank;. (T)rain the worker. I think
is the most important factor.'') There was substantial record support to expand training. Among those who advocated
additional OSHA training requirements were: P. Heffernan of Kaselaan and D'Angelo (Ex. 7&hyph;36), K. Churchill
of California Association of Asbestos Professionals (Ex. 7&hyph;95), D. Kirby of Oak Ridge National Lab (Ex. 77&hyph;111),
E. Krause of the United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers (Ex. 7&hyph;115), G. Lofton of Heat and Frost Insulators and
Asbestos Workers Union (Ex. 7&hyph;118), P. Curran of North Carolina State Department of Environment, Health, and
Natural Resources (Ex. 7&hyph;118), W. Dundulis of the State of Rhode Island Department of Health (Ex. 7&hyph;124),
BCTD (Ex. 119), American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (Ex. 141), Service Employees International
Unions, AFL-CIO (Ex. 144), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (Tr. 230). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants supported training all employees who handle asbestos, rather than waiting for significant exposures
to trigger it [see e.g., testimony of D. Kirby, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ``You need to have awareness training
of .&blank;.&blank;. custodial and maintenance'' people, (Tr 122); and, R. Lemen, NIOSH, who supported ``.&blank;.&blank;.
approved training courses for all workers who are routinely handling asbestos containing material, (Tr. 231)].''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second major expansion of training requirements covers curriculum method and length of training. Before, in
the 1986 standard, OSHA merely required that certain topics be covered in the training program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, as OSHA noted in its proposal, and participants noted in their comments, EPA's training requirements
under the Asbestos Hazard Response Act (AHERA) become the standard for the asbestos abatement industry. Under AHERA,
at the time of the proposal: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.&blank;.&blank;. Inspectors must take a 3-day training course; management planners must take the inspection course
plus an additional 2 days devoted to management planning; and abatement project designers are required to have at
least 3 days of training. In addition, asbestos abatement contractors and supervisors must take a 4-day training
course and asbestos abatement workers are required to take a 3-day training course. For all disciplines, persons
seeking accreditation must also pass an examination and participate in annual re-training courses. A complete description
of accreditation requirements can be found in the Model Accreditation Plan at 40 CFR part 763, subpart E, appendix
C.I.1.A. through E. (54 Fr, November 29, 1989 at 49190). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
More recently, EPA has published an interim rule updating its Model Accreditation Plan (MAP) (59 FR 5236&hyph;5260,
February 3, 1994) pursuant to the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA). Under the revisions,
the length of certain courses has increased, i.e. asbestos abatement workers now must take a 4-day, rather than a 3-day
course. Additionally, the entire MAP now applies to work in ``public and commercial buildings as well as in schools,''
and requires more ``hands-on'' training. For example, for abatement workers 14 hours of hands-on training must be
included in the 4-day training course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training provisions in the new standard correspond to the class of work performed. For Class I and II work, employers
must provide employees with a training course which is the equivalent in curriculum, training method and length to
the EPA MAP worker training described above. Keying OSHA required training to the AHERA program was supported by many
participants; in many sections of the country, most training is now done using AHERA accreditation as the standard
for quality, (see e.g., testimony of Daniel Swartzman, School of Public Health, Univ. of Ill, Tr. at 486. et seq.).
and because AHERA training as noted above, is the recognized standard for quality in asbestos work (see. must be trained
in the proposal, OSHA asked for comment on whether OSHA should provide model curricula and certification for training,
and on whether and how OSHA training requirements should be reconciled with those of EPA (55 FR 29726&hyph;28).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Much debate on these issues occurred in this rulemaking. Some, most prominently, BCTD, (Ex. 143 at 220 et seq, see also
Tr. 483; Tr. 1142, Tr. 3547) stated that OSHA should develop model curricula and certify training courses for asbestos
workers. Reasons for this were given as: OSHA's earlier training requirements are inadequate; that ``Ahera has proved
successful, but needs improvement,'' and that AHERA should be improved by more ``hands-on'' training and testing
and longer training (see Ex. 143 at 232). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency notes that participants agreeing and disagreeing with the need for OSHA certification of trainers and
courses agreed with BCTD's reasons. For example, R. Chadwick the President of Local Union 22 of the International
Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers, in a letter to OSHA stated that since OSHA stipulated
no specific minimum period of training, ``Most abatement contractors show a 2-hour film and classify the workers
being trained'' (Ex. 1&hyph;175). OSHA agreed with the above comment that its 1986 training requirements fairly
can be considered ``bare-bones.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although BCTD argued that the AHERA model needed improvement, BCTD acknowledged its success in improving worksite
conditions (see Ex. 143 at 240, citing Ex. 7&hyph;52). EPA itself has improved its training program. As noted above,
it recently issued improved model curricula, increasing the training requirements. In particular, the new MAP contains
specific ``hands-on'' training requirements in each major course, including those of workers and supervisors (59
FR 5236&hyph;60, February 3, 1994). EPA also increased the number of training hours and now requires 4-day training
of workers, and 5-day training of supervisors. Other disciplines of the AHERA program also have increased training
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has reviewed recommendations carefully and has concluded that requiring OSHA to certify training courses and
trainers would consume a disproportionate share of OSHA's resources. Further, establishing another system for
certifying asbestos trainers and workers when another agency has a similar program in place would be duplicative
of effort as well. OSHA's concerns regarding duplication of effort is also addressed in this preamble in the section
on the notification of OSHA vis-a-vis that of EPA under NESHAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, other entities have already developed more stringent curricula than those under AHERA. The HEI Report
noted that under AHERA each state develops ``training and certification programs for inspectors, management planner,
asbestos abatement workers and supervisors that were at least as stringent as the AHERA model'' (Ex. 1&hyph;344,
p. 5&hyph;51). It further found that a ``number of states have developed other requirements that exceeded the AHERA
requirement'' and that ``*&blank;*&blank;* in some states AHERA certification are required for any asbestos-related
work''_not just for schools. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (k)(8)(i)-(v) cover curricula and length of course requirement. They allow flexibility in the new training
provisions. Courses equivalent to those of AHERA (ASHARA) may be substituted, but must be equivalent in curriculum,
training method, and length to that of the EPA plan. Thus, employers who in-house training program meets these requirements
does not need send all workers off-site for the required training. Several commentaries objected to requiring that
all training take place in EPA or state approved training centers, most also praised job-specific training as superior
(e.g., Ex. 7&hyph;21, 7&hyph;39, 7&hyph;50, 7&hyph;99, 7&hyph;100, 7&hyph;102, 7&hyph;103, 7&hyph;108, 7&hyph;150).

Training Requirements for Employees Performing Class III and IV Work: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In these standards OSHA does not define the term ``custodian'' nor do the requirements differ based on the job title.
OSHA agrees that in some facilities there is a clear distinction between custodial workers who as a participant noted,
``may only *&blank;*&blank;* strip or buff floor tile or replace light bulbs in fixtures located below ACM'' and maintenance
workers ``who *&blank;*&blank;* work on building materials or systems that contain asbestos''. (ICSC, Ex. 162&hyph;58
at 10). Relying on job title, however, to assign duties is inexact and potentially non-protective. Rather in these
standards, the nature of the operations performed by that worker determine the level of training required, regardless
of job title; janitor, custodian, or maintenance worker. Those who perform only Class IV work must receive at least
2 hours of awareness training, and those who do Class III work must be given 16 hours of training equivalent in content
and length to the 16 hour operations and maintenance course developed by EPA (see 40 CFR 763.92(a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workers performing these activities may be employees of the building owners or other employers such as outside housekeeping
contractors, or trade contractors such as plumbing, electrical, or air conditioning contractors. They must be trained
to use appropriate measures to avoid exposure to airborne asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA in the November 3, 1992 notice, stated that it was considering a training requirement modelled after that of the
awareness training required by EPA in its AHERA rule. OSHA further noted that in its training requirements under AHERA,
EPA distinguishes between the duties and training of custodial workers and the additional duties and training needs
of maintenance and service workers (40 CFR Parts 763). OSHA, too, believes that building/facility workers, who frequently
disturb asbestos containing material need more extensive training.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many who commented during the supplemental comment period agreed that OSHA should use AHERA as a general model for
drafting training requirements for building/facility workers (e.g., Ex. 162&hyph;13, 162&hyph;15, 162&hyph;16,
162&hyph;18, 162&hyph;24, 162&hyph;27, 162&hyph;30, 162&hyph;35, 162&hyph;42, 162&hyph;44, 162&hyph;45,162&hyph;46).
Others, felt the existing OSHA training requirements were adequate (e.g., Ex. 162&hyph;4, 162&hyph;22). Some objected
to OSHA specifying a time period in its training requirements (Ex. 162&hyph;4, 162&hyph;12, 162&hyph;17, 162&hyph;25,
162&hyph;50, 162&hyph;55, 162&hyph;57). BCTD argued that AHERA training was inadequate for OSHA's purposes, and
that any employee in a building containing either ACM or PACM who does not intentionally handle the material should
receive at least 4 hours of awareness training and that any worker who disturbs ACM during repair, renovation, demolition
or maintenance work needs the full 5-day training course (Ex. 162&hyph;42). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the training provisions of AHERA, all members of the maintenance and custodial staffs (of schools) who may work
in a building containing ACBM are required to receive at least 2 hours of ``awareness'' training whether or not they
are required to work with it (40 CFR 763.92). Those who conduct an activity which will result in disturbance of ACBM
shall receive both the awareness training and 14 additional hours of training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA set as a minimum that the awareness training cover:

Information in this rulemaking discussed above shows that workers who have performed work now designated Class III
and IV have developed asbestos-related disease. Because as noted above, training is one of the most powerful instruments
to protect workers, OSHA believes that its former training provisions must be improved by incorporating additional
curricula such as covered in the AHERA courses for such workers. Imposing time criteria for courses will help insure
that sufficient time for instruction is provided. More time can always be allotted, as needed.

Paragraph (k) General Industry Standard. Paragraph (l) Construction and Shipyard Employment Standards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Housekeeping practices have been shown to be effective means of reducing employee exposure to asbestos. OSHA is specifying
that the now required cleaning of floors and surfaces on which dust containing asbestos can accumulate be performed
at least once per shift in primary and secondary manufacturing. In addition to the current requirement that a vacuum
containing a HEPA-filter must be used, where feasible, wet methods must also be used for clean-up. Once asbestos dust
is entrained, it can accumulate on surfaces leading to potentially substantial levels of exposure. Routine removal
of dust can greatly reduce these accumulations and the risks that they pose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was little over-all objection to this provision from the participants in the rulemaking process. However,
the Asbestos Information Association asked that OSHA not revise the current housekeeping requirements which specify
that all surfaces be maintained as free as practicable of accumulation of dusts and wastes containing asbestos (Ex.
142, p. 7). They argue that if OSHA requires once per shift vacuuming, it would lead to less effective housekeeping
efforts since vacuuming might then occur at a later time in the areas most in need of housekeeping than occurs with current
cleanup whenever a fiber accumulation occurs.'' OSHA is unconvinced by this argument. If the employer believes that
more frequent cleanup is needed, it should be performed. The standard merely requires that vacuuming be done no less
often than once per shift. The employer can determine when during a shift, vacuuming is most useful and perform it then.

There are now a new &sect;&sect;1926.1101 (g)(2)(iv) and 1910.1001(f)(1)(xi), which prohibit the sanding of floor
tiles containing asbestos. Further, only low abrasion pads may be used at speeds lower than 300 rpm in ``stripping''
operations, and stripping of unwaxed or unfinished floor tile containing asbestos is prohibited. OSHA believes
that without such restrictions this type of mechanized activity may result in the release of significant levels of
asbestos fibers into the air. In addition, the new provisions allow asbestos-containing floors to be mechanically
buffed without limitation on the speed of the buffing machine, so long as the floor has sufficient finish to preclude
contact between the pad and the asbestos-containing material. In most cases, at least 3 layers of wax will provide
that margin. If the manufacturer's instructions specify a thicker wax layer, those instructions must be followed.
(See testimony of J. Harless of Pioneer Eclipse, ISSA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These requirements are changed in some respects from the July, 1990 proposal, which would have further restricted
stripping and burnishing activities. The prohibition concerning ``sanding'' of asbestos-containing floors was
supported by ISSA and others, and it unchanged from the proposal. (See Ex. 136D). The changes from the proposal reflect
the comments and data submitted to the record. The data show that now permitted activities are not expected to result
in the release of significant asbestos contamination. In addition, since OSHA's proposal had used various terms
relating to floor care imprecisely, the final provisions conform the language to the common understandings of the
floor care industry. Thus, ``stripping'' is defined as a wet process to remove the floor polish or finish using chemical
strippers, or abrasive pads. (See Ex. 136D, ISSA's comments). ``Burnishing'' is dry buffing of floor polish by a high-speed
rotary disc machine or otherwise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The core requirements of OSHA's new provisions are that no ``sanding'', i.e. the abrading of asbestos-containing
material to even out the surface, is allowed: that ``stripping'' of finishes of asbestos-containing flooring must
be conducted wet using the least abrasive pad possible; and that burnishing may be performed only on floors which have
sufficient finish so that the pad does not contact the unfinished asbestos-containing material. OSHA believes that
these three principles of asbestos-containing floor maintenance are sufficiently clear and flexible to apply to
all kinds of floor maintenance activities, even if the activity is described using different terminology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is basing these provisions primarily on the results of studies submitted during the rulemaking. Thus, in the
most thorough and detailed study submitted to date on this topic, BCTD furnished a copy of a study by T. Marxhausen and
S. Shaffer entitled ``Vinyl Asbestos Tile: A study of airborne asbestos concentrations during routine floor maintenance
activities.'' (Ex. 119X) In this study both TEM and PCM measurements were made during several operations. The results
are briefly summarized in Table VIII.

The authors found that approximately 97% of the asbestos structures observed during all analyses were less than 5
microns in length (and would therefore not be seen by PCM). They concluded that ``Concentrations were low during low
speed scrubs and burnishing of freshly built-up, new floor finishes. High speed scrub results were highest on the
worn floor but dropped to approximately one-fifth this level on freshly built-up surfaces.'' The authors noted that
although high speed scrubs and burnishing operations used the same machine and pad, the fiber levels observed in high
speed scrub operations were higher than during burnishing. They hypothesized that this had been due to condition
of the floor tested or that ``the limited amount of cleaning solution causes the higher values observed during high
speed scrubbing operations.'' They expressed serious concern about the elevated TEM measurements during some of
these operations and called for more extensive study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
S. Wong, Director of Environmental Health and Safety Branch of the Los Angeles Unified School District submitted
a report of a study in which fiber levels were measured by TEM during various floor maintenance activities (Ex. 7&hyph;11).
Using a pass-fail criterion of 5 samples less than or equal to 70 structures per square millimeter (the AHERA clearance
level), she found that 5 of 7 stripping pads failed. She also found that use of a brush with a rotary powered scrubbing
machine passed and that various stripping solution used in conjunction with the brush also passed. Repeated use of
a pad which initially passed, continued to do so. In a final test using one of the stripping solutions and 7 other brushes,
all failed. However, neither the OSHA PEL nor action level was exceeded. The report concluded with several recommendations:
(1) all VAT floor maintenance using powered equipment be performed using wet methods exclusively; (2) that use of
aggressive pads results in release of fibers from previously applied wax (They found 5% fibers in the old wax scraped
from baseboards.) and their use should be discontinued; (3) schools continue to use only the off-white or pink pad
which passed for buffing; (4) recommends discontinuance of use of power equipment to strip wax from floors unless
they do not contain asbestos; and, (5) alter maintenance program to perform frequent damp mopping and less frequent
stripping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both studies cited above were conducted after the A.F. Meyer study discussed in the proposal, which was conducted
in October 1989, and which showed slightly elevated asbestos levels after routine buffing (with standard red buffing
pad and standard buffing solution) and stripping. No levels, however, exceeded OSHA's proposed PELs. Two methods
were used for stripping: (1) standard stripping mixture mopped on and standard black stripping pad, and (2) mist spray
of stripper solution and standard black stripping pad. As noted in the proposal, the stripping conducted using a mist
spray of stripping solution and the more abrasive pad resulted in significantly higher asbestos fiber airborne concentrations
than the first method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 25, 1990, in response to the A.F. Meyer study, EPA published a ``Recommended Interim Guidance for Maintenance
of Asbestos-Containing Floor Coverings,'' (Ex. 1&hyph;108) outlining its analysis of the Meyer's findings. The
Agency concluded that, although there was ``no clear evidence'' that ``routine'' stripping significantly elevated
levels of asbestos fibers, it observed that higher levels did occur after a stripping machine was used on a relatively
dry, unwaxed floor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Work practices recommended by EPA in the same guidance memo emphasize the same precautions contained in OSHA's final
standards: viz. that the least abrasive pad be used for stripping, and that low speed equipment be used for stripping
of floors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that ACCSH's recommendations for work practices in floor maintenance also echo the themes of wet stripping,
using the least abrasive pad for stripping, limiting the speed of the machine and prohibiting floor sanding, which
are the core requirements in this standard. (Ex. 1&hyph;126). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a change from the proposal, OSHA is permitting high speed buffing of finished floors containing asbestos material.
A number of participants pointed out to OSHA that buffing, although performed at high speed, is done on 3 to 5 layers
of wax, unlike sanding, and that the wax, not the tile, is polished in this process. (Ex. 7&hyph;19, 7&hyph;80, 7&hyph;84,
7&hyph;90, 7&hyph;100, 7&hyph;107, 7&hyph;123, 7&hyph;142, 7&hyph;188, 125D, 147 and Tr. at 3599). Michael B.
Wheeler Chief Executive Officer of Essential Industries Inc., stated that:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Stripping is expensive, labor and material-intensive, and, in the context of vinyl asbestos tile something we wish
to keep to a minimum. Ultra high speed maintenance techniques allow workers in heavy trafficked stores to strip their
finished floors every 10&hyph;18 months as compared to every 2&hyph;3 months using older low speed techniques. (Ex.
7&hyph;188).

He went on to explain that these high speed techniques also reduce the labor requirements by at least half. He cited
studies using low speed spray buffing techniques on finished VAT which yielded fiber levels ranging from 0.015 to
0.025 f/cc and quoted the WRC-TV report that ``just buffing an already waxed floor does not throw up any asbestos from
the asbestos tile.'' In addition, ISSA described additional floor maintenance procedures which increase the glossiness
of the floor_spray buffing (done at 175&hyph;300 rpm) and burnishing (done at 300&hyph;2,000 rpm). ISSA stated that
if there is finish on the floor surface, these procedures do not generate unsafe levels of fibers because they do not
contact the floor itself. They oppose OSHA's proposed changes prohibiting speeds of more than 190 rpm in floor machines,
particularly due to increased costs in time and money. (Ex. 136D).

Based on this record, OSHA believes that employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who burnish and/or buff floors using high speed floor machines will be exposed to minimal asbestos fiber concentrations
if the floor machines are used to polish finished or polished floors, and if the pad does not contact the unpolished
floor. Industry also claims that the use of high speed buffing will increase the intervals where stripping is required,
and thus, may reduce risk to employees who perform floor maintenance, but OSHA is not relying on this speculative benefit.

(15) Competent Person
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Paragraph (o) Construction and Shipyard Employment Standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is adopting as final provisions most of the proposed changes to the 1986 construction standard's requirements
concerning the designation of a ``competent person'' on certain construction worksites. The term ``competent person''
is derived from the generic construction standard's provisions. Under these, employers must designate a ``competent
person'' on all construction worksites to conduct ``frequent and regular inspections of the job sites, materials,
and equipment'' as part of required safety and health programs (&sect;1926.20). At the suggestion of SESAC, OSHA
has designated that the person who performs the shipyard duties analogous to the competent person in the construction
standard will be termed a ``qualified person.'' For the purposes of the present discussion these terms are equivalent
and will be discussed as ``competent person.'' The 1986 asbestos construction standard appeared to limit this requirement.
``Competent person'' supervision was required only at removal, demolition, and renovation operations which were
not ``small-scale, short-duration,'' but under the asbestos standard, the competent person was to be specially
trained in asbestos hazards, and perform various duties mainly involving the setting up and control of the NPE, and
the supervision of workers within the enclosure (formerly 1926.58(e)(6)(ii)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court of Appeals, agreeing with BCTD, instructed OSHA to either expand the ``competent person'' requirement
or explain more persuasively why it refused to do so. OSHA agrees that for all construction work involving asbestos
exposure under this standard, a ``competent person'' who is specially trained in asbestos related work conditions,
should either be available to employees or be present on the work site. Like other provisions in this standard, the
more risky asbestos work deserves a more protective provision; so employees performing Class I and II work will have
the benefit of a ``competent person'' on the worksite, to the extent necessary to perform his duties as set out in paragraph
(o). Employees performing Class III and IV work, will be entitled to access to a ``competent person'' as needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two issues regarding the ``competent person'' were discussed during the rulemaking. One was the training required;
and two, whether or not the competent person needs to be present throughout the operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As to the second issue, the standard requires in paragraph (o) (2) and (3), that the competent person must perform the
``frequent and regular inspections of the job sites, material and equipment'' to accomplish ``health and safety
programs,'' which are otherwise required by the general construction provision in &sect;1926.20(b)(2). Although
no elaboration of this provision is provided, OSHA intends that in all work covered by this standard, including Class
IV work and work not included in a ``Class,'' a competent person insures, by inspecting the worksite, that workers
exposed to asbestos are protected by the relevant provisions of this standard, and that they are informed pursuant
to paragraph (k) of this standard about the presence and location of ACM and PACM. Additionally, paragraph (o)(3)
requires that in Class I operations the ``competent person'' must make on-site inspections at least once during the
workshift and any time at employee request. In addition, the list of specific duties of the ``competent person'' in
paragraph (o)(3)(i) for Class I and II work includes specific language requiring the required supervision of various
controls and work practices to be made through ``on-site inspection.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The record supports the need for on-site supervision of setting up of controls. Chip D'Angelo, when asked what were
his major concern about glove bags, testified that ``Just the act of attaching *&blank;*&blank;* concerns us *&blank;*&blank;*
a lot of times the material is so overly dry and very loose *&blank;*&blank;* simply attaching the bag can create some
problems *&blank;*&blank;* Removing the bag, if not done properly and evacuated properly and twisted properly,
actually expels fibers out into the air'' (Tr. 3126). For example, he/she must be present when a glove bag is attached
and determine that a smoke test is passed and again be present when the bag is removed. It is not necessary that the competent
person continually watch the operation, rather that he oversees its proper completion. OSHA has not specified the
ratio of on-site supervisors to abatement workers. Mr. Booher of Exxon Company, testified that ``if you have three
glove bag operations going on next to one another, in close proximity to one another, that one competent person can
handle up to three jobs effectively'' (Tr. 2677). The Agency believes that various operations need closer supervision
than others; the exposure assessment should clarify how close supervision needs to be. So long as the specific activities
in the standard requiring inspection are covered, the extent of the required inspections are up to the judgment of
the ``competent person.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training for the competent person is the same for those who supervise Class I and II asbestos work under the standard.
The training must be obtained in a course which is the equivalent of the EPA supervisor course. Unlike the training
requirements for workers for Class II jobs which may concentrate on a particular kind of material if that is the only
asbestos work which an employee does, the ``competent person'' supervising Class II jobs must be trained comprehensively
in all aspects of asbestos related construction work. Thus, for example, a flooring removal supervisor must be informed
about all asbestos removal control methods: this is the person who must evaluate a prospective job to assure that the
PELs will not be exceeded, who must choose among available controls to reduce exposures, and must know how to supervise
extensive control systems if they are needed for high exposure Class II work. The training requirements of persons
supervising Class III work are different. Most Class III work is maintaining or renovating building components.
Supervisors of such work need not be trained in methods of abating asbestos material on a large scale. The EPA asbestos
in schools rules, now updated to encompass commercial and public buildings requires that maintenance workers in
asbestos-containing buildings be trained in a 16-hour course which includes; proper asbestos-related work practices,
waste handling and disposal, respirator use, decontamination procedures, and the content of applicable Federal,
state and local asbestos regulations. All Class III workers and their supervisors must take such a course, which covers
all control measures required for Class III work. In this regard OSHA notes comments which stated that training supervisors
of plumbers, pipefitters, and sheet metal workers, who are engaged in projects of incidental removal that are small
scale and short term, in full enclosure techniques is wasteful (see e.g. Ex. 7&hyph;151, 152, 153). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the formal training for supervisors and workers in Class III work is the same, additional criteria for ``competency''
contained in the general construction standard distinguish worker and supervisor on all asbestos jobs, including
Class III. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the ``competent person'' must be ``capable of identifying existing and predictable hazards *&blank;*&blank;*
which are *&blank;*&blank;* hazardous to employees, and (have) authorization to take prompt corrective measures
to eliminate them'' (29 CFR 1926.32(f)). Also, the ``competent person'' must be designated by the employer (29 CFR
1926.20(b)(2)). OSHA notes that the ``competency'' of the competent person is independent of the training required.
``Competency'' as well as training is required. Thus, a ``competent person'' is not merely someone with a specified
level of training but connotes a high level of knowledge of worksite safety and health issues as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for a high degree of expertise for Class III work was acknowledged by labor representatives. (See ACCSH reference
in the proposal at 55 FR 29727, and R. Gobbell's testimony (Tr. 4318). Employer representatives questioned the need
for this uniform training requirements for competent persons supervising all asbestos work, but also acknowledged
that supervisors of maintenance projects needed training in the control methods required (See e.g.Ex. 7&hyph;151,
7&hyph;152, 153); others stated that in-house training was often superior to EPA's (see e.g. Amoco Corporation,
Ex. 7&hyph;37); and that trained competent persons should be allowed to train other workers (Gulf Power Company,
Ex. 7&hyph;50). OSHA is allowing in-house training so long as it meets the criteria for curriculum, length, and method
of training contained in the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training for ``competent persons'' for Class IV work depends on when that work is performed. When Class IV workers
perform their duties in facilities and buildings where no other asbestos work is taking place, the ``competent person''
supervising them must be trained in an EPA accredited course on operations and maintenance workers or its equivalent,
much as for Class III work. If clean-up work is done within a regulated area, supervision of the clean-up must be conducted
by the ``competent person'' who is supervising the asbestos job for which the area was established, which in most cases
will be Class I and II work.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
A number of participants in the rulemaking, primarily representing industry interests, objected to the proposed
requirement for a competent person specifically trained in an EPA-approved course to oversee workers performing
small-scale, short duration asbestos jobs. These included: J. Bavan of Michigan Consumers Power (Ex 7&hyph;21),
Mr. Quanstrom of Amoco Corporation who felt in-house training was often superior to EPA's (Ex. 7&hyph;37), and others
contain virtually identical comments in which the plumbing contractors state their support.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the record evidence, OSHA concludes that its expansion of the competent person requirements and additional
requirements for training are appropriate.

SESAC agreed that asbestos operations should be overseen by personnel who have the qualifications to ensure that
asbestos operations are performed safely; however, they noted in their submission (Ex. 7&hyph;77) that in existing
OSHA shipyard standards, the term competent person(s) has been used to refer to a person who is uniquely qualified
to perform entry tests preparatory to entering enclosed and confined spaces and felt that the use of this term as employed
in the asbestos standard would cause confusion. They suggested that the competent person be called a ``qualified''
person in the shipyard standard. OSHA does not object to this substitution of terms, but notes that all requirements
for competent/qualified person(s) are to be equivalent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SESAC also pointed to a process which may be the general case in large operations, in which the duties of the shipyard
qualified person are shared or divided between two or more persons. That is, in some of the larger companies represented
on the committee, a training department (not a person) is responsible for ensuring that employees are trained and
another department is responsible for setting up the regulated area, while an industrial hygiene department conducts
all monitoring. SESAC recommended that this be specifically allowed. OSHA feels that the current regulatory language
permits utilizing this organization of responsibilities and agrees with the suggestion that it is appropriate for
shipyards.

Shipyard Employment Standard. With respect to the appendices to the standard, SESAC recommended inclusion of the
appendix dealing with work practices and engineering controls for automotive brake and clutch repair and assembly
in the shipyard standard. OSHA agrees that this appendix is appropriate to the shipyard employment standard, since
these activities occur within shipyards and has included this as appendix L in the shipyard employment standard.
OSHA further notes that this appendix has been amended subsequent to consideration by SESAC, and therefore differs
from the alternate regulatory language suggested by the committee. For example, the Agency no longer considers the
solvent spray can a preferred method for controlling asbestos contamination and will not include it in either standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change is made to assure that the analytical methodologies followed are the most current and reliable available.
Appendix B of this standard has been updated and is the most current version of OSHA ID&hyph;160. This method was written
to adhere to the language of Appendix A so that there would be no confusion about the limits of the sampling and analytical
parameters such as flow rates. So long as parameters consistent with Appendix A are used, there will be no analytical
differences between ID&hyph;160 and NIOSH 7400 methods.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The practice of reusing cassettes can result in lower estimates of employee exposure. Adequate cleaning of the cassettes
cannot be assured. Fibers from the cassette may become dislodged and be collected on the filter during subsequent
sampling. Employee exposure assessments are often assessed based on a small number of fibers. This is because it is
not possible in every work place to use single cassettes for an entire work shift due to excess dust in the air. This is
significant for occupational exposures, because the background fiber concentration must be subtracted from the
compliance sample. If fugitive fibers from used cassettes were deposited on the blank filter, the background estimate
would be artificially high and the employee exposure will be underestimated when the background concentration is
subtracted as required. Elimination of the practice of reusing cassettes will eliminate this source of error, thereby
better assessing employee exposure. A requirement that cassette reuse not be allowed is added to the end of paragraph
2 of Appendix A.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Each set of samples taken will include 10% field blanks or a minimum of 2 field blanks. These blanks must come from
the same lot as the filters used for sample collection. The field blank results shall be averaged and subtracted from
the analytical results before reporting. A set consists of any sample or group of samples for which an evaluation for
this standard must be made. Any samples represented by a field blank having a fiber count in excess of the detection
limit of the method being used shall be rejected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The original wording of the standard was inadequate to apply meaningfully to certain sampling practices, such as
continuous sampling. This change establishes that the blanks are to be field blanks. This wording also establishes
when blanks are to be taken. The specific practice to be followed for blank correction is outlined in Appendix B, the
detailed analytical method. Each time an evaluation of work place exposure is made for the purposes of this standard,
the samples used in that evaluation must be represented by valid blanks taken in the work space where the compliance
samples were taken.

The following changes apply to the Quality Control Section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 2 is renumbered 2(a). Since the standard was promulgated, the lack of a specific requirement to participate
the Program for Analytical Testing (PAT) has led to confusion with the requirement that laboratories participate
in a round robin using samples taken from real world samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a requirement of OSHA method ID&hyph;160 and NIOSH 7400. This requirement was originally left out of the standard
because of the uncertain status of the PAT program at the time of promulgation of the standard. Inclusion at this time
is to make it clear that the required participation in a round robin indicated in paragraph 2(a) is not satisfied by
participation in the PAT program. Such participation is however, highly desirable and may be required for private
accreditation.

Since the original promulgation of the asbestos standards, there have been several improvements and refinements
to the analytical procedure. Two major analytical methods reflect these changes and continue to be updated as necessary.
The changes are mostly procedural, providing safer analysis and clearer descriptions of the procedures that are
to be carried out. As a result, Appendix A and Appendix B have been updated to reflect the most recent refinements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes to the mandatory asbestos method Appendix A are intended to clarify some of the requirements of the method.
Wording has been inserted to indicate what methods are acceptable. A definition of what constitutes a ``set'' of asbestos
samples was added to more clearly define when blank samples are to be taken and to reinforce that they are to be field
samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 11 is amended to clarify what a set of samples is and when it is necessary to take blank samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An early draft version of NIOSH method 7400 was used for the model of Appendix B. There were several problems with the
method including the potentially dangerous practice of boiling acetone. This appendix has been replaced entirely
with the most current version of OSHA method ID&hyph;160 Asbestos in Air. The OSHA ID&hyph;160 give the same results
as NIOSH 7400 when used within the sampling constraints imposed by Appendix A, notably the flow rate limits of between
0.5 and 5 liters per minute for the 25 mm cassette and 1 to 5 for the 37 mm cassette. The counting rules are functionally
the same for both methods. Use of Appendix B, OSHA ID&hyph;160 or NIOSH method 7400 when used within the constraints
of Appendix A are all acceptable and equivalent. Appendix B is the same as OSHA method ID&hyph;160 on the date of publication
of these changes. It, like NIOSH method 7400, is subject to change when such changes will result in better methodology.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the PEL has been lowered to 0.1 fiber/cc, there is an increased concern about sample overloading as voiced by several
commentors such as the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA). Such overloading is the presence of non-asbestos
dust on the surface of the filter obscuring the filter surface. Such dust has been shown to decrease the number of fibers
counted even before the surface is fully obscured. Some employers have taken samples in such a way that there are no
representative samples for the work being performed because all of the filters have been obscured by excess dust.
The intention of Appendix A is to provide for the most precise measurement possible while allowing for the fact that
many work places have an exceeding amount of non-asbestos dust. Appendix A suggests that a sample be collected such
that there are a minimum of 100 fibers/mm2. In many work places this is not possible. It is preferable to collect a sample
that can be used to estimate the asbestos concentration even if it is with a higher than ideal error level than it is to
collect a large volume and completely obscure the filter rendering the sample useless. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An acceptable weight of dust on the filter is highly dependent on the average particle size of the dust. Very small particles
such as those from diesel exhaust will quickly obscure the filter with very little weight (much less than 1 mg on the
filter). On the other hand, large particles may load the weight up beyond several milligrams with little loss in fiber
count. For 5 micrometer diameter particles with a density of 3, 25% of the filter area will be obscured with a total weight
on the filter of 1mg. Increasing the average diameter of the particles to 10 micrometers will double the allowable
weight to 2mg. It is very important for the person conducting sampling to be careful about the dust levels in the air.
It is acceptable to take a series of samples to model the work place air when serial sampling will result in samples that
can be used. Serial sampling has the additional benefit that higher asbestos concentrations can be measured by reducing
the volume of air drawn through each filter.

OSHA is removing appendix G from the construction standard. The rulemaking proceeding and the Agency's experience
enforcing the unrevised standard showed that this ``non-mandatory'' appendix was unclear and that portions of it
belonged in the regulatory text. Former appendix G covered controls for all four classes of asbestos work. Therefore,
OSHA has extracted the main provisions covering various controls and practices required for each class and placed
them as discussed in the regulatory text applying to each operation covered.

OSHA method ID&hyph;191 for bulk asbestos analysis has been included as Appendix J, to provide a suggested uniform
method for the identification of asbestos. This method uses polarized light optics on a phase contrast microscope.
Using this methodology, fibers visible in phase contrast illumination can be viewed to assess whether there might
be potential for asbestos exposure from a material which can be measured by a phase contrast counting method. This
method also contains the criteria used by OSHA to differentiate between asbestiform and non-habit of minerals. The
text of the method is informational and explains its limitations and proper use.

Environmental Assessment; Findings of No Significant Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has reviewed the environmental impact in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations (40 CFR Part
1500), and OSHA's NEPA compliance procedures (29 CFR Part 11). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of this review, OSHA has determined that these regulations will have no impact on air, water or soil quality,
plant or animal life, or the use of land or aspects of the external environment. Therefore, OSHA concludes there will
be no significant impact on the general quality of the human environment outside the workplace, particularly in terms
of ambient air quality, water quality, or solid waste disposal. No comments made at the public hearing or submitted
to the record contradict this conclusion.

State Plan Requirements

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 25 States and territories with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans must revise their
existing standards within six months of the publication date of the final standards or show OSHA why there is no need
for action, e.g., because existing state standards are already ``at least as effective'' as the new Federal standards.
These States are: California, Connecticut (State and local government workers only), Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,
Maryland, Michigan Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York (State and local government workers only), North Carolina,
Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington and Wyoming. Until such time as a State standard
is promulgated, Federal OSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standard has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987) regarding
Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting State policy options,
consult with States prior to taking any actions that would restrict State policy options, and take such actions only
when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides for
preemption of State law only if there is a clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national
scope. Additionally, the Order provides for preemption of State law only if there is a clear Congressional intent
for the agency to do so. Any such preemption is to be limited to the extent possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt State
laws relating to issues with respect to which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety or health standards.
Under the OSH Act a State can avoid preemption only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development
of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Plan-States
must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment
as the Federal standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federally promulgated Asbestos standard is drafted so that workers in every State would be protected by general,
performance-oriented standards. To the extent that there are State or regional peculiarities that could alter work
practices, States with occupational safety and health plans approved under section 18 of the OSH Act would be able
to develop their own State standards to deal with any special problems. Moreover, the performance nature of this final
standard, of and by itself, allows for flexibility by States and contractors to provide as much safety as possible
using varying methods consonant with conditions in each State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, there is a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health of workers. While the individual
States, if all acted, might be able collectively to deal with the safety problems involved; most have not elected to
do so in the twenty-three years since the enactment if the OSH Act. Those States which have elected to participate under
section 18 of the OSHA Act would not be preempted by this final regulation and would be able to deal with special, local
conditions within the framework provided by this performance-oriented standard while ensuring that their standards
are at least as effective as the Federal standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this final revision to the asbestos standard for construction, general industry and shipyards, OSHA is lowering
the permissible exposure limit in all affected industry sectors to 0.1 f/cc as an 8-hour time-weighted average. In
addition, OSHA is revising ancillary requirements in the current standard to respond to three issues remanded to
the Agency by the Court. These issues involved expanded competent person training, clarification of the definition
for small-scale, short-duration construction projects, and reporting and transfer requirements in construction.
Also, permissible controls in brake and clutch operations are addressed in a revision to the standard for general
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be prepared for any regulation that meets the criteria
for a ``significant regulatory action.'' Among these criteria, relevant to this rulemaking is the requirement that
the rule have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with these requirements, OSHA has made a determination that the final revised standard will constitute
a significant regulatory action. Accordingly, OSHA has prepared this Final Regulatory Impact and Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis to demonstrate the technological and economic feasibility of the final revision.

Characteristics and Properties of Asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos is the generic term applied to a group of naturally-occurring, fibrous silicates characterized by high
tensile strength,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 flexibility, and resistance to thermal, chemical, and electrical conditions. According to the Bureau of Mines,
a number of silicates occur naturally in fibrous form, however, not all of these mineral forms are labeled asbestos.
Historically, only minerals with (1) commercial importance (2) a crystalline structure with fiber growth along
two planes (i.e., lengthwise) and (3) sufficient fiber growth such that the fibers can be identified, separated,
and processed, are given the name asbestos [Campbell, 1977].

Tensile strength is defined as the resistance of a material to a force tending to tear it apart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos silicates are divided into two mineral groups: serpentine and amphiboles. Both groups are widely distributed
in the earth's crust in many igneous and metamorphic rocks. In rare instances, these mineral deposits contain sufficient
quantities of usable asbestiform minerals rendering it profitable to mine for commercial asbestos. Some types of
commercial asbestos have the properties of softness, silkiness and flexibility that, among other uses, permits
them to be spun into thread from which cloth can be woven. This variety, found in the serpentine group and given the name
chrysotile, is by far the most abundant of the asbestos minerals, comprising over 90 percent of world production.
Five other commercial varieties_riebeckite (crocidolite), grunerite (amosite), anthophyllite, tremolite,
and actinolite_belong to the amphibole group and, unlike the serpentines, are characterized by hard and brittle
fibers. Chrysotile, amosite, and crocidolite all have extremely high tensile strengths and have been used extensively
as reinforcers in cements, resins, and plastics.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos Production, Consumption, and Use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the production process, asbestos ore is mined and then milled to achieve a homogeneous, graded input. Raw asbestos
is shipped to primary industries to be processed into intermediate or finished products. For some goods, secondary
manufacturing may be necessary to complete the production process. The finished product is then sold to construction/consumer
industries for application, installation or erection without further modification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Domestically used asbestos fibers are technically classified into seven quality categories, or grades, with the
longer, higher-strength fibers given lower-numbered grade levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1 presents the 1992 distribution of asbestos consumption in the United States, by end use, type and grade. Historically,
Grades 1, 2 and 3 were used for relatively refined uses such as textiles, electrical insulation, and pharmaceutical
and beverage filters. With the introduction of ceramic fibers, fibrous glass, cellulose fibers and other substitutes,
use of asbestos in these and other products has declined in recent years. As Table 1 shows, U.S. consumption of chrysotile
asbestos is concentrated in Grade 7, whose shorter, lower-strength fibers are used as reinforcers in coatings and
compounds, clutch facings and brake linings (friction products), packing and gaskets, and roofing products.

 a year earlier. Of the 32.8 thousand metric tons used in final products in 1992, 31.6 thousand metric tons were imported,
at a value of $7.2 million dollars (not shown in table). World production in 1992 was an estimated 3.1 million metric
tons [Bureau of Mines, 1993, Table 1].

According to the Bureau of Mines, 1991 apparent consumption of asbestos in the United States was 34,765 metric tons
[Bureau of Mines, 1993, Table 1]. Total consumption shown in Table 1, taken from another Bureau of Mines table, differs
from the first estimate by roughly 800 metric tons. The difference may be partly accounted for by the exclusion of the
``Other'' category from the 1991 total in Table 1.

In July 1989, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a final rule under section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control
Act to prohibit the future manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution of asbestos in almost all products.
The Asbestos Ban and Phaseout Rule (40 CFR 763.160) was scheduled to eliminate asbestos in most commercial products
in three stages over seven years beginning in 1990 and ending in 1996. EPA's asbestos rule was challenged in U.S. court
by the asbestos industry. In October 1991, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded most of the
ban and phaseout rule to EPA. As a result of the Court decision, most asbestos products are no longer subject to the ban
and phaseout rule. The Court chose to let stand EPA's authority to ban products that no longer are being produced in
or imported into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumption of asbestos products in the United States has declined in recent years due to technological, regulatory
and economic factors. U.S. manufacturers have modified product design to either (1) accommodate the use of asbestos
substitutes or (2) eliminate the need for fibrous materials altogether. Examples of asbestos substitutes include
aramid fiber, carbon fiber, cellulose fiber, ceramic fiber, fibrous glass, organic fiber, steel fibers, and wollastonite.
The following products have been successfully introduced as alternatives to asbestos: aluminum, vinyl and wood
siding; aluminum and fiberglass sheet; asphalt coatings; ductile iron pipe; polyvinylchloride pipe; prestressed
and reinforced concrete pipe; and semimetallic brakes. Although the introduction of asbestos substitutes and alternatives
enables manufacturers to avoid contact with asbestos, many of these surrogates pose occupational health hazards
of varying degrees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the decline in U.S. consumption of asbestos, foreign markets continue to demand U.S. asbestos products.
The export and re-export of asbestos fibers and asbestos products from the United States was valued at $140.8 million
in 1992, an increase of 14 percent from the 1991 level. Leading importers of American asbestos materials were Canada,
Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Germany. At the same time, three members of the European Community_Germany,
the Netherlands, and Italy_are taking legislative steps to ban the use of asbestos. Effective dates for the ban initiatives
ranged from July 1993 to 1995. In addition, Finland and Poland are phasing out the importation and use of asbestos [Canadian
Mineral Yearbook, 1993, p. 10.4].

Asbestos Exposure in General Industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has determined that the following general industry groups will be affected by the revision to the asbestos standard:
primary manufacture of asbestos friction materials (SIC 3292); primary manufacture of asbestos gaskets and packings
(SIC 3053); primary manufacture of asbestos adhesives, sealants, and coatings (SIC 2952); primary manufacture
of asbestos-reinforced plastics (SIC 3089); general automotive repair (SICs 551, 554 and 753) and shipbuilding
and repair (SIC 3731). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, secondary gaskets and packings and secondary auto remanufacturing fall under the scope of the revised
standard. However, few impacts, if any, are anticipated for these industry groups due to their low current exposure
levels (below the revised PEL of 0.1 f/cc).

Primary Manufacturing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Primary manufacturers use asbestos fiber as a raw material in the production of an intermediate product to be further
processed or fabricated into a finished product. As shown in Table 2, two processes_fiber introduction and product
finishing/dry mechanical_are common to all primary manufacturing operations and, according to risk profiles in
earlier reports [RTI, 1985; ICF, 1988], have a high potential for generating airborne asbestos fiber.

Friction materials.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Asbestos friction products include brake linings (i.e. linings for drum brakes, disc pads for disc brakes, and brake
blocks), clutch facings, and industrial linings for equipment and appliances. Based on EPA survey data [ICF, 1988]
and discussion with industry experts, OSHA and CONSAD estimate that 25 plants, employing a total of 1,415 workers,
currently manufacture primary friction materials [CONSAD, 1990; OSHA, 1994].

Gaskets and packings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Asbestos gaskets are used in static situations to avoid leakage, whereas asbestos packings are used in dynamic applications,
such as pumps and valves, to control leakage where motion takes place. According to OSHA and CONSAD's profile of the
industry, 130 production workers in 7 establishments are exposed to asbestos.

Coatings and sealants. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos fiber is used as a filler and reinforcer in asphalt and tar-based surface coatings. These products are then
used as roof sealants, waterproofing coatings, automobile undercoatings, protective coatings for underground
pipelines, anti-condensation coatings for low-temperature refrigeration services and fireproofing for structural
steel. OSHA estimates that 1,181 production workers in 75 coatings and sealants plants are affected by the revised
standard.

Asbestos-reinforced plastic molding compounds are used in the electronic, automotive, and printing industries.
Primary manufacturers of asbestos-reinforced plastics produce molding compounds in pellet or flake form. These
plastics are used in commutators and rotors in electrical and automotive applications. Based on OSHA and CONSAD's
industry profile [CONSAD, 1990; OSHA, 1994], OSHA projects that one plastics plant, employing eighteen workers,
will be affected by the revised standard.

Automotive repair. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The general automotive repair and service sector includes establishments involved in brake and clutch repair work
and maintenance. The major source of asbestos exposure in this sector occurs when compressed air is used for blowing
the residual dust from the brake lining assembly. In addition, minor exposures in brake repair can occur during spray
applications and when handling cloths and other supplies contaminated with asbestos fibers. Replacement of clutch
assemblies can also lead to fiber release. CONSAD estimates that approximately 329,000 automobile repair shops
and garages, brake and clutch repair establishments, and motor vehicle dealers, employing 676,000 workers, will
be affected by the revision to the asbestos standard. OSHA is mandating specific engineering controls and work practices
that will affect this sector.

Shipbuilding and repairing_historical contact with asbestos in shipyard work. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revision to the shipyard asbestos standard affects the shipbuilding and repairing industry, SIC 3731. Shipbuilding
and repairing is a large-scale manufacturing activity that requires both skilled and unskilled labor. Shipyard
work can be categorized into three main operations: (1) ship construction, (2) ship repair, and (3) ship overhaul.
Asbestos exposure occurs during those conversion, repair, or overhaul operations where asbestos-containing components
are removed or repaired. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos products were used extensively on American ships from the early 1940s through the late 1970s in joiner bulkhead
systems in living space; for insulation of steam and hot water pipes, boilers, and tanks in machinery space; in ceiling
tile; and in fire-resistant sheets in bulkheads [RTI, 1985]. However, after 1973, new specifications reduced the
use of asbestos on ships regulated by the Maritime Administration (MARAD). Use of asbestos was only permitted in insulation
cement in lagging for machinery casings and in lagging cloth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1978, specifications for government-subsidized ships have required the elimination of all asbestos lagging
and insulation materials. Therefore, current ship building activities ordinarily do not generate any worker exposure
to asbestos. However, OSHA believes that all ships delivered before 1975 contain extensive asbestos insulation
materials, and that ships delivered between 1975 and 1978 contain asbestos in the form of insulating cement on machinery
casings. Potential asbestos exposures occur when workers contact these materials during maintenance and repair
activities [OSHA, 1986]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Occupational exposure to asbestos. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The greatest potential for occupational exposure to asbestos occurs during removal activities due to sawing, tearing,
cutting, and scraping operations. Additional sources of asbestos exposure, involving a small number of shipyard
workers, occur during repair activities such as removal and installation of gaskets [OSHA, 1986]. Whenever possible,
asbestos is thoroughly wetted during removal activities. However, wet removal in nuclear reactor compartments
is not permitted because of possible radiation contamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shipyards are owned by both the private sector and the U.S. Navy. Private sector shipyards can be classified into three
categories: (1) major shipyards engaged in construction and/or repair with drydocking facilities; (2) smaller
``second-tier'' shipyards that service inland waterways and coastal commerce and that build and repair smaller
vessels; and (3) ``topside'' repair facilities that work on ships while they remain in the water.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The number of reported firms in SIC 3731, Ship Building and Repairing, has differed in recent years among traditional
data sources. Many ``firms'' classified within the industry are very small, perform shipyard work only intermittently,
or are marginal firms with short tenure. The 1987 Census of Manufactures included 590 shipyards (287 with twenty or
more employees) operated by 547 companies [Dept. of Commerce, 1990a]. The Commerce Department's 1993 Industrial
Outlook estimates a total of 585 establishments [U.S. Industrial Outlook, 1993]. However, in 1987, the Commission
on Merchant Marine and Defense reported the existence of only 305 ``working'' shipyards [Merchant Marine Commission,
1987]. In their 1991 Report on Survey of U.S. Shipbuilding and Repair Facilities, the Maritime Administration reported
that ``over 200 privately-owned firms are involved in repairing ships in the United States'' [Dept. of Transportation,
1991]. In addition to the private-sector shipyards, there are currently eight Navy-owned shipyards and two Navy-owned
ship repair facilities [U.S. Industrial Outlook, 1993]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employment in the shipbuilding and repair industry_as high as 184,000 in 1981_was 118,000 in October 1992 according
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS, 1993]. Employment has also declined in government-owned shipyards. In 1990
the five largest firms employed 81,000 workers while the 12 largest firms (all with at least 1,000 workers) employed
98,000 workers [Dept. of Transportation, 1990]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The largest percentage of asbestos work is performed in major shipyards [OSHA, 1991 (Ocken, p. 395)]. OSHA and CONSAD
identified a range of 13 to 23 major shipyards as potentially affected by the revision to the asbestos standard [OSHA,
1994]. These establishments employ approximately 74,000 to 80,500 workers, of which an estimated three percent,
or 2,220 to 2,415 workers, perform maintenance and repair activities [RTI, 1985; OSHA, 1994]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As shown in Table 2, OSHA analyzed impacts in two areas of ship repair: wet removal/repair and dry removal/repair.
Dry removal and repair occur in ship compartments, such as in nuclear powered vessels, where wet methods are infeasible.
Based on OSHA and CONSAD's profile of the ship repair industry, OSHA estimates that 18 shipyards, employing 985 workers,
are affected by the revised standard.

Market conditions in the shipbuilding industry. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the 1980s, the shipbuilding industry experienced a sharp decline in output due to (1) competition from subsidized
foreign shipbuilders; (2) decreased demand for new ships caused by excess supply; (3) the elimination of some subsidies
for U.S. shipbuilders; and (4) a relaxation of the requirements for foreign ships entering the U.S. commercial fleet.
No commercial ships were built in the United States between 1985 and 1990, and only four have been built or under construction
since 1990. However, due to the requirements of the Jones Act, American shipyards still build all vessels used in domestic
commerce_smaller ships, barges, and tugboats. Industry forecasts also predict that the demand for commercial ships
will ``increase significantly'' during the 1990s due to the need for replacement of an aging world merchant fleet
[U.S. Industrial Outlook, 1993]. It remains to be seen what fraction of this business may be won by U.S. shipbuilders.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast to the declining market for commercial ship construction, the market for ship repair and conversion work
is strong. The U.S. Industrial Outlook reports that ``the demand for some ship repair services *&blank;*&blank;*
exceeds what is currently available in certain areas.'' In addition, investments by U.S. shipyards to improve, expand,
and modernize repairing facilities are proceeding. Investment in fiscal year 1992 was $215 million, contrasted
with $176 million for purchases of plant, machinery and equipment in 1991 [U.S. Industrial Outlook, 1993].

Asbestos in Construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The construction industry is the principal market for asbestos materials and products in the United States, accounting
for 68 percent of the asbestos consumed in 1992 [Bureau of Mines, 1993]. Asbestos products used in construction include
asbestos-cement pipe, asbestos-cement sheet, coatings, compounds, packings, and roofing products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the decline in consumption of raw asbestos in U.S. manufacturing coupled with the introduction of asbestos substitutes
into product design, the asbestos construction industry has shifted away from activities associated with installing
asbestos products. Instead, in the last decade concern over the public risk presented by damaged asbestos in place,
as well as the practical need to maintain aging interior sections in commercial and residential buildings, has directed
the asbestos construction industry to the areas of demolition, removal, and renovation. In addition, custodial
personnel occasionally come into contact with asbestos during their housekeeping duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The construction industry is comprised of a large number of firms: approximately 536,300 establishments in 1987,
employing just over 5 million workers [Dept. of Commerce, 1990b]. Of this industry total, 423,500 establishments,
or 79 percent, employed fewer than 10 workers, while only 9.3 percent had 20 or more employees. The prevalence of small
firms is partially related to the ease of entry into the construction industry. To establish a construction firm generally
requires minimal capitalization; many firms, in fact, achieve success by carrying little overhead and adapting
their services to industry trends. Furthermore, a sizable share of proprietorships in the industry are composed
of self-employed individuals who contract their own services, and who shift back and forth from employee status to
self-employment status as opportunities change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In construction, unlike manufacturing, the typical industry end-product is highly differentiated and is produced
at a site selected by the purchaser. Due to this degree of product specificity, each worksite usually has its own pattern
of material use, building methods, and number and mix of workers. Thus, considerable variation may exist in actual
worker use of, or contact with, asbestos materials and products. Although the occasional use of asbestos products
appears to be the norm_particularly given the changing material use patterns in new construction_some workers (e.g.
asbestos pipe installers and abatement/removal specialists) continually come into contact with asbestos materials
and products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Worker mobility, resulting in considerable shifting among both job sites and employers is another characteristic
of the industry. Workers tend to identify with their craft or occupation, not with their employer [Lange and Mills,
1979]. Cyclical changes in the economy and seasonal work patterns cause variability of job opportunities, with a
large portion of workers frequently entering and exiting the industry. Collectively, these factors make it very
difficult to estimate the total number of workers exposed to asbestos and the duration of their exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon profiles of the asbestos construction industry by OSHA and CONSAD [OSHA, 1994; CONSAD, 1990], OSHA in this
final RIA has estimated the number of construction workers potentially exposed in the areas affected by the standard_that
is, where asbestos products are installed, replaced, removed, or managed in place. Affected construction activities
are found within the following general sectors: new construction; abatement and demolition; building renovation
and remodeling; routine maintenance; and custodial work. Table 3 presents OSHA's profile of the population at risk
from occupational exposure to asbestos in construction. Below are descriptions of the construction activities
categorized within the general sectors affected by OSHA's revised asbestos standard.

 New construction activities account for the bulk of asbestos materials and products consumed in a typical year. Major
products include asbestos-cement pipe, asbestos-cement sheet, coatings and compounds, and roofing products.
As depicted in Table 1, these construction products comprised over half (19 thousand metric tons) of the total U.S.
asbestos consumption in 1992.

Asbestos-cement pipe.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Asbestos-cement pipe (A/C pipe) is used chiefly for transporting drinking water in a pressurized condition and to
provide drainage for storm water, sewage and other liquid waste. Approximately 90 percent of A/C pipe purchases are
of pressure water pipe [AIA, Ex. 117, 1991]. A/C pipe is also used in industrial applications, to carry gaseous products,
and as an electrical conduit for heating, cooling and gas venting [ICF, 1988]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of A/C pipe in the United States is concentrated in the Mountain, Pacific and Southwest regions. In 1991, the Asbestos
Information Association commented [Ex. 117] that ``pre-cut, pre-tapped pipe has received tremendous marketplace
acceptance and represents a large majority of sales.'' This is significant because the use of pre-cut, pre-tapped
pipe may reduce or eliminate some types of field fabrication activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A/C pipe is composed of 15&hyph;25 percent asbestos, 42&hyph;53 percent Portland cement, and 34&hyph;40 percent
ground silica sand. The use of raw asbestos in the production of A/C pipe fluctuated somewhat but remained fairly constant
during the mid-1980s (26,100 metric tons in 1983, 37,000 metric tons in 1984, 32,691 metric tons in 1985) [ICF, 1988]
but has declined dramatically since: 7,900 metric tons in 1989, 1,700 metric tons in 1992 [Bureau of Mines, 1993].
The use of substitutes for asbestos and the overall slump in new construction in the early 1990s probably account for
much of the decline in asbestos consumption in A/C pipe. Based on OSHA and CONSAD's profile of the industry, OSHA estimates
that 224 to 2,100 workers, or an average of 1,162 workers, are exposed to asbestos during installation of A/C pipe.

Asbestos-cement sheet.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Asbestos-cement sheet (A/C sheet) has a variety of uses as a structural, technical and decorative material in large
residential buildings, electrical utilities, industrial plants, schools, and hospitals. A/C sheet includes flat
sheet, corrugated sheet, and roofing and side shingles. Of these four main types of A/C sheet, all, as of the date of
ICF's market survey, were produced in the United States with the exception of corrugated sheet [ICF, 1988]. According
to ICF, flat A/C sheet has the following principal applications: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Wall lining in factories and agricultural buildings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fire-resistant walls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Curtain walls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Industrial partitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Soffit material (covering the underside of structural components 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Interior and exterior decorative paneling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specialized applications of flat A/C sheet include its use in cooling towers, as laboratory table tops and fume hoods,
and as a component of vaults, ovens, safes, heaters, and boilers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos-cement shingles are used as siding and roofing for residential and commercial buildings. According to
results from ICF's market survey, demand for roofing shingles represents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
70 percent of consumption in the A/C shingle market while demand for siding shingles constitute the remainder of the
market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A/C sheet may contain anywhere from 15 to 40 percent asbestos, in combination with cement and, occasionally, silica
[Cogley, et al., 1982]. In recent years, manufacturers have substituted other materials for asbestos in the production
of A/C sheet; meanwhile, due to unit price differences, alternative construction components such as pre-cast concrete
and cement/wood board have replaced A/C sheet in the building industry [OSHA, 1986]. Together, these factors have
contributed to a decline in asbestos consumption in the A/C sheet market from levels of roughly 11,000 metric tons
of raw asbestos in the early 1980s [OSHA, 1986] to a 1992 consumption of under 100 metric tons (see Table 1). OSHA estimates
that, the population at risk during A/C sheet installation ranges from 270 to 2,160 workers, or an average of 1,215
employees.

Asbestos abatement and demolition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Increased health concerns regarding the potential release of asbestos fibers have prompted a desire to remove or
encapsulate such materials in existing buildings. In response to this demand, a variety of specialty contractors
and construction trades have become active in asbestos abatement, particularly in schools, where EPA regulations
have indirectly generated a large market for this type of service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The asbestos abatement industry experienced extraordinary growth in the 1980s due to legal, regulatory, economic
and health-related factors. Rifkin-Wernick Associates [Rifkin-Wernick, 1990], specialists in analyzing the
asbestos industry, estimate that combined public and private building ownership spent $4.2 billion in 1989 for services
and products related to asbestos abatement in their properties. This level of abatement expenditures represented
an increase of 24 percent over levels in 1988. According to Rifkin-Wernick, asbestos construction activities associated
with demolition, renovation, and operations and maintenance accounted for around 90 percent of abatement expenditures;
the remainder of abatement expenditures satisfied legal or economic considerations while addressing lower-level
safety concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rifkin-Wernick reports that approximately 50 percent of asbestos abatement business in 1989 occurred in eight states:
California, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Florida and Michigan. Of the $4.2 billion in abatement
expenditures in 1989, commercial buildings (offices, retail establishments, hotels/motels and warehouses) accounted
for $1.4 billion in abatement services. Industrial buildings accounted for nearly $1 billion in asbestos abatement
expenditures, while abatement in schools totalled $800 million, or roughly one-fifth of the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In early 1990, 2,100 asbestos abatement contractors operated in the United States under either state certification
or some other license. Rifkin-Wernick estimates that abatement contractors in 1989 employed 161,000 workers, of
which 98,000 were full-time. Firm size in the industry was generally small: 80 percent of contractors employ fewer
than 50 people and over half of asbestos contractors have no part-time employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contractor revenues in 1989 totalled $3.6 billion. Rifkin-Wernick classified contractors by revenue size and geographic
radius of operation. National contractors are defined as conducting business beyond 1,000 miles of headquarters
and with revenues above $20 million. Regional contractors, in Rifkin-Wernick's classification system, tend to
operate 250 to 1,000 miles from the main office and earn revenues of $5 million to $20 million. Finally, local contractors
operate primarily within a 250-mile radius of home and earn under $5 million. Table 4 presents Rifkin-Wernick's 1990
assessment of contractor market concentration for two earlier years and market projection for 1994.

In developing its profile of the abatement and demolition industry, OSHA [OSHA, 1994], recognized the growth in market
specialization observed by Rifkin-Wernick and other experts. Therefore, OSHA applied lower-bound worker population
estimates to the cost and benefit analysis. For all of abatement and demolition, OSHA estimates a full-time workforce
of 21,295 persons.

OSHA notes that its estimate for the number of full-time abatement workers is lower than Rifkin-Wernick's 1989 estimate.
OSHA believes that this discrepancy may possibly be due to three factors: 1) the cyclical decline in the industry during
the recession of 1990&hyph;1991 and subsequent slow recovery; 2) increased specialization among abatement workers
and the adoption of labor-saving technologies and work practices; and 3) the inclusion of abatement workers in other
activity groups within OSHA's industry profile.

The principal general renovation activities that entail occupational exposure to asbestos are: the demolition

felts, and the removal of asbestos flooring products. OSHA and CONSAD [OSHA, 1994] estimate that anywhere from 60,735
to 95,914 workers_all of whom are full-time professionals_may be at risk from asbestos exposure during renovation
and remodeling. OSHA believes that specialization has emerged in the industry to the extent that a lower-bound estimate
of the workforce is appropriate in this impact analysis. Consequently, OSHA estimates that 60,735 full-time-equivalent
workers in renovation and remodeling of asbestos-containing buildings are affected by the revised standard.

Drywall demolition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The occupational exposure to asbestos associated with the demolition and renovation of drywall results primarily
from the release of asbestos fibers from the spackling, tape, and joint compounds used to produce a smooth surface
across the entire wall. Although the use of asbestos in drywall tape and spackling compound is now prohibited, asbestos-containing
finishing materials were routinely used in drywall application through the early 1970s. Thus, the demolition and
renovation of drywall in any building constructed prior to the mid-1970s is likely to expose workers to friable asbestos.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On occasion, drywall renovation involves contact with sprayed- and troweled-on fireproofing and other asbestos
surfacing material. Information on the frequency of contact with high-risk asbestos-containing material during
drywall renovation is limited but suggests that a minor percentage of projects are affected [CONSAD, 1985]. OSHA
estimates that 20 percent of drywall renovations involve contact with high-risk ACM. A breakdown of the worker population
for drywall renovation is given below under

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Built up roofs constructed with asbestos roofing felts generally have long useful lives of 20 or more years. CONSAD
[CONSAD, 1990] used Bureau of Mines data on production of roofing felt in the 1960s to estimate that approximately
80,000 tons of asbestos-containing roofing products will be removed annually.

Removal of asbestos flooring products.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos flooring products, also termed ``resilient floor coverings,'' include vinyl/asbestos floor tile, asphalt/asbestos
floor tile, and sheet flooring backed with asbestos felt. Asbestos flooring products are estimated to be in over 3.6
million buildings [EPA, 1984]. Although these floors have a useful life of approximately 25&hyph;30 years, they
are generally replaced more often [RFCI, 1990].

Routine maintenance in public, commercial and residential buildings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Routine building maintenance activities can involve exposure to asbestos because of the presence of products containing
asbestos. Worker exposure can be a result of direct contact with the asbestos materials and products or can result
from disturbance of settled dust in the vicinity of asbestos-containing materials (for example, when work above
a drop ceiling is performed where asbestos-containing insulation or fireproofing was used). Maintenance activities
that can involve asbestos exposure include: adjustment or repair of HVAC ductwork or lighting (above a drop ceiling);
replacement of drop ceiling tiles; repair of leaking water or steam pipes; boiler maintenance or repair activities;
and repairs to roofing, drywall or flooring. Workers at risk during these activities include in-house building maintenance
personnel, contract maintenance crews, and special trades contractors. Based on an industry profile by CONSAD [CONSAD,
1990], OSHA estimates that anywhere from 128,867 workers to 740,237 workers are potentially exposed while performing
routine maintenance activities in public, commercial and residential buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this economic impact analysis, OSHA assumed that owners of affected buildings will minimize compliance costs
by applying maintenance personnel_whether in-house or contract_to asbestos projects on a full-time basis, where
possible. Under this assumption, the absolute number of affected workers would equal the lower-bound estimate for
the population at risk (128,867 workers). In terms of person-years of exposure (number of persons exposed over a year
of eight-hour days), the lower-bound population at risk equates to 25,771 full-time-equivalent persons, as shown
in Column 3 in Table 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Renovation, maintenance, and repair operations comprise a significant portion of total construction activity.
In 1987, receipts from maintenance and repair operations alone were $50.4 billion, or 10 percent of total construction
receipts [Dept. of Commerce, 1990b].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general industry, routine maintenance and repair can involve the disturbance of asbestos-containing materials
and products (ACM), including such products as gaskets, pipe and boiler insulation, electronic components and structural
building materials. Asbestos industrial materials and products are most widely used in (1) the manufacture of malt
beverages, paper products, chemicals, petroleum products, glass and ceramics, iron and steel, and fabricated metal
products; (2) telephone communications; (3) electric utilities; and (4) other public utilities (gas, water, sanitary
services). Occupational exposure to asbestos fibers can occur among maintenance workers directly involved in disturbance
of ACM as well as among production workers near the maintenance work site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this final analysis of the costs and benefits of the revised asbestos standard, OSHA identified five general types
of routine maintenance in industrial facilities, listed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Gasket removal and installation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Boiler removal and installation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Pipe removal and installation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Miscellaneous maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Miscellaneous telecommunications maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Miscellaneous maintenance includes the variety of building maintenance (ceiling work, roofing, drywall, etc.)
described above under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Routine Maintenance in Public, Commercial, and Residential Buildings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Miscellaneous telecommunications maintenance includes 1) removal of electronic components, particularly line
card resistors, insulated with asbestos and 2) placement or removal of communications wire and cable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 3 presents the range of workers in general industry potentially exposed to asbestos during routine maintenance
tasks. In this impact analysis, OSHA assumes that, to minimize compliance costs, affected establishments will concentrate
asbestos maintenance duties among a group of trained specialists. Shown in Column 3 in the table are OSHA's estimates
for full-time populations at risk for each maintenance activity. For all of general industry, a total of 2,711 full-time-equivalent
persons perform construction-related duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Custodial work in public, commercial and residential buildings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos exposure in public and commercial buildings can occur during a variety of tasks involving disturbance of
asbestos or asbestos-containing materials, in addition to routine maintenance activities described above. Custodial
work in buildings with ACM can include any of the following types of activities: sweeping; cleaning; dusting; mopping;
vacuuming; stripping and buffing of vinyl-asbestos floor tile; and clean-up after asbestos removal or other significant
asbestos construction work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A recent EPA-sponsored study of asbestos exposure among custodial workers in Missouri reports frequency and duration
of custodial activities [Wickman, et al., 1992]. Modeling a custodial worker profile on the Missouri study and on
building survey data from EPA, OSHA and CONSAD estimated the range of workers potentially at risk [OSHA, 1994]. OSHA
estimates that anywhere from 1.1 million to 3.7 million workers are at risk from asbestos exposure during custodial
work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that there is presently little specialization in asbestos custodial work and that the actual number
of workers at risk approximates the average of the lower-bound and upper-bound number of workers. In terms of person-years
of exposure over work weeks consisting of eight-hour days, OSHA estimates that 223,160 full-time-equivalent workers
are at risk during custodial disturbance of asbestos or asbestos-containing materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Custodial work in industrial facilities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Custodial work in industrial facilities largely resembles custodial work in public, commercial, and residential
buildings and was identically modeled by CONSAD. The workforce at risk performing custodial activities in industrial
facilities ranges from 143,355 to 535,768 workers, as shown in Table 3. Taking the average of this range and calculating
the full-time-equivalent population, OSHA estimates that 31,442 person-years of exposure occur in general industry
annually during custodial work.

C. Assessment of Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The declared purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970 is ``*&blank;*&blank;* to assure so far
as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human
resources *&blank;*&blank;*'' Thus, the Act requires the Secretary of Labor, when promulgating occupational safety
and health standards for toxic materials or harmful physical agents, to set the standard `` *&blank;*&blank;* that
most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will
suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity *&blank;*&blank;*'' On the basis of this congressional
directive, OSHA has responded to the Court of Appeals by issuing a final revision to the asbestos standard, the intent
of which is to further reduce the adverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to asbestos. This
chapter reviews regulatory and non-regulatory alternatives that OSHA considered and found to be inadequate for
full remediation of the occupational hazards of asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Private Markets and Occupational Health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Economic theory suggests that the need for government regulation is greatly reduced where private markets work efficiently
and effectively to allocate health and safety resources. The theory typically assumes perfectly competitive labor
markets where workers, having perfect knowledge of job risks and being perfectly mobile among jobs, command wage
premiums that fully compensate for any risk of future harm. Thus, theoretically, the costs of occupational injury
and illness are borne initially by the firms responsible for the hazardous workplace conditions and, ultimately,
by the consumers who pay higher prices for the final goods and services produced by these firms. With all costs internalized,
private employers have an incentive to reduce hazards wherever the cost of hazard abatement is less than the cost of
the expected injury or illness. The resultant level of safety and health is considered ``efficient'' in the sense
that it minimizes the sum of the costs of hazard prevention and of injury or illness. Perfectly competitive labor markets,
however, do not exist for many industrial markets. OSHA, therefore, believes that it must take appropriate actions
to provide greater worker protection against exposures to toxic substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evidence indicates that market forces have not been effective in reducing excessive occupational exposure to asbestos,
thereby contributing to the development of diseases related to it. In spite of the hazards associated with asbestos,
the social costs of production have not been internalized, in part because of market imperfections and the existence
of externalities. Consequently, the amount of protection that the private market will offer to workers differs from
the socially desired level, for the following reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, evidence on occupational health hazards in general suggests that, in the absence of immediate or clear-cut
danger, employees and employers have little incentive to seek or provide information on the potential long-term
effects of exposure. When relevant information is provided, however, employers and employees might still find informed
decision making a difficult task, especially where long latency periods precede the development of disease. Moreover,
if signs and symptoms are nonspecific_that is, if an illness could be job-related or could have other causes_employees
and employers may not link disease with exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, even if workers were fully informed of the health risks associated with exposure to asbestos, many face limited
employment options. Non-transferability of occupational skills and high regional unemployment rates sharply
reduce a worker's expectation of obtaining alternative employment quickly or easily. A worker employed in resurfacing
automobile brakes, for example, could find it difficult to apply occupational skills to a new job in searching for
a safer workplace. In many regions of the country, the practical choice for workers is not between a safe job and a better
paying but more hazardous position, but simply between employment and unemployment at the prevailing rates of pay
and risk. In addition to the fear of substantial income loss from prolonged periods of unemployment, the high costs
of relocation, the reluctance to break family and community ties, and the growth of institutional factors such as
pension plans and seniority rights serve to elevate the cost of job transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the market imperfections, externalities result in employers and employees settling for an inefficiently
low level of protection from toxic substances. For the competitive market to function efficiently, only workers
and their employers should be affected by the level of safety and health provided in market transactions. In the case
of occupational safety and health, however, society shares part of the financial burden of occupationally induced
diseases, including the costs of premature death, excess sickness, and disability. Individuals who suffer from
occupationally related illness are cared for and compensated by society through taxpayer support of social programs,
including welfare, Social Security, and Medicare. These combined factors of labor market imperfections and the
existence of externalities prevent the market from delivering an optimal supply of healthful working conditions
in industries where asbestos hazards exist.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Tort Liability and Asbestos Litigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Greater reliance on the use of liability under tort law is one of the examples of a non-regulatory alternative identified
and set forth by the Office of Management and Budget guidelines for implementing Executive Orders 12866 and 12291.
Prosser [Prosser, 1971] describes a tort, in part, as a ``civil wrong, other than a breach of contract, for which the
court will provide a remedy in the form of an action for damages,'' although he says that ``a really satisfactory definition
has yet to be found.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the tort system effectively applied, it would allow a worker whose health has been adversely affected by occupational
exposure to asbestos to sue and recover damages from the employer. Furthermore, the tort system would shift the liability
of direct costs of occupational disease from the worker to the firm under certain specific circumstances. The tort
system has had limited success in shifting the cost of occupational disease. The limitations of the system are discussed
in the following paragraphs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos product liability litigation as a means of reducing worker exposure to asbestos has proven effective in
some areas, but cumbersome to resolve. The difficulties are inherent in the litigation process as it relates to asbestos
products and in the nature of the diseases associated with asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With very limited exceptions, however, the tort system is not a viable alternative in dealings between employees
and their employers. All states have legislation providing that Workers' Compensation is either the exclusive or
principal remedy available to employees against their employers. Thus, tort law can only be applied to third-party
suppliers of a hazardous substance. It is often difficult, however, to demonstrate cause, which is a necessary prerequisite
for the successful application of tort liability against these suppliers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, knowledge of the worker exposure must exist. The worker and/or the physician must be aware of both the magnitude
and duration of exposure to asbestos and the causal link between the disease and the occupational exposure. Furthermore,
it could be extremely difficult to isolate the role of occupational exposures in causing the disease, especially
if workers are exposed to many toxic substances. Second, the liable party must be identifiable, but workers may have
several employers over a working lifetime. Third, the scientific and medical evidence available to support the contention
that the disease was caused by job-related exposure must withstand judicial standards for proof of causality. This
task is very difficult because of the long latency periods associated with asbestos-related diseases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The costs associated with producing information and with litigation itself may be quite substantial. First, information
is a public good, which means that once produced it can be transmitted inexpensively to any number of individuals without
diminishing the quality or quantity of the information. It is, therefore, difficult to control distribution once
the information is produced. A producer of information may find that information produced at great expense can be
acquired freely by potential customers, and that, consequently, the market for the information has virtually disappeared.
As a result, public goods are typically underproduced relative to what is considered economically efficient. This
general undersupply of information adversely affects the workers' awareness of the cause of their illness and thus
reduces the likelihood that they will pursue tort liability suits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, legal proceedings impose costs on both plaintiffs and defendants. Victims of torts must incur legal fees
associated with bringing about court action. In deciding whether to sue, the victim must be sure that the size of the
claim will be large enough to cover legal expenses. In effect, the plaintiff is likely to face substantial transaction
costs in the form of legal expenses. These are commonly set at a 33 percent contingency for the plaintiff's lawyer,
plus legal expenses. The accused firm must also pay for its defense. A report prepared by the Research Triangle Institute
[RTI, 1982], contains some data pertaining to legal costs and the size of awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One investigator, for example, found that an average ratio of legal costs to proceeds was 37 percent for a sample of
cases. The data, however, do not separate legal fees paid by the defendants and plaintiffs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of occupational disease tort activity has involved workers exposed to asbestos. These employees could
avoid the exclusive remedy of Workers' Compensation by suing suppliers, whereas asbestos exposures are best controlled
by employers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a consolidated class-action case in 1990, a Texas court awarded more than $3.5 million in compensatory damages
to 2,366 workers who had been exposed to asbestos in refineries. Punitive damages were to be awarded on the basis of
gross negligence on the part of the suppliers [Dallas Morning News, 1990]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, a settlement was reached in a lawsuit involving future personal injury claims against 20 asbestos product
manufacturers represented by the Center for Claims Resolution (Carlough v. Amchem Products, Inc). It would provide
$1 billion over the next ten years to settle about 100,000 claims as people exposed to the manufacturers' products
contract asbestos-related conditions. Payments would depend on the type of condition and attorneys' fees would
be capped at 25 percent of each payment [BNA, 1993]. The settlement was reached by parties aware of the decades-long
impasses in asbestos litigation that have frustrated the tort liability process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is unusual for insurance and liability costs to be borne in full by the specific employer responsible for the risk
involved. For firms using insurance, the premium determination process is such that premiums only partially reflect
changes in risk associated with changes in asbestos or other hazardous exposures. This results in the so-called ``moral
hazard problem,'' which is the risk that arises from the possible dishonesty or imprudence of the insured. As the insured
has paid for an insurance company to assume some of his or her risks, he or she has less reason to exercise the diligence
necessary to avoid losses. This transfer of risk is a fundamental source of imperfection in markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For firms that self-insure or carry liability insurance with a large deductible, the costs of a single claim may be
fully borne by the firm. Very small firms, and large firms with a large number of claims, however, may fail to meet the
full costs by declaring bankruptcy, as has happened with Johns Manville and other former asbestos producers. The
attempts at financial restructuring by defendants of asbestos litigation further reduce the chances that workers
who contract asbestos-related diseases as employees of these companies or as employees of companies that used their
products will collect compensation [Washington Post, 1990].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Workers' Compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Workers' Compensation system came about as the result of perceived inadequacies in liability or insurance systems
to compel employers to prevent occupational disease or compensate workers fully for their losses. This system was
designed to internalize some of the social costs of production, but in reality it has fallen short of compensating
workers adequately for occupationally related disease. Thus, society shares the burden of occupationally related
adverse health effects, premature mortality, excess morbidity, and disability through taxpayer support of social
programs such as welfare, Social Security disability payments, and Medicare.

Government Regulations and Rejected Alternative Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to compensate for market imperfections (some of which are detailed above), a number of federal and state regulations
have been promulgated in the attempt to improve the allocation of resources. While some of these regulations may have
a limiting effect on occupational exposures to asbestos, OSHA does not believe that these regulations obviate the
need for an OSHA standard regulating occupational exposure to asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's current permissible exposure level (PEL) for asbestos of 0.2 fibers per cubic centimeter (f/cc) does not eliminate
all significant risk to workers. Given the recent health evidence of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic hazards,
OSHA believes that to fully protect workers it is necessary to lower the asbestos PEL and establish ancillary provisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For public, commercial, residential and industrial buildings, OSHA rejected, on the basis of cost and feasibility
considerations, alternative approaches requiring owners to conduct up-front inspections for asbestos-containing
materials or to inspect before ACM is disturbed. These approaches have also been examined by the Environmental Protection
Agency. An analysis by EPA's contractor [Abt, 1992] projected potential compliance costs of $13.2 billion to $16.2
billion for an up-front survey approach and potential costs of $3.2 billion to $14.5 billion for an identify-before-disturb
option. OSHA's approach, instead, specifies parameters for making reasonable assumptions about the presence of
asbestos-containing materials within building components and notifying and protecting maintenance workers,
custodians and building occupants as prescribed elsewhere in the revised standard.

D. Benefits of the Revision to the Final Asbestos Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The inhalation of asbestos fiber has been clearly associated with three clinical conditions: asbestosis, mesothelioma
(a cancer of the lining of the chest or abdomen), and lung cancer. Studies have also observed increased gastrointestinal
cancer risk. Risk from cancer at other sites, such as the larynx, pharynx, and kidneys, is also suspected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial exposure limits for asbestos were based on efforts to reduce asbestosis which was known to be associated with
asbestos exposure. The reduction in cases of asbestosis, however, resulted in workers living long enough to develop
cancers that are now recognized as associated with asbestos exposure. The following discussion of the benefits associated
with a reduction in exposures, therefore, focuses on the number of cancer cases avoided within the exposed work force.
The results are expressed in terms of deaths avoided because these cancers almost always result in death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA calculated expected benefits following promulgation of the final revised asbestos standard for workers employed
in the general industry, shipyards, and construction sectors. In this benefits analysis, the following types of
preventable asbestos-related cancer mortalities were evaluated: (1) Preventable lung cancers, (2) preventable
mesotheliomas, and (3) preventable gastrointestinal cancers. The risk assessment used to derive OSHA's estimate
of the number of cancers prevented is discussed in Chapter 5 of the regulatory impact analysis of the 1986 final asbestos
standard [OSHA, 1986]. For this analysis, OSHA updated the 1986 risk assessment to include 1991 data on the gender
and age distribution within affected industry sectors [BLS, 1991] and the 1991 mortality rates associated with malignant
neoplasms of respiratory and intrathoracic organs [NCHS, 1993]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefits of a reduction in the PEL depend upon current exposure levels, the number of workers exposed, and the risk
associated with each exposure level. OSHA's estimates for current exposures, the number of full-time equivalent
workers exposed, and the exposure levels after compliance with the revision to the final rule are presented in Table
5 for general industry and shipyards and Table 6 for construction.

OSHA calculated annual preventable cancers associated with the revised standard through a five-step procedure.
First, OSHA estimated baseline occupational exposure levels_in terms of 8-hour time-weighted average fiber levels_for
all affected sectors using data from the record and from previous asbestos regulatory impact analyses. Then, applying
the OSHA/Nicholson risk assessment model to baseline exposures and the associated populations at risk, OSHA calculated
baseline cancers among affected workers. In the third step, OSHA estimated occupational exposure levels as a result
of compliance with the final standard, using assigned protection factors for designated controls. OSHA then projected
total residual cancers following promulgation of the standard. Finally, OSHA calculated the number of compliance-related
preventable cancers by subtracting the number of residual cancers from the number of baseline cancers.

Occupational Exposure Profile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For each sector affected by the revised asbestos standard, OSHA assessed current occupational exposures using data
from past regulatory impact analyses and the rulemaking records for this final standard and for previous OSHA asbestos
standards. Principal sources of exposure data for this final RIA were Economic and Technological Profile Related
to OSHA's Revised Permanent Asbestos Standard for the Construction Industry and Asbestos Removal and Routine Maintenance
Projects in General Industry prepared by OSHA's contractor CONSAD Research Corporation [CONSAD, 1985]; Economic
Analysis of the Proposed Revisions to the OSHA Asbestos Standards for Construction and General Industry, also by
CONSAD [CONSAD, 1990]; OSHA's 1986 final asbestos regulatory impact analysis [OSHA, 1986]; and OSHA's regulatory
analysis of the excursion limit [OSHA, 1988]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Average exposures and the range of exposures reported in CONSAD [CONSAD, 1985, 1990] and OSHA [1986] were developed
from a review of the record for the rulemaking proceeding that led to promulgation of the current OSHA asbestos standard.
Baseline exposures described in the literature and reported by CONSAD in 1985 generally reflected the use of minimal
engineering controls and the virtual absence of respiratory protection. These baseline exposures were reported
by OSHA in its 1986 RIA and served to establish baseline risk estimates for affected workers prior to compliance with
the final standard promulgated in 1986. In its 1986 RIA, OSHA assumed that the controls implied by compliance with
the 1986 standard would result in specified rates of effectiveness and would lead to benefits in preventable cancers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this final RIA for the revised asbestos standard, OSHA developed an exposure profile for affected occupational
groups using representative data from the 1986 RIA, from CONSAD reports [1985, 1990] and from the rulemaking record.
For each affected sector, OSHA estimated baseline exposures using the following assumptions: (1) Where reasonable
and appropriate, engineering controls and work practices assigned in the 1986 RIA were assumed to be in current use;
(2) where engineering controls and work practices were not sufficient to reduce maximum exposures to a PEL of 0.2 f/cc
and an excursion level of 1.0 f/cc, OSHA assumed that the least-cost respiratory protection would be applied. OSHA's
baseline exposure profile for this revision to the asbestos standard thus reflects industry application of controls,
work practices and respirators to achieve permissible limits established under the OSHA 1986 and 1988 rulemakings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 5 presents average baseline exposure levels for general industry and shipyards and Table 6 presents average
baseline exposure levels for construction. Tables 5 and 6, in addition, show average baseline exposure levels in
the absence of respiratory protection and other primary controls and work practices (Column 2 in Table 5, Column 3
in Table 6), taken from representative data in the rulemaking record (see [CONSAD, 1985] and [CONSAD, 1984]). Also
shown in Table 6 are representative exposure levels (Column 4) in the absence of respiratory protection. Fiber levels
prior to respirator use were estimated by applying, to potential mean exposure levels (Column 3), protection factors
for wet methods, glove bags and other controls judged currently in use, at hypothetical application levels of 100
percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mean exposures in nearly all sectors are estimated to be at or below the current PEL and excursion limit, consistent
with the assumptions in the 1986 RIA and 1988 excursion limit analysis of 100 percent compliance with the final standards.
For most of the sectors presented in the tables, OSHA's estimated current exposure levels were determined by applying,
to baseline exposures in the absence of controls, protection factors ranging from 10 to 1000, adjusted to reflect
current application of controls. In that real-world application of engineering controls and work practices is under
100 percent in nearly all asbestos construction sectors, mean current exposure levels (Column 5) can exceed representative
(hypothetical) fiber levels absent respirators (Column 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also shown in Tables 5 and 6 are OSHA's estimated exposure levels following the final revision to the standard. OSHA
projected exposure levels for each affected General Industry, Shipyards, and Construction activity by applying
protection factors to average baseline exposures. OSHA calculated protection factors for each activity by assuming
that controls have a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
multiplicative effect
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in reducing exposures, that is, the cumulative protection provided by a set of controls is the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
product
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of individual protection factors. OSHA assigned protection factors to all significant controls and calculated
cumulative protection factors for all affected sectors. Cumulative protection factors were then applied to baseline
exposures in order to determine exposures resulting from compliance with the final revised standard. As shown in
Column 3 in Table 5 and in Column 5 in Table 6, projected exposures are quite low (some below the level of detection),
commensurate with the high degree of protection provided by the controls required by, or, in some cases, implied by
the revised standard.

Benefits to workers in direct contact with asbestos.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Tables 5 and 6 present OSHA's estimated annual benefits to employees affected by the revised standard. Quantified
benefits represent the total of avoided cases of death from lung cancers, mesothelioma, and gastrointestinal cancers.
In general industry and shipyards, OSHA projects that wider use of engineering controls, work practices and respiratory
protection will result in 2.1 avoided cancer deaths. In construction, expected benefits total 40.5 avoided cancers.
Of these total avoided deaths resulting from compliance with the revised construction standard, 26.3 deaths will
be avoided through protection of personnel directly exposed to asbestos-containing material. However, OSHA's
analysis does not quantify benefits among those workers that may be secondarily exposed while present at sites where
asbestos work is being done. Among workers secondarily exposed are construction tradespersons_for example, plumbers,
electricians, and ceiling tile installers_whose activities can be complementary to, or immediately succeed, asbestos
work. Since OSHA's revised asbestos standard will reduce ambient asbestos levels at these sites, any exposure among
these workers would also be reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In custodial work in industrial buildings and in commercial and residential buildings, where 13.5 avoided cancers
are projected, estimated baseline average exposures (0.046 f/cc) lie below the revised PEL and are derived from data
in the asbestos exposure literature [Wickman, et al. 1992]. OSHA's estimate of current exposures to custodians and
other building service workers recognizes that these workers may not be receiving the protection afforded other
``construction'' workers who encounter asbestos on a more frequent basis. Service workers may, in fact, at times
be exposed to asbestos at levels exceeding the current PEL and excursion limit. OSHA believes that employees performing
custodial duties such as cleaning, sweeping, dusting, vacuuming and floor maintenance presently receive minimal
protection from asbestos exposure. This revised asbestos standard explicitly addresses risks to employees performing
custodial tasks; consequently, in this final analysis OSHA examined the occupational risks and estimated the expected
benefits to service workers in industrial, commercial and residential buildings.

Long-term exposures to building occupants. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data from the asbestos exposure literature reveal that ambient outdoor exposures to asbestos are quite low, averaging
roughly 0.00007 f/cc. Regarding indoor exposures, the Health Effects Institute_Asbestos Research reports that
for 1,377 air samples from 198 different buildings with asbestos-containing materials (ACM), mean exposures were
on the order of 0.00027 f/cc, with 90th and 95th percentiles of 0.0007 f/cc and 0.0014 f/cc [HEI&hyph;AR, 1991]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HEI&hyph;AR report indicates that improper handling of asbestos fibers can contribute significantly to higher
exposure levels to building occupants, even after completion of all asbestos removal jobs at a building. Of 18 building
projects where interior perimeter samples were taken, asbestos levels increased in 12 buildings after abatement.
The higher exposures were attributed to leakages in glove bags and improper work practices. While the effect of these
removal efforts on exposures varied widely, some exposures increased by a factor of 750 [HEI&hyph;AR, 1991, p. 5&hyph;30].
In at least one case, a building with previously non-detectable asbestos levels later was found to have detectable
levels of airborne asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the controls mandated by the standard_such as negative pressure enclosures, wet methods, critical
barriers, and HEPA vacuums, to name a few of the more protective controls_not only should help lower exposures to employees
working in and around them, but should also be nearly 100 percent effective in preventing migration of stray asbestos.
Controls required by the revised standard are therefore expected to enhance protection of service workers and building
occupants. While any building owner can choose to have ACM removed from a property, owners of buildings with higher
concentrations of asbestos, and therefore greater exposure potential for building employees and occupants, are
relatively more likely to opt for removal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Low-level asbestos concentrations can become elevated and remain elevated for long periods of time, as residual
asbestos is disturbed. Recent long-term data suggest that after a year's time, exposure levels cease to fall and may
actually rise [Wall Street Journal, 1993]. If new asbestos fibers are continually introduced to the general building
environment, background asbestos levels could remain elevated and potentially increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the Environmental Protection Agency's 1984 survey of buildings [EPA, 1984], OSHA estimates that approximately
156 million maintenance and custodial projects occur annually in 648,000 commercial and residential buildings
in which friable asbestos may be disturbed [OSHA, 1994]. Buildings containing friable asbestos constitute less
than 20 percent of all buildings with asbestos-containing materials and are believed to have the highest exposure
levels. Applying data from the Energy department and Census bureau, OSHA estimates that an average of 18 employees
per building are at risk annually from stray asbestos exposures in commercial buildings with friable asbestos, yielding
an estimated total population of 11.7 million employees (648,000 buildings &times; 18 employees per building) [Dept.
of Energy, 1986; Dept. of Commerce, 1993]. In this analysis OSHA assumed, based on data from HEI&hyph;AR on the distribution
of asbestos exposures in public buildings, that higher-risk buildings have a mean current baseline exposure of 0.0014
f/cc (95th percentile of HEI&hyph;AR data), in the absence of OSHA-mandated controls. OSHA further assumed that
the use of OSHA controls would lower mean background asbestos exposures to levels (0.00035 f/cc) projected by OSHA
for custodial workers. Applying these exposure levels to the asbestos risk model, OSHA estimated that 14.2 cancers
would be prevented annually among building occupants. It should be noted that this estimate is based solely on exposures
to

that compliance with the revised final rule will prevent approximately 14 cases of disabling asbestosis annually,
among workers directly exposed to asbestos in general industry, shipyards, and construction. In addition, non-quantified
benefits of avoided cases of asbestosis are anticipated for building occupants and others secondarily exposed.
As these cases represent disabilities and not deaths, they are not included in the total estimated benefits. Asbestosis
cases often lead to tremendous societal costs in terms of health care, worker productivity, and in the quality of life
to the affected individual. Their prevention, therefore, would have a positive economic effect.

Reduction of solvent exposures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Presently, approximately 25 percent of auto service establishments rely upon solvent sprays to control asbestos
exposure. The most commonly used solvent has been 1&hyph;1&hyph;1 trichloroethane, a neurotoxin. OSHA attempted
to establish a short-term exposure limit for this substance in the 1989 Air Contaminants rulemaking [54 FR 2333],
but that rulemaking was stayed by the courts for technical reasons. The revision to the final asbestos rule, by discouraging
the use of solvent spray as a control method, will prevent peak trichloroethane exposures to over 150,000 workers.
Moreover, 1&hyph;1&hyph;1 trichloroethane, a chlorofluorocarbon, has been linked with depletion of the ozone
layer, thereby possibly contributing to development of skin cancers. Partly as a result of this, some automotive
service establishments have switched to a spray based on perchloroethylene, a flammable carcinogen. OSHA believes
that as these establishments select control technologies that are feasible alternatives to solvent spray, there
will be reduced risks of cancer and fires (from rags contaminated with solvent) as a consequence of the revision to
the standard.

Building reoccupation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Significant economic benefits may be derived from lowering asbestos exposures to long-term building occupants.
The more rapidly that building owners, whether private or public, can put their asbestos-contaminated building
areas back into use, the sooner they can derive explicit or implicit ``rental'' value. For example, the HEI&hyph;AR
report discusses an asbestos abatement job at a college building with pre-abatement exposure levels of 0.0002 f/cc
[HEI&hyph;AR, 1991, p. 5&hyph;37]. Shortly after abatement, exposure levels of 0.065 f/cc were measured. After
26 weeks, exposure levels were measured at 0.0008 f/cc. Reoccupation occurred after 35 weeks, when exposures had
decreased to 0.0004 f/cc. In this example, the building was not deemed usable for eight months, until exposures began
to approach pre-abatement levels.

EPA's asbestos National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) require that asbestos be lowered
to specified levels (although not as low as pre-abatement levels) before certain buildings can be reoccupied. These
requirements have been built into many asbestos abatement contracts for liability reasons. OSHA calculated, as
a hypothetical example, that if reoccupation of portions of 5,000 office buildings, with an annual rental value of
$100,000 each, were delayed for 6 months in order for asbestos levels to settle, there would be a deadweight economic
loss of $250 million to building owners and society.

Asbestos liability savings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the section on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
REGULATORY AND NON-REGULATORY ALTERNATIVES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, asbestos liability has become a major area of tort litigation. Roughly $8 billion has been spent on asbestos litigation
in the last decade [Wall Street Journal, 1992; OSHA, 1986]. The dollar amount of awards has exploded in the last decade.
Industry observers forecast that up to $80 billion will be spent on asbestos abatement over the next 20 years, largely
as a result of a fear of lawsuits [Wall Street Journal, 1992]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building owners commission asbestos removal in an attempt to eliminate, or at least reduce, the probability of future
lawsuits. Although the likelihood of future lawsuits is uncertain, building owners presumably calculate that the
``expected'' cost of such lawsuits would run over $4 billion a year, on average (using the 20-year forecast given above).
If an individual building owner spends $50,000 to remove the asbestos from a building to avert potential future lawsuits,
the owner may be implicitly calculating that such an expenditure will effectively eliminate a 5 percent chance that
the owner will have to pay out over $1 million in a lawsuit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unfortunately, the evidence suggests that such attempts to reduce the probability of lawsuits, in the absence of
proper protections, may be in vain. As discussed elsewhere in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
BENEFITS 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section, recent evidence suggests that such removal attempts, in the absence of proper protections, may actually

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
increase 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
building occupants' exposure to asbestos. Ultimately, exposure to asbestos is the impetus for lawsuits. While it
might be arguable, from an exposure standpoint, that the building owner's most economical choice would be to encapsulate
existing asbestos, the path of minimizing liability is driving many building owners to actually remove the asbestos.
It appears that successful avoidance of liability is guaranteed only by taking all feasible measures to minimize
exposures to occupants during removal. Thus, spending an additional $5,000 for worker health to complete a $50,000
removal operation could ultimately prevent a $1 million lawsuit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This analysis suggests, then, that the asbestos standard's requirements for engineering controls and work practices,
including the use of negative pressure enclosures and other isolation efforts, if successful in averting lawsuits,
would have a market value of upwards of $4 billion a year (the minimum value of averting lawsuits). Note that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
there need not actually be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
over $4 billion a year in lawsuits; the market behavior of owners willing to pay for asbestos abatement simply reflects
the market value to those owners of minimizing the likelihood of lawsuits, in effect acting as a type of insurance policy.
Moreover, as discussed above, it is not necessary that such efforts be 100 percent successful in preventing lawsuits_the
estimated effectiveness in reducing the probability or value of potential lawsuits possesses considerable value.
Additionally, it is not necessary that such controls dramatically reduce exposures to building occupants, although
OSHA's analysis indicates that they will, as long as it is established that all feasible measures were taken to minimize
asbestos exposures to building occupants so that owner negligence cannot be the grounds of a lawsuit. If instituting
the asbestos controls mandated by the OSHA standard were only marginally effective in reducing the probability of
lawsuits, say by 10 percent, the use of these preventative measures would still possess a value of over $400 million.

Finally, asbestos removal efforts reflect concern over liability claims from building occupants, and perhaps custodians
and maintenance personnel. It does not include the value of prevented claims from workers who must remove the asbestos.
The revised asbestos standard 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
eliminates significant risk to the extent feasible,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as defined by law, and thereby minimizes secondary liability created by attempts to minimize primary liability.

E. Technological Feasibility and Compliance Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section examines the technological feasibility and estimated costs of compliance for the final revised asbestos
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Technological Feasibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General industry.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSHA's 1986 Regulatory Impact Analysis [OSHA, 1986] described in detail the controls that would be necessary in order
to achieve a PEL of 0.2 f/cc in each of the affected sectors in general industry. OSHA determined that compliance with
the 0.2 f/cc PEL was feasible through the use of wet methods, engineering controls, and housekeeping practices. In
addition, for the following operations compliance with the PEL of 0.2 f/cc was generally not achievable without the
use of respirators: the dry mechanical process in A/C pipe manufacturing and the dry mechanical, wet mechanical,
and nuclear ripout processes in ship repair. Compliance with the 1.0 f/cc excursion limit promulgated in the 1988
rulemaking was also expected to lead to occasional respirator use in high-exposure activities throughout primary
and secondary manufacturing [OSHA, 1988]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the revised PEL of 0.1 f/cc, some manufacturing operations will need to supplement engineering controls and work
practices with respiratory protection. In all, 2,345 workers (or less than 1 percent of the 682,685 workers exposed
in all affected industry sectors) in general industry are expected to need respirators at least part of the workday
in order to maintain exposures below the revised PEL. Since all affected employers in general industry will be able
to comply with the proposed PEL through the use of engineering controls or, where necessary, respirators, OSHA concludes
that the proposed PEL is technologically feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to respirators, ancillary controls will also be needed in affected industry/process groups as a result
of the lowering of the PEL. These controls include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Regulated areas; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Disposable protective clothing and gloves; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Changerooms and lockers;

&bull;Shower rooms; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Lunch areas; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Annual update of the written compliance program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All ancillary controls required by the revised general industry standard are currently in extensive use throughout
industry and are therefore technologically feasible.

Paragraph (k)(7) Care of asbestos-containing flooring material, prohibits for the first time, sanding and high-speed
(greater than 300 RPM) stripping of floor material. This new housekeeping paragraph also requires that burnishing
and dry buffing of asbestos-containing flooring be performed only when a finish on the flooring is sufficient to prevent
contact with ACM. Evidence from the record indicates that many building maintenance personnel are currently meeting
these requirements (Tr. 2/7/91 at 4256&hyph;4270, Ex. 7&hyph;91). Therefore, new Paragraph (k)(7) is technologically
feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, the final revision to the current standard requires certain engineering controls and work practices for
brake and clutch repair and services. These requirements include the mandatory use of a negative pressure enclosure/HEPA
vacuum method, a low pressure/wet cleaning method, or an alternate method capable of reducing exposure levels to
or below levels achieved by the enclosure/HEPA vacuum method. Brake shops performing fewer than six brake or clutch
repair jobs per week are permitted to use Method [D] Wet Methods in revised Appendix F of 1910.1001. According to the
National Automobile Dealers Association, both the enclosure/HEPA vacuum method and the low pressure/wet cleaning
method are currently in use throughout the automotive brake and clutch repair industry (Ex. 7&hyph;104); therefore,
the revised control requirements for brake and clutch repair are judged by OSHA to be technological feasible.

Construction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The evaluation of technological feasibility in construction focused on the various combinations of engineering
controls, work practices, and respiratory protection necessary to reduce current exposures to achieve compliance
with the final PEL of 0.1 f/cc. In addition, OSHA examined a number of engineering controls, work practices, and ancillary
requirements which will directly and indirectly contribute to reducing employee exposures. Exposures to asbestos
in the construction industry were classified into six activity categories:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Asbestos abatement

falls under asbestos work Classes I and III as defined in the revised standard.

Demolition
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

_including drywall demolition involving the removal of pipe and boiler insulation, fireproofing, drywall tape
and spackling, acoustical plasters, transite panels, built-up roofing and flooring products. Renovation and remodeling
generally involve contact with generic building materials and would therefore fall under asbestos work Class II
as defined in the revised standard.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
_including maintenance and repair activities involving disturbance of asbestos materials and products (for example,
repair of leaking steam pipes, ceiling tiles, roofing, drywall, or flooring; or adjustment of HVAC equipment above
suspended ceilings). Routine maintenance falls under Class III asbestos work as defined in the revised standard
when asbestos-containing materials (ACM) are disturbed during the maintenance activity; and under Class IV asbestos
work as defined in the revised standard when maintenance involves minor, incidental contact with ACM.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Custodial Work
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
To support the regulatory impact analysis for the 1986 asbestos standard, CONSAD derived baseline exposure levels
for each construction activity from a database that included personal and area air samples, OSHA inspection reports,
expert testimony, and various published reports [CONSAD, 1990]. The technological feasibility assessments for
this final revised standard were influenced by expected exposure reduction following the promulgation of the 1986
asbestos standard, and by a review of the literature, including submittals to the OSHA docket (H&hyph;033e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA determined in 1986 that, for a variety of construction activities, it was feasible to reach the current PEL of
0.2 f/cc through the use of available engineering controls and work practices (i.e., without the need for respiratory
protection). These construction activities included:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the remaining activities, respiratory protection was necessary in order to reach the current PEL of 0.2 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
f/cc. OSHA assumed that employers would choose the most cost-effective approach and supply their workers with half-mask
supplied-air respirators (or full-facepiece supplied-air respirators for asbestos removal projects) in order
to eliminate the need for exposure monitoring [OSHA, 1986]. Thus, in the 1986 RIA, OSHA assumed that workers in many
higher-risk construction activities would be provided supplied-air respirators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA now believes that the prior analytical assumption of widespread use of supplied-air respirators may not be consistent
with field experience. OSHA believes that supplied-air respirators are used in many construction activities_particularly
removal and demolition, where exposures tend to be highest. For other construction activities where peak exposures
are generally lower and episodic, many abatement and maintenance personnel appear to be complying with the current
standard using a combination of engineering controls, work practices and lighter respirators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Construction employers also appear to meet the requirements for daily monitoring (1926.58(f)(3) in the current
standard) by compiling historical exposure data documenting compliance with the current OSHA PEL during representative
projects. OSHA anticipates that some construction employers will meet the requirements of revised Paragraph (f)
Exposure assessments and monitoring, through the use of selective initial monitoring to establish an historical
exposure data record, which can form the basis for achieving all necessary requirements of the standard. Where exposures
may exceed levels documented by objective data, additional respiratory protection may be necessary, and is judged
by OSHA to be technologically feasible based on field experience and information in the rulemaking record [Corn,
1992; HEI&hyph;AR, 1992]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the standard for general industry, OSHA is proposing the prohibition of high-speed sanding and the use of highly
abrasive pads during asbestos floor tile work. In CONSAD's 1985 study [CONSAD 1985] and in OSHA's 1986 RIA [OSHA, 1986],
exposures during floor tile installation, removal, and sanding were reported to be generally below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.2 f/cc when the recommendations of the Resilient Floor Covering Institute were followed. These recommended practices
included wet sweeping and handling, and the prohibition of power sanding and blowing asbestos dust. OSHA estimated
current exposures in floor repair at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.024 f/cc under the assumption that the Institute's recommended practices have been adopted by a majority of establishments.
Therefore, the prohibition of high-speed sanding in the current proposal is not expected to significantly affect
floor repair. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the final PEL of 0.1 f/cc, additional respiratory protection may be necessary. Specifically, some projects
involving A/C pipe installation, A/C sheet installation, floor removal, floor repair, large-scale gasket removal,
pipe repair, and custodial work in industrial, commercial and residential buildings would require the use of half-mask
respirators to meet the revised PEL. In addition, drywall demolition projects may need to upgrade their respiratory
protection to full-facepiece negative-pressure respirators to meet the lower permissible exposure limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessing current respirator usage and predicted demand under the revised standard, OSHA concludes that nearly
all construction activities will require respiratory protection during at least part of the project-day in order
to comply with the 0.1 f/cc PEL. Based on the lower-bound exposure estimates provided in the literature and reported
in CONSAD [CONSAD, 1990, 1985], it appears that a variety of routine maintenance activities and some abatement jobs
may be able to achieve the proposed PEL of 0.1 f/cc without respirators. From its analysis of current exposures, OSHA
anticipates that only in small-scale gasket removal and installation will respiratory protection not be necessary
for most project-days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other incremental controls necessary to comply with OSHA's final asbestos standard, include (depending upon
the construction activity):

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on information in the record and in OSHA's inspection files, OSHA observes that many construction employers
currently apply these controls in varied combinations and at varied levels of utilization. OSHA estimated that for
construction employers, rates of current compliance range from roughly 20 percent to 80 percent, depending on the
control requirement and construction activity. Therefore, OSHA believes all controls are technologically feasible
for the appropriate construction activities. In conclusion, therefore, OSHA projects that the final revisions
to the asbestos construction standard will be technologically feasible because all of the provisions, including
the lowered PEL, can be met using existing engineering controls, respiratory protection and work practices.

Shipyards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Historically, exposure to asbestos in shipyards took place during shipbuilding and ship repair. At present, the
majority of asbestos activity aboard maritime vessels involves repair and maintenance of machinery and plumbing
with asbestos insulation. In this final rulemaking, the revised asbestos standard for shipyards, &sect;1915.1001,
applies most of the requirements given in the revised asbestos construction standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the two main shipyard activities affected by the revised asbestos standard_wet removal/repair and dry removal/repair_comment
in the record [Ex. 7&hyph;77, Ex. 7&hyph;85] suggests that employers are able to achieve the revised PEL of 0.1 f/cc
through the use of engineering controls and, where necessary, respiratory protection. The OSHA Shipyard Employment
Standards Advisory Committee [Ex. 7&hyph;77] commented that on many shipyard projects, exposure levels have been
reduced to levels considerably below the revised PEL. Moreover, to a large extent employers appear to be currently
applying the ancillary controls and work practices required in the revised construction standard (and applied to
the revised shipyard standard) [Ex. 9&hyph;23]. Therefore, on the basis of evidence in the record, OSHA believes
the revised shipyard standard is technologically feasible.

and shipyards. OSHA's cost assumptions and methodologies are based upon an OSHA/CONSAD technical analysis of the
final rule [OSHA, 1994]; OSHA's PRIA [OSHA, 1990]; CONSAD's final report supporting the PRIA [1990]; the rulemaking
record; and previous regulatory analyses performed by OSHA [OSHA, 1986], CONSAD [CONSAD, 1985] and Research Triangle
Institute [RTI, 1985]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cost data for control mechanisms were obtained from published price lists of equipment suppliers and from other information
collected by OSHA and CONSAD. Wage data were taken from the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics'

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Employment Cost Indexes and Levels
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (BLS, 1993b). Unit costs are expressed, as appropriate, on a per-establishment, -crew, -project, -worker, project-day,
and worker-day basis, using industry profile data presented in the OSHA/CONSAD technical analysis [OSHA, 1994]
and in CONSAD's prior analyses [CONSAD, 1990, 1985]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To derive estimates of the annual incremental compliance costs for the revised asbestos standard, the estimated
unit cost factors for the controls were multiplied by the estimated number of required control resources. In order
to develop net annual compliance cost estimates, these gross annual cost estimates were then adjusted using estimates
of current application of controls. Costs were estimated on an annual basis, with total annual costs calculated as
the sum of annualized initial costs and annual recurring costs. Initial costs were annualized over the service life
of the equipment or administrative activity, at a discount rate of 10 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The section below presents the estimated costs to general industry, followed by the costs to construction and to shipyards.

General industry. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing the annual compliance cost estimates for general industry, unit cost estimates were first developed
for each of the control practices and ancillary measures required by the revised standard for each of the industry/process
groups affected by the proposed standard. The annual compliance costs for each affected industry/process group
were then computed by combining the unit cost data with the number of units of each type of control practice needed per
year to achieve compliance with OSHA's proposed standard. Compliance costs were also adjusted to reflect current
compliance with the required control practices.

Manufacturing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The industry/process groups in manufacturing with exposures above the revised PEL of 0.1 f/cc will require the implementation
of a set of uniform control practices, including written compliance programs, regulated areas, respirators (including
the respirator unit, accessories, fit testing and cleaning), disposable protective clothing and gloves, change
rooms and lockers, shower rooms, and lunch rooms. Other controls, while necessary for compliance with the revised
standard, are also required by the current asbestos standard and, thus, will not create an incremental burden. Controls
assumed by OSHA to be currently in place include periodic monitoring; prescribed methods of compliance; employee
information and training; medical surveillance; and recordkeeping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised asbestos standard for general industry imposes new communication requirements for building and facility
owners. In particular, under Paragraph (j)(2)(ii), owners are required to maintain records of information concerning
the presence, location and quantity of asbestos-containing material (ACM) and presumed asbestos-containing material
(PACM). Under Paragraph (j)(2)(iii), owners of buildings and facilities are required to inform employers of employees
who perform housekeeping activities in the presence of ACM or PACM of the presence and location of the ACM or PACM in
the area. In this regulatory analysis OSHA treats housekeeping and custodial activities in general industry as construction
activities. OSHA's estimated compliance costs for information requirements pertaining to housekeeping/custodial
activities are discussed below in the section on compliance costs for the revised construction standard.

Brake and clutch repair. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As in the existing OSHA asbestos standard for general industry, automotive repair work is regulated in revised &sect;1910.1001.
In Paragraph (f)(3) employers performing six or more brake or clutch jobs per week are required to use a negative pressure
enclosure/HEPA vacuum method, a low pressure/wet cleaning method, or an alternate method proven to achieve results
equivalent to those for the enclosure/HEPA vacuum method. OSHA assessed the extent to which control practices are
being applied during brake and clutch repair in the automotive services industry and identified the additional resources
needed to reach full compliance with the revised standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on OSHA's and CONSAD's assessment of current industry practice, OSHA believes that only a small fraction of
auto repair shops perform fewer than six brake or clutch inspections per week [OSHA, 1994]. Thus, OSHA anticipates
that few shops will qualify for the exemption from engineering controls mandated in revised Appendix F. OSHA and CONSAD
[OSHA, 1994] estimate that 65 percent of brake shops currently use wet methods and solvent spray systems during brake
and clutch work. Under the revised standard, these shops would have to switch to one of the fiber control methods permitted
in Appendix F. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this cost analysis, OSHA assumed most of the shops currently not in compliance with the revised rule, will adopt
the low pressure/wet cleaning method as the least expensive option permitted in the revised standard. OSHA estimates
that incremental expenditures for equipment, supplies and labor time will total $11.2 million per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment in the record [Ex. L162&hyph;61] points to the potential for substantial cost offsets from use of the low pressure/wet
cleaning method. These cost offsets include the reduced need for solvent; reductions in costs associated with housekeeping
and with laundering and disposal of contaminated rags and other articles; and improved operating efficiencies.
Because of potential cost savings, use of the low pressure/wet cleaning method has grown in recent years. Moreover,
concern over the effect of 1&hyph;1&hyph;1 trichloroethane on the ozone layer has led to a phase-out of the solvent,
forcing brake shops to discontinue use of the solvent spray method. Of concern to occupational health specialists
is the regular use of solvents among a workforce with minimal protection from exposures. In sum, OSHA believes that
cost offsets and environmental and health concerns combine to mitigate the direct costs facing brake shops who must
switch to alternative asbestos control systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Current work practices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to work practices in automotive services that meet the revised standard, certain work practices that
were required by OSHA's previous standard with a PEL of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.0 f/cc, and are required by the current standard, as well as by the proposed revisions to the current standard (e.g.
wet handling and the collection, disposal, and labeling of wastes in sealed, impermeable bags), are also not identified
as additional costs. OSHA believes that wet methods (to the extent that they are feasible), and the use of HEPA vacuums
for housekeeping in primary and secondary manufacturing, are already widely in use.

Total costs for general industry. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To derive estimates of the annual incremental compliance costs for the industry/process groups affected by the revised
general industry standard, the estimated unit cost factors were first multiplied by estimates of the resources necessary
to achieve compliance for that industry/process group. These gross annual cost estimates were then adjusted to account
for current compliance rates which were first projected in the 1986 RIA [OSHA, 1986] and were modified as a result of
compliance with the excursion limit rule in 1988 [OSHA, 1988] and evidence from the rulemaking record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each of the manufacturing processes in the affected industries, CONSAD estimated the number of plants with exposures
above the revised PEL of 0.1 f/cc (the number of plants needing controls), the number of processes to be controlled,
the number of work stations to be controlled, the number of workers directly exposed, worker-days of exposure per
year, and the direct worker-hours of exposure per year. These estimates are based on: the number of establishments
in each industry sector, determined by CONSAD from information presented in EPA's ban and phase-out rule [ICF, 1988],
and from contacts with industry experts; the percentage of processes within plants with exposures above the proposed
PEL of 0.1 f/cc and requiring controls; and finally, characteristics concerning the number of processes per plant,
work stations per process, workers per work station, and the frequency and duration of each process in these affected
industries. The resource estimates used to develop annual compliance costs are developed in detail in [CONSAD, 1990,
Table 3.11]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on OSHA and CONSAD's analysis [OSHA, 1994; CONSAD, 1990], OSHA estimates that annual costs of compliance in
general industry will total $14.8 million. Table 7 presents compliance costs by control practice, for each industry
process, for the industry sector as a whole, and for all of general industry. Examining compliance costs by sector,
it can be seen that the largest compliance expenditures will be in auto repair ($11.2 million), followed by friction
materials ($2.2 million) and coatings and sealants ($1.2 million).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Comparing costs per provision along the bottom row of the table, incremental costs for engineering controls in auto
repair represent the leading expenditure. Other controls bearing significant costs are half-mask respirators
($1.4 million), disposable protective clothing and gloves ($1.1 million), change rooms and lockers ($563 thousand),
and shower rooms ($418 thousand). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For secondary manufacture of gaskets and packings and secondary auto remanufacturing, where exposures currently
are below the revised PEL, OSHA anticipates little or no incremental costs. Therefore, impacts on establishments
in these industry groups will be insignificant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Construction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within the construction industry, 24 unique activities will come under the scope of the proposed revision. These
construction activities are found in new construction, asbestos abatement and building demolition, general building
renovation and remodeling, and routine facility maintenance and custodial work in public, commercial, and residential
buildings and in general industry. Although the construction activities under consideration in this study will
require the implementation of different control practices and/or combinations of these practices, the basic characteristics
of available control practices are relatively uniform, and the options for combining control practices in the construction
industry and during routine maintenance and repair activities in general industry are limited in number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain work practices that have been required since OSHA's earlier asbestos standards (e.g., wet handling and the
collection and disposal of waste in sealed, impermeable bags) are not included as cost elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each major provision of the revised construction standard, below, OSHA presents cost estimates by type of engineering
or administrative control, work practice or personal protective equipment, where appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(c) Permissible exposure limits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The revised asbestos construction standard lowers the permissible exposure limit from 0.2 fiber per cubic centimeter
to 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air as an eight-hour time-weighted average. The revised standard retains the
current excursion limit of 1.0 fiber per cubic centimeter of air as averaged over a sampling period of thirty minutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing both (1) the literature on risk to asbestos in the construction industry and (2) the earlier OSHA rulemaking
record (Docket H&hyph;033c), CONSAD [CONSAD, 1990, Table 2.8] reported representative exposure levels by construction
activity that formed the basis of OSHA's risk estimates in the PRIA. CONSAD presented the range of exposure levels
in the absence of respiratory protection for each construction activity. From the raw exposure data, OSHA [1986,
1990] developed arithmetic mean estimates, against which the proposed PELs were compared. OSHA then assigned engineering
and respiratory controls as required and implied by the earlier rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this final regulatory impact analysis, OSHA adjusted CONSAD's baseline (pre-1986) exposure levels to reflect
likely controls applied since OSHA promulgated final asbestos rules in 1986 and 1988. In adjusting exposures from
baseline levels, OSHA attempted to represent realistic reductions in fiber levels under a regulatory regime consisting
of a 0.2 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
f/cc eight-hour PEL, a 0.1 f/cc eight-hour action level, a 1.0 f/cc thirty-minute excursion level, and ancillary
controls and procedures. OSHA's adjusted baseline exposures were presented in Section D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's revised PEL is expected to lead to wider use of respirators in construction. In particular, OSHA anticipates
increased usage of half-mask and full-face cartridge respirators as a result of the revised PEL. For some activities
where 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
average
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exposures are projected to be below the PEL due to the use of engineering controls and work practices, respirators
may be necessary where peak exposures occur. OSHA conservatively applied half-mask cartridge respirators, with
a protection factor of 10, where peak exposures can exceed ten times the revised PEL; OSHA applied full-facepiece
cartridge respirators for activities where peak exposures can exceed 50 times the revised PEL. In all, annual respirator
costs will total $24.9 million. Included in this total cost are expenditures for the respirator unit, accessories,
filters, training (costs assigned under Paragraph (k) Communication of hazards), cleaning and fit testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(d) Multi-employer worksites.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Revised Paragraph (d) expands upon the current requirement that an employer performing asbestos work in a regulated
area inform other employers on the site of the nature of the employer's work with asbestos and the existence of, and
rules pertaining to, regulated areas. In addition, Paragraph (d) requires
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Abatement of asbestos hazards by the contractor controlling the source of the contamination_(d)(2)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Protection of employees adjacent to asbestos worksite_(d)(3)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Daily assessment by adjacent employers of integrity of enclosures or effectiveness of other control methods
relied on by the primary asbestos contractor_(d)(4)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Supervisory authority by general contractors over the work of the asbestos contractor on the asbestos worksite_(d)(5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA anticipates significant compliance costs for three of the four additional requirements in the revised paragraph
on multi-employer worksites. For provisions (d)(2) and (d)(3), OSHA believes that compliance with the requirements
for PELs [Paragraph (c)] and initial exposure assessment [Paragraph (j)] will ensure compliance with these areas.
Regarding daily assessment of work areas, required by (d)(4), OSHA considers these duties to fall under the supervision
of competent persons. Compliance costs for competent persons are discussed below under Paragraph (o).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Paragraph (d)(5), OSHA assumes that after promulgation of the revised standard, asbestos contractors will achieve
full compliance and, therefore, that general contractors will rarely need to exercise authority over employee protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(e) Regulated areas.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (e) specifies the controls required for construction activities designated as regulated areas. OSHA
anticipates incremental costs for all construction work defined in the revised standard as Class I, II or III. Incremental
costs for regulated areas will stem from the need for caution and warning signs and caution tape at the perimeter of
work areas, as required by (e)(2) Demarcation and (k)(6) Signs. OSHA anticipates total costs of $15.8 million for
caution and warning signs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(f) Exposure assessments and monitoring.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Revised Paragraph (f) alters current requirements for initial exposure monitoring, periodic monitoring, termination
of monitoring, additional monitoring, employee notification of sampling results, and observation of monitoring.
OSHA anticipates that following promulgation of this revised standard, many employers will initially monitor higher-risk
sites_under conditions of full application of controls_in order to establish compliance with the revised PEL of
0.1 f/cc. Results from initial monitoring can be used as historical, objective data for compliance purposes, consistent
with revised (f)(1)(iii) Negative initial exposure assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To estimate monitoring costs in construction, OSHA assumed_for activities where objective data has not been established_that
employers conducting Class I, II or III work, will purchase monitoring equipment, train a supervisor to conduct monitoring,
and have three representative exposure samples analyzed by a laboratory. OSHA assumed that employers conducting
Class IV activities will hire an outside industrial hygiene technician to monitor workers and collect three exposure
samples. Basing cost analysis on these assumptions, OSHA projects total incremental compliance costs of $40.1 million
for exposure monitoring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(g) Methods of Compliance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In revised Paragraph (g) Methods of compliance, OSHA has significantly expanded the structure and content of the
regulatory text in the current standard. Revised Paragraph (g) prescribes specific engineering controls and work
practices for each of the four asbestos construction classes defined in the standard. To satisfy the requirements
for ancillary controls, employers are expected to purchase or otherwise adopt the following types of controls and
practices: HEPA vacuum/ventilation systems; HEPA vacuums; wet methods; airtight (negative-pressure) regulated
areas; drop cloths; mini enclosures; critical barriers; and glove bag systems (with HEPA vacuums). Included in the
cost of each control are expenditures for basic equipment, accessories, construction supplies (for barriers and
enclosures), smoke testers (for negative-pressure enclosures), and incremental labor resources needed to implement
the control, to smoke test (where necessary) and to disassemble the control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Incremental compliance costs associated with engineering controls and work practices are anticipated for all construction
activities affected by the revised standard. The combination of controls vary by activity, depending on current
exposure levels, the extent of current compliance assumed by OSHA, and the construction class (as defined in the revised
standard) for the work activity. OSHA projects the following annual compliance costs for methods of compliance:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HEPA vacuum/ventilation systems_$15.3 million
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(h) Respiratory protection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Revised Paragraph (h) mandates the use of respirators under particular circumstances during asbestos construction
work. As prescribed in the standard, respirators must be worn (1) during all Class I work; (2) during all Class III work
when TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM is being disturbed; (3) during all Class II and III asbestos jobs where wet methods
are not used or where insufficient or inadequate data prevents development of a negative exposure assessment; or
(4) in emergencies. For this final regulatory impact analysis, OSHA identified an additional need for respirators
in new construction, during removal and repair of flooring products, during routine maintenance in general industry,
and during custodial work in industrial, commercial and residential buildings. Respirators were assigned to construction
activities where baseline exposure ranges suggested workers would occasionally exceed the revised PEL. Incremental
compliance costs for respirators were presented above under (c) Permissible exposure limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(i) Protective clothing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (i) in this final rulemaking has been revised such that protective clothing will be required for all Class
I activities and in Class III activities where thermal system insulation or surfacing ACM/PACM is being disturbed
in which a negative exposure assessment has not been produced, in addition to the requirement that clothing be worn
when the PEL or excursion limit (EL) is exceeded. OSHA anticipates an additional need for protective clothing in the
following construction activities where workers may occasionally exceed the PEL:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A/C pipe installation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A/C sheet installation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Repair flooring
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Custodial work in industrial buildings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Custodial work in public, commercial and residential buildings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA assumes that to provide protective clothing to employees as required by the standard, employers will minimize
costs by providing to each employee one set of disposable clothing and gloves for each worker-day. For disposal, clothing
can be combined with other contaminated waste and sealed in impermeable bags. Summing incremental costs for protective
disposable clothing, OSHA estimates total costs of $17.9 million associated with revised Paragraph (i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(j) Hygiene facilities and practices for employees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Revised Paragraph (j) provides for decontamination areas, equipment rooms, showers, change rooms, and lunch areas
for Class I activities. Class II and Class III activities may conduct decontamination in adjacent areas on impermeable
drop cloths, with clothing and equipment cleaned with HEPA vacuums. Decontamination following Class IV activities
must be at least as stringent as required for the class of activity within which the Class IV work is being performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA anticipates that Class I hygiene requirements will apply for the first time to boiler repair, pipe repair and
miscellaneous maintenance in general industry. Annual compliance costs will total $5.5 million for equipment and
labor involved with the hygiene facilities in Class I work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employers can decontaminate Class II and Class III work using drop cloths and HEPA vacuums, controls required under
(g) Methods of compliance. OSHA's estimated costs for drop cloths and HEPA vacuums were presented above in the discussion
of revised Paragraph (g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA assumes that decontamination following Class IV work conducted in regulated areas will be provided by the primary
contractor at the job site. Costs for decontamination of Class IV employees, then would be captured by the total decontamination
costs for the activity in the regulated area. In addition, OSHA assumed that drop cloths and HEPA vacuums will be needed
by custodians following higher-risk activities outside regulated areas. Costs for drop cloths and HEPA vacuums
were presented under (g) Methods of compliance, above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(k) Communication of hazards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Revised Paragraph (k) supplements the existing hazard-communication requirements in the asbestos standard by
introducing provisions for notification of building and facility owners, contractors, employees and building
occupants of the presence, location and quantity of asbestos-containing material (ACM) or presumed asbestos-containing
material (PACM). The final revisions to (k) also include training requirements that mirror the training required
under the EPA ASHARA legislation, for employees working around ACM or PACM. Training required under revised Paragraph
(k) appears to strengthen the content of training required under existing (k) by explicitly referencing the EPA Model
Accreditation Plan (MAP) and Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) worker protection training.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For this final regulatory impact analysis, OSHA identified incremental compliance costs for employee training
and notifications involving building/facility owners, construction employers, construction employees, and
building occupants. For the purpose of cost estimation, OSHA categorized employee training into three groups: (1)
Classes I and II, (2) Class III, and (3) Class IV.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For each of the three categories of training required by the revised standard, OSHA estimated compliance costs as

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To estimate compliance costs of the new notification requirements in revised Paragraph (k), OSHA identified seven
unique types of notifications. OSHA assumed that notification among affected parties could involve memos, phone
calls, notices or other lower-cost means of communication, ranging in labor time from three to five minutes per project.
The types of notifications are given below, along with OSHA's estimated total annual compliance cost.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to requirements for notification, Paragraph (k)(2)(iii) requires owners to maintain records of all
information indicating the presence, location and quantity of ACM and PACM in the building. OSHA estimated recordkeeping
costs of $9.7 million to comply with revised (k).

(l) Housekeeping.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (l) is expanded in this final revision to the asbestos construction standard to include a section on care
of asbestos-containing flooring material. Included in the new section are a prohibition on sanding of asbestos-containing
material; work practices specifying wet methods for floor stripping and adequate floor finish for burnishing and
dry buffing; and a requirement that dusting and dry sweeping be performed with HEPA vacuums. OSHA anticipates incremental
compliance costs associated with using wet methods and HEPA vacuums during housekeeping duties. Costs for the use
of wet methods during custodial work is included in the total costs for wet methods given under (g), above, and are expected
to be $55.2 million. Costs for the use of HEPA vacuums during custodial work is included in the total costs for HEPA vacuums
given under (g), above, and are expected to be $32.5 million.

(m) Medical surveillance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Revised Paragraph (m) provides that medical exams be given for all employees whose exposures exceed the PEL or excursion
limit for 30 or more days per year, or who are required by the standard to wear negative pressure respirators. For this
final RIA, OSHA recognized the extent to which medical exams are currently provided to employees. Therefore, incremental
costs were estimated only for employees in those construction activities which previously did not qualify for medical
exams but which now appear to meet the qualifications. Activities qualifying for medical exams under the revised
standard include the following (along with estimated annual compliance costs):

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimated compliance costs for Paragraph (m) include costs for medical exams and for recordkeeping. In all, $10.1
million in annual costs for medical surveillance are expected for affected construction activities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(n) Recordkeeping.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Revised Paragraph (n) requires that employers establish and maintain records of objective data (in compliance with
(f)), exposure measurements, medical surveillance, and training. Revised Paragraph (n) also provides for availability
and transfer of records. Incremental recordkeeping costs for each of these areas were presented above.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(o) Competent person.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (o) is a new section of the construction standard and provides for competent person training and supervision
for Class I, II, and III activities. Consistent with the distinctions among activity classes in (o), OSHA identified
two levels of competent person training: Class I/II and Class III. OSHA estimates that costs for annual Class I/II
competent person supervision will be $13.5 million; OSHA estimates annual costs of $6.0 million for Class III competent
person supervision. OSHA's estimates of competent person training costs are based on an analysis by EPA's contractor
Abt Associates [Abt, 1993], of the costs and benefits of the EPA Model Accreditation Plan regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to competent person supervision, the revised standard requires that the person evaluating compliance
methods that are alternatives to those in (g) Methods of compliance, be qualified as a project designer [(g)(6)(ii)].
OSHA estimated the costs for training project designers for Class I activities. At an annual cost of $171 thousand,
the training burden implied by this requirement is attributed to the EPA MAP regulation, which provides for training
of project designers and other competent persons.

Total construction costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Based on OSHA's preliminary regulatory impact analysis [OSHA, 1990], preliminary analysis by CONSAD [CONSAD, 1990],
and cost analysis of the revised standard by OSHA and CONSAD [OSHA, 1994], OSHA estimated total costs of compliance
with the revised PEL of 0.1 f/cc and the ancillary requirements pertaining to regulated areas, methods of compliance,
respiratory protection, hygiene facilities, communication of hazards and competent person training. The estimated
compliance costs, by control requirement, are shown in Table 8 for each major construction sector. OSHA's estimate
of total cost, $476.4 million, is the average cost for a range of construction workers potentially at risk in each of
the activities affected by the standard (see [CONSAD, 1990, Appendix A] and [OSHA, 1994]). This estimate of incremental
costs, however, includes the training costs_for workers, supervisors, project designers and competent persons_that
would otherwise be incurred through compliance with the EPA Model Accreditation Plan regulation. Excluding EPA-related
training costs, OSHA estimates that $346.5 million in incremental costs are attributed to the OSHA construction
standard. Table 9 presents total annual compliance costs by construction activity, for requirements unique to the
revised OSHA construction standard.

Shipyards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised standard for shipyards largely resembles the revised construction standard. OSHA and CONSAD [OSHA,
1994] identified two shipyard activities_wet removal/repair/installation and dry removal/repair/installation
aboard vessels_where significant contact with asbestos can take place. CONSAD's cost analysis assumes asbestos
removal will be performed by abatement specialists currently complying with requirements in the existing asbestos
general industry standard (under which asbestos contact during shipbuilding and repairing is presently regulated).
Specifically, abatement specialists in shipyards are believed to be currently using the following controls at near-100
percent level: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;HEPA vacuums 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Wet methods (where feasible) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Regulated areas with caution signs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Respirators (full-facepiece cartridge respirators and full-facepiece supplied-air respirators) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Disposable protective clothing and gloves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Decontamination units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Lunch areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Training (General Industry standard) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Exposure monitoring (daily) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Medical Exams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Written compliance plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For affected shipyards, OSHA's cost analysis assigned engineering controls and work practices required or implied
by the revised asbestos standard. OSHA anticipates incremental costs associated with airtight regulated areas;
drop cloths; critical barriers; glove bag systems; worker training and competent person training (Class I); initial
exposure monitoring and development of objective data; and notification requirements. In all, OSHA projects annual
incremental compliance costs of approximately $229 thousand for the shipbuilding and repairing sector. Of these
costs, $137 thousand are associated with training required by the EPA Model Accreditation Plan regulation mandated
by the ASHARA legislation. Therefore, net OSHA-related annual costs for ship repair under the revised asbestos standard
are expected to total approximately $93 thousand (after rounding). Compliance costs for ship repair are presented
in Table 10 by control requirements for affected shipboard activities.

Aggregate incremental compliance costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described above, OSHA estimated compliance costs associated with the revised asbestos standard for General Industry,
Construction and Shipyards. Total annual costs for each of the three main parts of the asbestos standard are as follows
(excluding EPA-related training costs): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;General Industry_$14.8 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Construction_$346.5 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Shipyards_$93 thousand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summing compliance costs across affected sectors, OSHA estimates that annual incremental compliance costs of $361.4
million will result following promulgation of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The next section applies these estimates of incremental compliance costs for an analysis of the economic impacts
of the revised asbestos standard.

Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA examined the impacts of compliance costs on payroll, sales and profits for firms in general industry, shipyards
and construction affected by the revision to the asbestos standard. OSHA's economic impact analysis is presented
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Data Sources and Methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA used a variety of financial indicators and sources of statistical data to assess the impacts on the affected industries.
Payroll data for primary manufacturing industries and real estate industries were taken from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
County Business Patterns, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

1987 Census of Construction, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
[Dept. of Commerce, 1990b]. Data on sales were obtained from Dun and Bradstreet's Marketing Information computer
database [Dun and Bradstreet, 1992a] for the following industry groups: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Primary asbestos manufacturing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Automotive repair; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Shipyards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Selected groups in general industry where the disturbance of asbestos during routine maintenance falls under
the construction standard;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selected real estate industries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data on net value of construction work (a statistic approximating the sales volume of construction firms) for the
construction sector were taken from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1987 Census of Construction 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
[Dept. of Commerce, 1990b]. OSHA derived pre-tax profit rates using Dun and Bradstreet post-tax return-on-sales
data from Dun's Insight computer database [Dun and Bradstreet, 1992b] and the 1987 tax code. Pre-tax profits were
calculated using a formula that contains the marginal corporate tax rates for 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Primary manufacturing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has determined that the following four industries in primary manufacturing would be affected by the revision
to the asbestos standard: SIC 3292, Friction Materials; SIC 3053, Gaskets and Packings; SIC 2952, Coatings and Sealants;
and SIC 3089, Plastics. OSHA has concluded that there will be no incremental costs for the secondary manufacturing
industries identified in the preliminary regulatory impact analysis because these manufacturers are believed
to have already achieved exposure reductions that bring them into compliance with OSHA's new PEL of 0.1 f/cc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA compared the incremental compliance costs anticipated for the four affected primary manufacturing industries
with three financial indicators: (1) Annual payroll per firm, (2) dollar value of sales per firm and (3) pre-tax profits
per firm. The comparison with annual payroll conveys the magnitude of compliance costs relative to labor costs. The
comparison with sales provides a measure of the extent to which prices would rise to maintain profit levels if a firm
is able to pass 100 percent of incremental costs forward to buyers. If firms, for competitive reasons, are unable to
pass costs forward and must instead absorb the full impact internally, pre-tax profits would be expected to fall.
The comparison with pre-tax profits thus illustrates the maximum financial impact if the firm absorbs 100 percent
of the incremental compliance costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 11 presents the estimated impact of compliance costs in relation to annual payroll, sales, and pre-tax profits
per plant in primary manufacturing. Compliance costs as a percentage of sales are modest, averaging 0.6 percent for
affected establishments in primary manufacturing (Column 7). However, as shown in Column 8 in the table, profit impacts
are relatively high for two sectors: friction materials (26.2 percent) and gaskets and packings (7.3 percent). For
reasons given below, OSHA believes that profit impacts will be minimized by the ability of firms to pass forward costs
to consumers. The small increases in product prices (less than 2 percent) necessary to cover the increased costs of
production would be unlikely to affect the demand for these products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As evidenced by the disappearance of domestic production of various asbestos-based product lines (e.g., A/C pipe
and A/C sheet) over the last several years and the dramatic reduction in the production of other products (e.g., asbestos-containing
plastics), many former producers and consumers of asbestos are increasingly substituting other materials for asbestos.
The market forces behind increased substitution appear to be related to legal issues, such as liability, and regulatory
concerns, such as the attempted Environmental Protection Agency asbestos ban, rather than strictly the effect of
product substitution. Even when asbestos-based products are much cheaper than non-asbestos-based products, demand
and supply are shifting away from asbestos-based products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Primary manufacturers appear to have the latitude to raise prices on their products in the short run, but may substitute
away from asbestos entirely in the long run. In the friction materials industry, substitute products can be difficult
to develop, suggesting a limited cross-elasticity of demand that permits costs to be fairly easily passed along to
consumers. For other industries, since the substitution of inputs generally occurs at the site of formerly asbestos-based
production, any incremental economic impacts from this rule should be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, OSHA also examined the impacts on small establishments in primary
manufacturing to determine if they would be adversely affected by the final standard. Using data for firms with 19
or fewer employees, OSHA compared compliance costs with annual payroll, sales, and pre-tax profits for affected
industries identified as containing small establishments. The affected industries include small firms producing
asbestos gaskets and packings in SIC 3053, Gaskets, Packing, and Sealing Devices and producing asbestos coatings
and sealants in SIC 2952, Asphalt Felts and Coatings. OSHA has determined that there are currently no small producers
of asbestos friction materials and asbestos plastics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small-firm impacts for primary manufacturing are shown in Table 11. Under a full cost-pass-through scenario, OSHA
projects that compliance costs would be 1.1 percent of sales for gaskets and packings and that compliance costs would
be 0.6 percent of sales for coatings and sealants. Costs as a percentage of pre-tax profits, shown in the last column
of Table 11, are significantly higher, suggesting that severe profit reductions could be felt by any small firms unable
to pass forward incremental compliance costs. However, as discussed above, OSHA believes these firms will be able
to pass along most of the costs of compliance by raising prices and will therefore suffer minimal economic impact.

Automotive repair.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Economic impacts in establishments performing automotive brake and clutch repair, presented in Table 12, are expected
to be minor as a result of compliance with the revised standard for general industry. As a percentage of sales, compliance
costs average 0.01 percent for industry overall and for affected small establishments. As for the worst-case financial
impact, compliance costs as a percentage of profits would average 0.21 percent for all of industry and would average
0.26 percent for small establishments. On the basis of these impact estimates, OSHA has therefore concluded that
overall impacts in automotive repair will be modest and that there will be no significant differential effect on small
businesses as a result of the final standard.

Ship repair.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The impacts of the revision to the asbestos standard on establishments involved in ship repair are expected to be minimal.
Table 13 shows that average price impacts would be 0.07 percent for all establishments and would be 0.1 percent for
small establishments if firms were able to charge increased operating costs to their customers, i.e., ship owners.
At the opposite extreme in terms of potential financial impact, compliance costs as a percentage of profits would
average 0.8 percent for firms of all sizes in ship repair and would average 1.2 percent for small firms in ship repair.
Thus, OSHA has concluded that there will be no significant differential effect on small businesses involved in ship
repair as a result of the final standard.

Impacts in the Construction Industry. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA estimated economic impacts in construction using three economic impact measures, calculated for each affected
industry group. The first measure is the ratio of the average annual compliance cost per affected establishment (or
per exposed construction worker) to an estimate of the average payroll per establishment (or per construction worker).
As explained above, this measure compares the projected compliance costs to labor costs normally incurred by the
establishment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second impact measure is the ratio of the average annual compliance cost per affected establishment (or per exposed
construction worker) to an estimate of the net dollar value of construction work or sales for an average establishment
(or per construction worker). This ratio indicates the relationship of the compliance costs to an establishment
or worker's output and indicates the maximum impact on prices assuming 100 percent pass-through of the compliance
costs to the consumer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third economic impact statistic calculated by OSHA for construction measures the effect of compliance costs
on profits. Profit impacts were calculated at the industry level by dividing into compliance costs per establishment,
the estimated pre-tax profit per establishment. This index reveals the maximum potential impact on profits under
the assumption that compliance costs are fully absorbed by the affected firm. Profit impacts are particularly meaningful
when establishments face highly-competitive conditions which prevent the pass-through of compliance costs to
customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual incremental compliance costs per construction firm were estimated using the costs presented above for new
construction; asbestos abatement and demolition; general building renovation; routine maintenance in public,
commercial, and residential buildings; and custodial work in public, commercial, residential, and industrial
buildings (routine maintenance in industrial facilities is analyzed separately below). Table 14 presents average
per-worker and per-firm costs and impacts for all affected construction sectors. Table 15 shows estimated costs
and impacts for small establishments in affected construction sectors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Based on OSHA and CONSAD's estimates of the number of affected firms, crews, and workers performing each construction
activity and the number of projects conducted by each firm in a year [OSHA, 1994], annual costs for establishments
of average size are expected to range from $190 per building for SIC 6512, Operators of Nonresidential Buildings to
$2,283 per firm in SIC 1752, Floor Laying and Other Floor Work, Not Elsewhere Classified.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As shown in Table 14, costs as a percentage of payroll, sales, and profits are generally low on both a per-worker and
per-establishment basis when averaged across a range of firms in affected industries. Costs as a percentage of sales
per establishment average 0.13 percent and do not exceed 0.6 percent in any industry. For the impact scenario where
cost pass-through is not possible, OSHA projects that profit reductions would average 2.4 percent and would be below
5 percent for all but one industry, floor laying and floor work. For flooring contractors in SIC 1752, profit impacts
could exceed 9 percent if employers were forced to fully absorb compliance costs out of retained revenues and were
not able to pass costs forward. OSHA believes, however, that profit impacts will not be as severe as depicted in this
worst-case scenario, for two reasons.

Compliance costs for firms in SICs 6512 and 6513 were estimated on a per-building basis, rather than a per-firm basis,
due to insufficient data on numbers of buildings owned per firm in these industry groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, it appears that there are few services that compete with floor maintenance directly, and therefore demand
for services provided by the industry is relatively inelastic. Secondly, all floor-laying establishments are treated
uniformly by the revised standard. Because no individual firm faces unfair regulatory treatment by the revised standard,
cost impacts are expected across the majority of industry. Consequently, most affected firms should be able to pass
forward costs to customers without significant redistribution of market share. As indicated in Table 14, cost impacts
on prices (sales) would be minimal under a full cost-pass-through scenario. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual costs for small establishments are expected to range from $128 per building for SIC 6512, Operators of Nonresidential
Buildings to $723 per firm in SIC 1711, Plumbing, Heating and Air-Conditioning, as shown in Table 15, Column 4. Small-firm
compliance costs as a percentage of payroll, sales, and profits are fairly modest on both a per-worker and per-establishment
basis. Costs as a percentage of sales per establishment average 0.13 percent and do not exceed 0.3 percent in any industry,
whereas, for the case of zero cost pass-through, costs as a percentage of profits average 2.4 percent. OSHA has concluded
that no differential adverse impact will be experienced by small firms in any construction sector when compared to
larger firms because the costs of compliance are expected to be roughly equivalent on a per-worker basis.

Routine maintenance in industrial facilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In profiling asbestos maintenance activities within general industry, OSHA and CONSAD have assumed that the majority
of the work would be performed by plant and maintenance personnel within the establishment. Under this assumption,
incremental costs attributed to requirements in the revised construction standard that pertain to these maintenance
tasks would financially impact general industry. Therefore, economic impacts associated with routine maintenance
in general industry are included in this section on impacts under the construction standard. Impacts in affected
general industry sectors are shown in Tables 16 and 17.

Economic impacts from costs of compliance in industrial facilities were computed in terms of price impacts and profit
impacts. As shown in Table 16, average economic impacts across all affected establishments are expected to be minimal.
Price impacts_costs as a percentage of sales_would average 0.01 percent if firms were able to pass forward all compliance
costs to consumers. If full cost pass-through is not achievable and affected firms must finance compliance expenditures
from retained earnings, OSHA anticipates that profit impacts would be no greater than 0.21 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 17 presents economic impacts on small firms in general industry where routine asbestos maintenance takes place.
The results suggest that no serious economic consequences are expected from compliance with the revision to the final
rule. Impacts on sales average 0.01 percent, whereas impacts on profits average 0.21 percent and are no higher than
0.7 percent for any industry group. Therefore, OSHA concludes that there will be no significant differential effect
on small businesses in general industry performing routine maintenance involving contact with asbestos-containing
materials.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this section OSHA presented economic impact projections for affected industry groups in general industry, shipyards
and construction. Economic impact measures calculated by OSHA expressed percentage effects of compliance costs
on payroll, sales, and profits. On the basis of OSHA's analysis of the economic effects of the revised asbestos standard,
OSHA has determined that impacts will be modest for most affected industry groups. Therefore, OSHA judges the revised
asbestos standard to be economically feasible.

5 CFR 1320 sets forth procedures for agencies to follow in obtaining OMB clearance for information collection requirements
under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The final Asbestos standard requires the employer to allow
OSHA access to records and under certain circumstances, requires employers to submit notifications to the Agency.
OMB has reviewed and approved the collection of information requirements for occupational exposure to Asbestos
for Construction (29 CFR 1926.1101) and Shipyards (29 CFR 1915.1001) under OMB clearance numbers 1218&hyph;0134
and 1218&hyph;0195 respectively. The OMB clearances expire in July 1997. There were no new information collection
requirements for General industry 29 CFR 1910.1001, currently approved under 1218&hyph;0133. The Asbestos General
industry clearance expires in March 1996.

there is a reasonable possibility they may exceed, the permissible exposure limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Permissible exposure limit (PELS)_(1) Time-weighted average limit (TWA). The employer shall ensure that no
employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of asbestos excess of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air as an eight
(8)-hour time-weighted average (TWA) as determined by the method prescribed in Appendix A of this section, or by an
equivalent method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Excursion limit. The employer shall ensure that no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of asbestos
in excess of 1.0 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (1 f/cc) as averaged over a sampling period of thirty (30) minutes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Exposure monitoring._(1) General. (i) Determinations of employee exposure shall be made from breathing zone
air samples that are representative of the 8-hour TWA and 30-minute short-term exposures of each employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Representative 8-hour TWA employee exposures shall be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing
full-shift exposures for each shift for each employee in each job classification in each work area. Representative
30-minute short-term employee exposures shall be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing 30 minute
exposures associated with operations that are most likely to produce exposures above the excursion limit for each
shift for each job classification in each work area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Initial monitoring. (i) Each employer who has a workplace or work operation covered by this standard, except as
provided for in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (d)(2)(iii) of this section, shall perform initial monitoring of employees
who are, or may reasonably be expected to be exposed to airborne concentrations at or above the TWA permissible exposure
limit and/or excursion limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where the employer has monitored after March 31, 1992, for the TWA permissible exposure limit and/or the excursion
limit, and the monitoring satisfies all other requirements of this section, the employer may rely on such earlier
monitoring results to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Where the employer has relied upon objective data that demonstrate that asbestos is not capable of being released
in airborne concentrations at or above the TWA permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit under the expected
conditions of processing, use, or handling, then no initial monitoring is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Monitoring frequency (periodic monitoring) and patterns. After the initial determinations required by paragraph
(d)(2)(i) of this section, samples shall be of such frequency and pattern as to represent with reasonable accuracy
the levels of exposure of the employees. In no case shall sampling be at intervals greater than six months for employees
whose exposures may reasonably be foreseen to exceed the TWA permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Changes in monitoring frequency. If either the initial or the periodic monitoring required by paragraphs (d)(2)
and (d)(3) of this section statistically indicates that employee exposures are below the TWA permissible exposure
limit and/or excursion limit, the employer may discontinue the monitoring for those employees whose exposures are
represented by such monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Additional monitoring. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (d)(4) of this section,
the employer shall institute the exposure monitoring required under paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (d)(3) of this section
whenever there has been a change in the production, process, control equipment, personnel or work practices that
may result in new or additional exposures above the TWA permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit or when
the employer has any reason to suspect that a change may result in new or additional exposures above the action level
and/or excursion limit.

using the OSHA Reference Method (ORM) specified in Appendix A of this section, or an equivalent counting method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If an equivalent method to the ORM is used, the employer shall ensure that the method meets the following criteria:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Replicate exposure data used to establish equivalency are collected in side-by-side field and laboratory comparisons;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The comparison indicates that 90% of the samples collected in the range 0.5 to 2.0 times the permissible limit have
an accuracy range of plus or minus 25 percent of the ORM results at a 95% confidence level as demonstrated by a statistically
valid protocol; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The equivalent method is documented and the results of the comparison testing are maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) To satisfy the monitoring requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, employers must use the results of monitoring
analysis performed by laboratories which have instituted quality assurance programs that include the elements
as prescribed in Appendix A of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Employee notification of monitoring results. (i) The employer shall, within 15 working days after the receipt
of the results of any monitoring performed under the standard, notify the affected employees of these results in writing
either individually or by posting of results in an appropriate location that is accessible to affected employees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The written notification required by paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section shall contain the corrective action
being taken by the employer to reduce employee exposure to or below the TWA and/or excursion limit, wherever monitoring
results indicated that the TWA and/or excursion limit had been exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Regulated Areas._(1) Establishment. The employer shall establish regulated areas wherever airborne concentrations
of asbestos and/or PACM are in excess of the TWA and/or excursion limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(f) Methods of compliance._(1) Engineering controls and work practices. (i) The employer shall institute engineering
controls and work practices to reduce and maintain employee exposure to or below the TWA and/or excursion limit prescribed
in paragraph (c) of this section, except to the extent that such controls are not feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Wherever the feasible engineering controls and work practices that can be instituted are not sufficient to reduce
employee exposure to or below the TWA and/or excursion limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, the employer
shall use them to reduce employee exposure to the lowest levels achievable by these controls and shall supplement
them by the use of respiratory protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For the following operations, wherever feasible engineering controls and work practices that can be instituted
are not sufficient to reduce the employee exposure to or below the TWA and/or excursion limit prescribed in paragraph
(c) of this section, the employer shall use them to reduce employee exposure to or below 0.5 fiber per cubic centimeter
of air (as an eight-hour time-weighted average) or 2.5 fibers/cc for 30 minutes (short-term exposure) and shall supplement
them by the use of any combination of respiratory protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph (g)
of this section, work practices and feasible engineering controls that will reduce employee exposure to or below
the TWA and to or below the excursion limit permissible prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section: Coupling cutoff
in primary asbestos cement pipe manufacturing; sanding in primary and secondary asbestos cement sheet manufacturing;
grinding in primary and secondary friction product manufacturing; carding and spinning in dry textile processes;
and grinding and sanding in primary plastics manufacturing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Local exhaust ventilation. Local exhaust ventilation and dust collection systems shall be designed, constructed,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(viii) Particular products and operations. No asbestos cement, mortar, coating, grout, plaster, or similar material
containing asbestos, shall be removed from bags, cartons, or other containers in which they are shipped, without
being either wetted, or enclosed, or ventilated so as to prevent effectively the release of airborne fibers of. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Compressed air. Compressed air shall not be used to remove asbestos or materials containing asbestos unless
the compressed air is used in conjunction with a ventilation system which effectively captures the dust cloud created
by the compressed air.

(x) Flooring. Sanding of asbestos-containing flooring material is prohibited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Compliance program. (i) Where the TWA and/or excursion limit is exceeded, the employer shall establish and implement
a written program to reduce employee exposure to or below the TWA and to or below the excursion limit by means of engineering
and work practice controls as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and by the use of respiratory protection
where required or permitted under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Such programs shall be reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect significant changes in the status of the employer's
compliance program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Written programs shall be submitted upon request for examination and copying to the Assistant Secretary, the
Director, affected employees and designated employee representatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The employer shall not use employee rotation as a means of compliance with the TWA and/or excursion limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Specific compliance methods for brake and clutch repair: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Engineering controls and work practices for brake and clutch repair and service. During automotive brake and
clutch inspection, disassembly, repair and assembly operations, the employer shall institute engineering controls
and work practices to reduce employee exposure to materials containing asbestos using a negative pressure enclosure/HEPA
vacuum system method or low pressure/wet cleaning method, which meets the detailed requirements set out in Appendix
F to this section. The employer may also comply using an equivalent method which follows written procedures which
the employer demonstrates can achieve results equivalent to Method A in Appendix F to this section. For facilities
in which no more than 5 pair of brakes or 5 clutches are inspected, disassembled, repaired, or assembled per week, the
method set forth in paragraph [D] of Appendix F of this section may be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The employer may also comply by using an equivalent method which follows written procedures, which the employer
demonstrates can achieve equivalent exposure reductions as do the two ``preferred methods.'' Such demonstration
must include monitoring data conducted under workplace conditions closely resembling the process, type of asbestos
containing materials, control method, work practices and environmental conditions which the equivalent method
will be used, or objective data, which document that under all reasonably foreseeable conditions of brake and clutch
repair applications, the method results in exposures which are equivalent to the methods set out in Appendix F to this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Respiratory protection_(1) General. The employer shall provide respirators, and ensure that they are used,
where required by this section. Respirators shall be used in the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) During the interval necessary to install or implement feasible engineering and work practice controls; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In work operations, such as maintenance and repair activities, or other activities for which engineering and
work practice controls are not feasible; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) In work situations where feasible engineering and work practice controls are not yet sufficient to reduce exposure
to or below the TWA and/or excursion limit; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) In emergencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Respirator selection. (i) Where respirators are required under this section, the employer shall select and provide,
at no cost to the employee, the appropriate respirator as specified in Table 1. The employer shall select respirators
from among those jointly approved as being acceptable for protection by the Mine Safety and Health Administration
(MSHA) and by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) under the provisions of 30 CFR Part
11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The employer shall provide a powered, air-purifying respirator in lieu of any negative pressure respirator
specified in Table 1 whenever: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) An employee chooses to use this type of respirator; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) This respirator will provide adequate protection to the employee.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Communication of hazards to employees_Introduction. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section applies to the communication of information concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos hazards in general industry to facilitate compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this standard. Asbestos exposure in general industry occurs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a wide variety of industrial and commercial settings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employees who manufacture asbestos-containing products may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to asbestos fibers. Employees who repair and replace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automotive brakes and clutches may be exposed to asbestos fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, employees engaged in housekeeping activities in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial facilities with asbestos product manufacturing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations, and in public and commercial buildings with installed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos containing materials may be exposed to asbestos fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of these workers are covered by this general industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, with the exception of state or local governmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees in non-state plan states. It should be noted that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees who perform housekeeping activities during and after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction activities are covered by the asbestos construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, 29 CFR 1926.1101, formerly 1926.58). However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housekeeping employees, regardless of industry designation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should know whether building components they maintain may expose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them to asbestos. The same hazard communication provisions will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect employees who perform housekeeping operations in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three asbestos standards; general industry, construction, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipyard employment. As noted in the construction standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building owners are often the only and/or best source of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information concerning the presence of previously installed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos containing building materials. Therefore they, along 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with employers of potentially exposed employees, are assigned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific information conveying and retention duties under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Installed Asbestos Containing Material. Employers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building owners are required to treat installed TSI and sprayed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on and troweled-on surfacing materials as ACM for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this standard. These materials are designated ``presumed ACM or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PACM'', and are defined in paragraph (B) of this standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asphalt and vinyl flooring material installed no later than 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also must be treated as asbestos-containing. The employer or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building owner may demonstrate that PACM and flooring material do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not contain asbestos by complying with paragraph (j)(6) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Duties of employers and building and facility owners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Employers and building and facility owners shall exercise due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diligence in complying with these requirements to inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers and employees about the presence and location of ACM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and PACM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Building and facility owners shall maintain records of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all information required to be provided pursuant to this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or otherwise known to the building owner concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence, location and quantity of ACM and PACM in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building/facility. Such records shall be kept for the duration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ownership and shall be transferred to successive owners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Building and facility owners shall inform employers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees, and employers shall inform employees who will perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housekeeping activities in areas which contain ACM and/or PACM of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the presence and location of ACM and PACM in such areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Identification of ACM and PACM shall be made by an industrial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hygienists or by persons whose skill and experience with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to identification of asbestos hazards, is the equivalent to that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of industrial hygienists and so can be demonstrated by the owner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Warning signs. (i) Posting. Warning signs shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.1. History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Early surveys to determine asbestos exposures were conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using impinger counts of total dust with the counts expressed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million particles per cubic foot. The British Asbestos Research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council recommended filter membrane counting in 1969. In July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1969, the Bureau of Occupational Safety and Health published a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filter membrane method for counting asbestos fibers in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. This method was refined by NIOSH and published as P &amp; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CAM 239. On May 29, 1971, OSHA specified filter membrane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling with phase contrast counting for evaluation of asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures at work sites in the United States. The use of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technique was again required by OSHA in 1986. Phase contrast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopy has continued to be the method of choice for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement of occupational exposure to asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.2. Principle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Air is drawn through a MCE filter to capture airborne asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers. A wedge shaped portion of the filter is removed, placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a glass microscope slide and made transparent. A measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area (field) is viewed by PCM. All the fibers meeting a defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for asbestos are counted and considered a measure of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airborne asbestos concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.3. Advantages and Disadvantages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
There are four main advantages of PCM over other methods: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The technique is specific for fibers. Phase contrast is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber counting technique which excludes non-fibrous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particles from the analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The technique is inexpensive and does not require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specialized knowledge to carry out the analysis for total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber counts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The analysis is quick and can be performed on-site for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rapid determination of air concentrations of asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The technique has continuity with historical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epidemiological studies so that estimates of expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease can be inferred from long-term determinations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The main disadvantage of PCM is that it does not positively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify asbestos fibers. Other fibers which are not asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be included in the count unless differential counting is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed. This requires a great deal of experience to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately differentiate asbestos from non-asbestos fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Positive identification of asbestos must be performed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polarized light or electron microscopy techniques. A further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disadvantage of PCM is that the smallest visible fibers are about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.2 &mu;m in diameter while the finest asbestos fibers may be as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small as 0.02 &mu;m in diameter. For some exposures, substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more fibers may be present than are actually counted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1.4. Workplace Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos is used by the construction industry in such products as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shingles, floor tiles, asbestos cement, roofing felts, insulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and acoustical products. Non-construction uses include brakes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clutch facings, paper, paints, plastics, and fabrics. One of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most significant exposures in the workplace is the removal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encapsulation of asbestos in schools, public buildings, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
homes. Many workers have the potential to be exposed to asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during these operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
About 95% of the asbestos in commercial use in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States is chrysotile. Crocidolite and amosite make up most of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the remainder. Anthophyllite and tremolite or actinolite are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to be encountered as contaminants in various industrial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.5. Physical Properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos fiber possesses a high tensile strength along its axis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is chemically inert, non-combustible, and heat resistant. It has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a high electrical resistance and good sound absorbing properties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It can be weaved into cables, fabrics or other textiles, and also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matted into asbestos papers, felts, or mats.

2. Range and Detection Limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
2.1. The ideal counting range on the filter is 100 to 1,300 fibers/mm2. With a Walton-Beckett graticule this range
is equivalent to 0.8 to 10 fibers/field. Using NIOSH counting statistics, a count of 0.8 fibers/field would give an
approximate coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.13. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.2. The detection limit for this method is 4.0 fibers per 100 fields or 5.5 fibers/mm2. This was determined using an
equation to estimate the maximum CV possible at a specific concentration (95% confidence) and a Lower Control Limit
of zero. The CV value was then used to determine a corresponding concentration from historical CV vs fiber relationships.
As an example:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
Lower Control Limit (95% Confidence) = AC ^ 1.645(CV)(AC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
AC = Estimate of the airborne fiber concentration (fibers/cc) Setting the Lower Control Limit = 0 and solving for CV:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0 = AC ^ 1.645(CV)(AC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CV = 0.61
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This value was compared with CV vs. count curves. The count at which CV = 0.61 for Leidel-Busch counting statistics
or for an OSHA Salt Lake Technical Center (OSHA&hyph;SLTC) CV curve (see Appendix A for further information) was 4.4
fibers or 3.9 fibers per 100 fields, respectively. Although a lower detection limit of 4 fibers per 100 fields is supported
by the OSHA&hyph;SLTC data, both data sets support the 4.5 fibers per 100 fields value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Method Performance_Precision and Accuracy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Precision is dependent upon the total number of fibers counted and the uniformity of the fiber distribution on the
filter. A general rule is to count at least 20 and not more than 100 fields. The count is discontinued when 100 fibers
are counted, provided that 20 fields have already been counted. Counting more than 100 fibers results in only a small
gain in precision. As the total count drops below 10 fibers, an accelerated loss of precision is noted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, there is no known method to determine the absolute accuracy of the asbestos analysis. Results of samples
prepared through the Proficiency Analytical Testing (PAT) Program and analyzed by the OSHA&hyph;SLTC showed no
significant bias when compared to PAT reference values. The PAT samples were analyzed from 1987 to 1989 (N=36) and
the concentration range was from 120 to 1,300 fibers/mm2.

4. Interferences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Fibrous substances, if present, may interfere with asbestos analysis.

5.1.1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Sample assembly (The assembly is shown in Figure 3). Conductive filter holder consisting of a 25-mm diameter, 3-piece
cassette having a 50-mm long electrically conductive extension cowl. Backup pad, 25-mm, cellulose. Membrane filter,
mixed-cellulose ester (MCE), 25-mm, plain, white, 0.8- to 1.2-&mu;m pore size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notes: (a) Do not re-use cassettes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Fully conductive cassettes are required to reduce fiber loss to the sides of the cassette due to electrostatic
attraction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Purchase filters which have been selected by the manufacturer for asbestos counting or analyze representative
filters for fiber background before use. Discard the filter lot if more than 4 fibers/100 fields are found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) To decrease the possibility of contamination, the sampling system (filter-backup pad-cassette) for asbestos
is usually preassembled by the manufacturer.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
5.2.4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Select an appropriate flow rate for the situation being monitored. The sampling flow rate must be between 0.5 and 5.0
L/min for personal sampling and is commonly set between 1 and 2 L/min. Always choose a flow rate that will not produce
overloaded filters.

5.2.5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Calibrate each sampling pump before and after sampling with a calibration cassette in-line (Note: This calibration
cassette should be from the same lot of cassettes used for sampling). Use a primary standard (e.g. bubble burette)
to calibrate each pump. If possible, calibrate at the sampling site.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If sampling site calibration is not possible, environmental influences may affect the flow rate. The extent is dependent
on the type of pump used. Consult with the pump manufacturer to determine dependence on environmental influences.
If the pump is affected by temperature and pressure changes, use the formula in Appendix B to calculate the actual flow
rate.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Connect each pump to the base of each sampling cassette with flexible tubing. Remove the end cap of each cassette and
take each air sample open face. Assure that each sample cassette is held open side down in the employee's breathing
zone during sampling. The distance from the nose/mouth of the employee to the cassette should be about 10 cm. Secure
the cassette on the collar or lapel of the employee using spring clips or other similar devices.

Caution: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Do not overload the filter with dust. High levels of non-fibrous dust particles may obscure fibers on the filter and
lower the count or make counting impossible. If more than about 25 to 30% of the field area is obscured with dust, the
result may be biased low. Smaller air volumes may be necessary when there is excessive non-asbestos dust in the air.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While sampling, observe the filter with a small flashlight. If there is a visible layer of dust on the filter, stop sampling,
remove and seal the cassette, and replace with a new sampling assembly. The total dust loading should not exceed 1 mg.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
5.2.9. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Blank samples are used to determine if any contamination has occurred during sample handling. Prepare two blanks
for the first 1 to 20 samples. For sets containing greater than 20 samples, prepare blanks as 10% of the samples. Handle
blank samples in the same manner as air samples with one exception: Do not draw any air through the blank samples. Open
the blank cassette in the place where the sample cassettes are mounted on the employee. Hold it open for about 30 seconds.
Close and seal the cassette appropriately. Store blanks for shipment with the sample cassettes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
5.2.10. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Immediately after sampling, close and seal each cassette with the base and plastic plugs. Do not touch or puncture
the filter membrane as this will invalidate the analysis.

Attach a seal (OSHA&hyph;21 or equivalent) around each cassette in such a way as to secure the end cap plug and base plug.
Tape the ends of the seal together since the seal is not long enough to be wrapped end-to-end. Also wrap tape around the
cassette at each joint to keep the seal secure.

6.4. Standard Preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A way to prepare standard asbestos samples of known concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has not been developed. It is possible to prepare replicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples of nearly equal concentration. This has been performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the PAT program. These asbestos samples are distributed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the AIHA to participating laboratories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since only about one-fourth of a 25&hyph;mm sample membrane is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for an asbestos count, any PAT sample can serve as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``standard'' for replicate counting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
6.5. Sample Mounting

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
See Safety Precautions in Section 6.1. before proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective is to produce samples with a smooth (non-grainy) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
background in a medium with a refractive index of approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.46. The technique below collapses the filter for easier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focusing and produces permanent mounts which are useful for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality control and interlaboratory comparison.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An aluminum block or similar device is required for sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation. A drawing is shown in Figure 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.5.1. Heat the aluminum block to about 70
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C. The hot block 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be used on any surface that can be damaged by either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the heat or from exposure to acetone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.5.2. Ensure that the glass slides and cover glasses are free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of dust and fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.5.3. Remove the top plug to prevent a vacuum when the cassette 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is opened. Clean the outside of the cassette if necessary. Cut 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the seal and/or tape on the cassette with a razor blade. Very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carefully separate the base from the extension cowl, leaving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filter and backup pad in the base. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.5.4. With a rocking motion cut a triangular wedge from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filter using the scalpel. This wedge should be one-sixth to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-fourth of the filter. Grasp the filter wedge with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forceps on the perimeter of the filter which was clamped between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cassette pieces. DO NOT TOUCH the filter with your finger. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Place the filter on the glass slide sample side up. Static 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity will usually keep the filter on the slide until it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.5.5. Place the tip of the micropipette containing about 200 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
L 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acetone into the aluminum block. Insert the glass slide into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving slot in the aluminum block. Inject the acetone into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the block with slow, steady pressure on the plunger while holding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pipette firmly in place. Wait 3 to 5 seconds for the filter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to clear, then remove the pipette and slide from the aluminum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
block. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.5.6. Immediately (less than 30 seconds) place 2.5 to 3.5 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
L of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triacetin on the filter (Note: Waiting longer than 30 seconds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will result in increased index of refraction and decreased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrast between the fibers and the preparation. This may also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead to separation of the cover slip from the slide). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.5.7. Lower a cover slip gently onto the filter at a slight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
angle to reduce the possibility of forming air bubbles. If more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 30 seconds have elapsed between acetone exposure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triacetin application, glue the edges of the cover slip to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slide with lacquer or nail polish.

6.6. Sample Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Completely align the microscope according to the manufacturer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions. Then, align the microscope using the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general alignment routine at the beginning of every counting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
session and more often if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
 Alignment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Clean all optical surfaces. Even a small amount of dirt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can significantly degrade the image. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Rough focus the objective on a sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Close down the field iris so that it is visible in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field of view. Focus the image of the iris with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condenser focus. Center the image of the iris in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field of view. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Install the phase telescope and focus on the phase rings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critically center the rings. Misalignment of the rings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in astigmatism which will degrade the image. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Place the phase-shift test slide on the microscope stage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and focus on the lines. The analyst must see line set 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and should see at least parts of 4 and 5 but, not see line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set 6 or 6. A microscope/microscopist combination which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not pass this test may not be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=3 -->
6.6.2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
 Counting Fibers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Place the prepared sample slide on the mechanical stage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the microscope. Position the center of the wedge under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the objective lens and focus upon the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Start counting from one end of the wedge and progress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
along a radial line to the other end (count in either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direction from perimeter to wedge tip). Select fields 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
randomly, without looking into the eyepieces, by slightly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advancing the slide in one direction with the mechanical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stage control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Continually scan over a range of focal planes (generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the upper 10 to 15 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m of the filter surface) with the fine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focus control during each field count. Spend at least 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 15 seconds per field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Most samples will contain asbestos fibers with fiber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diameters less than 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m. Look carefully for faint fiber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
images. The small diameter fibers will be very hard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
see. However, they are an important contribution to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total count. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Count only fibers equal to or longer than 5 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m. Measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the length of curved fibers along the curve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Count fibers which have a length to width ratio of 3:1 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Count all the fibers in at least 20 fields. Continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counting until either 100 fibers are counted or 100 fields 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been viewed; whichever occurs first. Count all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers in the final field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Fibers lying entirely within the boundary of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Walton-Beckett graticule field shall receive a count of 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fibers crossing the boundary once, having one end within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the circle shall receive a count of 1/2. Do not count any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber that crosses the graticule boundary more than once. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reject and do not count any other fibers even though they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be visible outside the graticule area. If a fiber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
touches the circle, it is considered to cross the line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Count bundles of fibers as one fiber unless individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers can be clearly identified and each individual fiber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is clearly not connected to another counted fiber. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Figure 2 for counting conventions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Record the number of fibers in each field in a consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way such that filter non-uniformity can be assessed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Regularly check phase ring alignment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) When an agglomerate (mass of material) covers more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25% of the field of view, reject the field and select 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another. Do not include it in the number of fields 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) Perform a ``blind recount'' of 1 in every 10 filter wedges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(slides). Re-label the slides using a person other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the original counter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously mentioned in Section 1.3., PCM does not provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive confirmation of asbestos fibers. Alternate differential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counting techniques should be used if discrimination is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desirable. Differential counting may include primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination based on morphology, polarized light analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers, or modification of PCM data by Scanning Electron or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transmission Electron Microscopy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A great deal of experience is required to routinely and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correctly perform differential counting. It is discouraged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless it is legally necessary. Then, only if a fiber is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obviously not asbestos should it be excluded from the count. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further discussion of this technique can be found in reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there is a question whether a fiber is asbestos or not, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follow the rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Each analyst shall select and count prepared slides from

a ``slide bank''. These are quality assurance counts. The slide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank shall be prepared using uniformly distributed samples taken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the workload. Fiber densities should cover the entire range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routinely analyzed by the laboratory. These slides are counted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blind by all counters to establish an original standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation. This historical distribution is compared with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality assurance counts. A counter must have 95% of all quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control samples counted within three standard deviations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical mean. This count is then integrated into a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical mean and standard deviation for the slide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analyses done by the counters to establish the slide bank

Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The collection area of a filter is seldom equal to 385 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mm2. It is appropriate for laboratories to routinely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor the exact diameter using an inside micrometer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection area is calculated according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula:

7.2. Short-cut Calculation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since a given analyst always has the same interpupillary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distance, the number of fields per filter for a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyst will remain constant for a given size filter. The field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size for that analyst is constant (i.e. the analyst is using an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned microscope and is not changing the reticle). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if the exposed area of the filter is always 385 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mm2 and the size of the field is always 0.00785 mm2, the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of fields per filter will always be 49,000. In addition it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to convert liters of air to cc. These three constants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can then be combined such that ECA/(1,000 X MFA)=49. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous equation simplifies to:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned in step 13 of Section 6.6.2., a ``blind recount'' of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10% of the slides is performed. In all cases, differences will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be observed between the first and second counts of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filter wedge. Most of these differences will be due to chance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alone, that is, due to the random variability (precision) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
count method. Statistical recount criteria enables one to decide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether observed differences can be explained due to chance alone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or are probably due to systematic differences between analysts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopes, or other biasing factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following recount criterion is for a pair of counts that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate AC in fibers/cc. The criterion is given at the type-I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
error level. That is, there is 5% maximum risk that we will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reject a pair of counts for the reason that one might be biased, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the large observed difference is really due to chance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The OSHA asbestos regulations require each laboratory to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a quality control program. The following is presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an example of how the OSHA-SLTC constructed its internal CV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
curve as part of meeting this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data for the CV curve shown below is from 395 samples collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during OSHA compliance inspections and analyzed from October 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through April 1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each sample was counted by 2 to 5 different counters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independently of one another. The standard deviation and the CV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistic was calculated for each sample. This data was then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plotted on a graph of CV vs. fibers/mm
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When ordering the Graticule for asbestos counting, specify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exact disc diameter needed to fit the ocular of the microscope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the diameter (mm) of the circular counting area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instructions for measuring the dimensions necessary are listed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Insert any available graticule into the focusing eyepiece 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and focus so that the graticule lines are sharp and clear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Align the microscope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Place a stage micrometer on the microscope object stage and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focus the microscope on the graduated lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Measure the magnified grid length, PL (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m), using the stage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
micrometer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Remove the graticule from the microscope and measure its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual grid length, AL (mm). This can be accomplished by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using a mechanical stage fitted with verniers, or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeweler's loupe with a direct reading scale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

work practices that must be implemented by the employer during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automotive brake and clutch inspection, disassembly, repair, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembly operations. Proper use of these engineering controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and work practices will reduce employees' asbestos exposure below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the permissible exposure level during clutch and brake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection, disassembly, repair, and assembly operations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer shall institute engineering controls and work practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using either the method set forth in paragraph [A] or paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[B] of this appendix, or any other method which the employer can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate to be equivalent in terms of reducing employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to asbestos as defined and which meets the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in paragraph [C] of this appendix, for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities in which no more than 5 pairs of brakes or 5 clutches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are inspected, disassembled, reassembled and/or repaired per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

[A] Negative Pressure Enclosure/HEPA Vacuum System Method
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
(1) The brake and clutch inspection, disassembly, repair, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembly operations shall be enclosed to cover and contain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clutch or brake assembly and to prevent the release of asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers into the worker's breathing zone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The enclosure shall be sealed tightly and thoroughly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspected for leaks before work begins on brake and clutch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection, disassembly, repair, and assembly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The enclosure shall be such that the worker can clearly see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operation and shall provide impermeable sleeves through which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the worker can handle the brake and clutch inspection, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disassembly, repair and assembly. The integrity of the sleeves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and ports shall be examined before work begins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A HEPA-filtered vacuum shall be employed to maintain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enclosure under negative pressure throughout the operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compressed-air may be used to remove asbestos fibers or particles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the enclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The HEPA vacuum shall be used first to loosen the asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing residue from the brake and clutch parts and then to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evacuate the loosened asbestos containing material from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enclosure and capture the material in the vacuum filter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The vacuum's filter, when full, shall be first wetted with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fine mist of water, then removed and placed immediately in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impermeable container, labeled according to paragraph (j)(2)(ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section and disposed of according to paragraph (k) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Any spills or releases of asbestos containing waste material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from inside of the enclosure or vacuum hose or vacuum filter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be immediately cleaned up and disposed of according to

(1) A catch basin shall be placed under the brake assembly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positioned to avoid splashes and spills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The reservoir shall contain water containing an organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvent or wetting agent. The flow of liquid shall be controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such that the brake assembly is gently flooded to prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos-containing brake dust from becoming airborne. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The aqueous solution shall be allowed to flow between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake drum and brake support before the drum is removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) After removing the brake drum, the wheel hub and back of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake assembly shall be thoroughly wetted to suppress dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The brake support plate, brake shoes and brake components 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to attach the brake shoes shall be thoroughly washed before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removing the old shoes.

so that it can be reproduced and has been demonstrated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures resulting from the equivalent method are equal to or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than the exposures which would result from the use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method described in paragraph [A] of this appendix. For purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of making this comparison, the employer shall assume that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1.1. History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Light microscopy has been used for well over 100 years for the determination of mineral species. This analysis is carried
out using specialized polarizing microscopes as well as bright field microscopes. The identification of minerals
is an on-going process with many new minerals described each year. The first recorded use of asbestos was in Finland
about 2500 B.C. where the material was used in the mud wattle for the wooden huts the people lived in as well as strengthening
for pottery. Adverse health aspects of the mineral were noted nearly 2000 years ago when Pliny the Younger wrote about
the poor health of slaves in the asbestos mines. Although known to be injurious for centuries, the first modern references
to its toxicity were by the British Labor Inspectorate when it banned asbestos dust from the workplace in 1898. Asbestosis
cases were described in the literature after the turn of the century. Cancer was first suspected in the mid 1930's and
a causal link to mesothelioma was made in 1965. Because of the public concern for worker and public safety with the use
of this material, several different types of analysis were applied to the determination of asbestos content. Light
microscopy requires a great deal of experience and craft. Attempts were made to apply less subjective methods to the
analysis. X-ray diffraction was partially successful in determining the mineral types but was unable to separate
out the fibrous portions from the non-fibrous portions. Also, the minimum detection limit for asbestos analysis
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) is about 1%. Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) was no more successful. These provide
useful corroborating information when the presence of asbestos has been shown by microscopy; however, neither can
determine the difference between fibrous and non-fibrous minerals when both habits are present. The same is true
of Infrared Absorption (IR).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When electron microscopy was applied to asbestos analysis, hundreds of fibers were discovered present too small
to be visible in any light microscope. There are two different types of electron microscope used for asbestos analysis:
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Scanning Electron Microscopy
is useful in identifying minerals. The SEM can provide two of the three pieces of information required to identify
fibers by electron microscopy: morphology and chemistry. The third is structure as determined by Selected Area Electron
Diffraction_SAED which is performed in the TEM. Although the resolution of the SEM is sufficient for very fine fibers
to be seen, accuracy of chemical analysis that can be performed on the fibers varies with fiber diameter in fibers of
less than 0.2 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m diameter. The TEM is a powerful tool to identify fibers too small to be resolved by light microscopy and should be used
in conjunction with this method when necessary. The TEM can provide all three pieces of information required for fiber
identification. Most fibers thicker than 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m can adequately be defined in the light microscope. The light microscope remains as the best instrument for the determination
of mineral type. This is because the minerals under investigation were first described analytically with the light
microscope. It is inexpensive and gives positive identification for most samples analyzed. Further, when optical
techniques are inadequate, there is ample indication that alternative techniques should be used for complete identification
of the sample.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.2. Principle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Minerals consist of atoms that may be arranged in random order or in a regular arrangement. Amorphous materials have
atoms in random order while crystalline materials have long range order. Many materials are transparent to light,
at least for small particles or for thin sections. The properties of these materials can be investigated by the effect
that the material has on light passing through it. The six asbestos minerals are all crystalline with particular properties
that have been identified and cataloged. These six minerals are anisotropic. They have a regular array of atoms, but
the arrangement is not the same in all directions. Each major direction of the crystal presents a different regularity.
Light photons travelling in each of these main directions will encounter different electrical neighborhoods, affecting
the path and time of travel. The techniques outlined in this method use the fact that light traveling through fibers
or crystals in different directions will behave differently, but predictably. The behavior of the light as it travels
through a crystal can be measured and compared with known or determined values to identify the mineral species. Usually,
Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM) is performed with strain-free objectives on a bright-field microscope platform.
This would limit the resolution of the microscope to about 0.4 &mu;m. Because OSHA requires the counting and identification
of fibers visible in phase contrast, the phase contrast platform is used to visualize the fibers with the polarizing
elements added into the light path. Polarized light methods cannot identify fibers finer than about 1 &mu;m in diameter
even though they are visible. The finest fibers are usually identified by inference from the presence of larger, identifiable
fiber bundles. When fibers are present, but not identifiable by light microscopy, use either SEM or TEM to determine
the fiber identity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.3. Advantages and Disadvantages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The advantages of light microcopy are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Basic identification of the materials was first performed by light microscopy and gross analysis. This provides
a large base of published information against which to check analysis and analytical technique.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The analysis is specific to fibers. The minerals present can exist in asbestiform, fibrous, prismatic, or massive
varieties all at the same time. Therefore, bulk methods of analysis such as X-ray diffraction, IR analysis, DTA, etc.
are inappropriate where the material is not known to be fibrous.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The analysis is quick, requires little preparation time, and can be performed on-site if a suitably equipped microscope
is available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disadvantages are:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Even using phase-polar illumination, not all the fibers present may be seen. This is a problem for very low asbestos
concentrations where agglomerations or large bundles of fibers may not be present to allow identification by inference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The method requires a great degree of sophistication on the part of the microscopist. An analyst is only as useful
as his mental catalog of images. Therefore, a microscopist's accuracy is enhanced by experience. The mineralogical
training of the analyst is very important. It is the basis on which subjective decisions are made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The method uses only a tiny amount of material for analysis. This may lead to sampling bias and false results (high
or low). This is especially true if the sample is severely inhomogeneous.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Fibers may be bound in a matrix and not distinguishable as fibers so identification cannot be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1.4.1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 This method can be used for determination of asbestos content from 0 to 100% asbestos. The detection limit has not been
adequately determined, although for selected samples, the limit is very low, depending on the number of particles
examined. For mostly homogeneous, finely divided samples, with no difficult fibrous interferences, the detection
limit is below 1%. For inhomogeneous samples (most samples), the detection limit remains undefined. NIST has conducted
proficiency testing of laboratories on a national scale. Although each round is reported statistically with an average,
control limits, etc., the results indicate a difficulty in establishing precision especially in the low concentration
range. It is suspected that there is significant bias in the low range especially near 1%. EPA tried to remedy this by
requiring a mandatory point counting scheme for samples less than 10%. The point counting procedure is tedious, and
may introduce significant biases of its own. It has not been incorporated into this method.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The precision and accuracy of the quantitation tests performed in this method are unknown. Concentrations are easier
to determine in commercial products where asbestos was deliberately added because the amount is usually more than
a few percent. An analyst's results can be ``calibrated'' against the known amounts added by the manufacturer. For
geological samples, the degree of homogeneity affects the precision.

1.4.3.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The performance of the method is analyst dependent. The analyst must choose carefully and not necessarily randomly
the portions for analysis to assure that detection of asbestos occurs when it is present. For this reason, the analyst
must have adequate training in sample preparation, and experience in the location and identification of asbestos
in samples. This is usually accomplished through substantial on-the-job training as well as formal education in
mineralogy and microscopy.

1.5. Interferences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any material which is long, thin, and small enough to be viewed under the microscope can be considered an interference
for asbestos. There are literally hundreds of interferences in workplaces. The techniques described in this method
are normally sufficient to eliminate the interferences. An analyst's success in eliminating the interferences
depends on proper training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos minerals belong to two mineral families: the serpentines and the amphiboles. In the serpentine family,
the only common fibrous mineral is chrysotile. Occasionally, the mineral antigorite occurs in a fibril habit with
morphology similar to the amphiboles. The amphibole minerals consist of a score of different minerals of which only
five are regulated by federal standard: amosite, crocidolite, anthophyllite asbestos, tremolite asbestos and
actinolite asbestos. These are the only amphibole minerals that have been commercially exploited for their fibrous
properties; however, the rest can and do occur occasionally in asbestiform habit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the related mineral interferences, other minerals common in building material may present a problem
for some microscopists: gypsum, anhydrite, brucite, quartz fibers, talc fibers or ribbons, wollastonite, perlite,
attapulgite, etc. Other fibrous materials commonly present in workplaces are: fiberglass, mineral wool, ceramic
wool, refractory ceramic fibers, kevlar, nomex, synthetic fibers, graphite or carbon fibers, cellulose (paper
or wood) fibers, metal fibers, etc.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Matrix embedding material can sometimes be a negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interference. The analyst may not be able to easily extract the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers from the matrix in order to use the method. Where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible, remove the matrix before the analysis, taking careful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
note of the loss of weight. Some common matrix materials are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vinyl, rubber, tar, paint, plant fiber, cement, and epoxy. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further negative interference is that the asbestos fibers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
themselves may be either too small to be seen in Phase contrast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Microscopy (PCM) or of a very low fibrous quality, having the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appearance of plant fibers. The analyst's ability to deal with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these materials increases with experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.6. Uses and Occupational Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos is ubiquitous in the environment. More than 40% of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
land area of the United States is composed of minerals which may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain asbestos. Fortunately, the actual formation of great 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts of asbestos is relatively rare. Nonetheless, there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations in which environmental exposure can be severe such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Serpentine Hills of California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are thousands of uses for asbestos in industry and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the home. Asbestos abatement workers are the most current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
segment of the population to have occupational exposure to great 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts of asbestos. If the material is undisturbed, there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. Exposure occurs when the asbestos-containing material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is abraded or otherwise disturbed during maintenance operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or some other activity. Approximately 95% of the asbestos in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place in the United States is chrysotile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amosite and crocidolite make up nearly all the difference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tremolite and anthophyllite make up a very small percentage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tremolite is found in extremely small amounts in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chrysotile deposits. Actinolite exposure is probably greatest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from environmental sources, but has been identified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vermiculite containing, sprayed-on insulating materials which may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been certified as asbestos-free. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.7. Physical and Chemical Properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The nominal chemical compositions for the asbestos minerals were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given in Section 1. Compared to cleavage fragments of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minerals, asbestiform fibers possess a high tensile strength 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
along the fiber axis. They are chemically inert, non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustible, and heat resistant. Except for chrysotile, they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insoluble in Hydrochloric acid (HCl). Chrysotile is slightly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soluble in HCl. Asbestos has high electrical resistance and good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sound absorbing characteristics. It can be woven into cables, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabrics or other textiles, or matted into papers, felts, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mats.

1.8. Toxicology (This Section is for Information Only and Should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not Be Taken as OSHA Policy) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Possible physiologic results of respiratory exposure to asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are mesothelioma of the pleura or peritoneum, interstitial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibrosis, asbestosis, pneumoconiosis, or respiratory cancer. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible consequences of asbestos exposure are detailed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIOSH Criteria Document or in the OSHA Asbestos Standards 29 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1910.1001 and 29 CFR 1926.1101.

2. Sampling Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2.1. Equipment for Sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Tube or cork borer sampling device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Knife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 20 mL scintillation vial or similar vial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Sealing encapsulant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2.2. Safety Precautions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos is a known carcinogen. Take care when sampling. While 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an asbestos-containing atmosphere, a properly selected and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fit-tested respirator should be worn. Take samples in a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to cause the least amount of dust. Follow these general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Do not make unnecessary dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Take only a small amount (1 to 2 g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Tightly close the sample container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Use encapsulant to seal the spot where the sample was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2.3. Sampling Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Samples of any suspect material should be taken from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconspicuous place. Where the material is to remain, seal the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling wound with an encapsulant to eliminate the potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure from the sample site. Microscopy requires only a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milligrams of material. The amount that will fill a 20 mL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scintillation vial is more than adequate. Be sure to collect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples from all layers and phases of material. If possible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make separate samples of each different phase of the material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This will aid in determining the actual hazard. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
DO NOT USE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ENVELOPES, PLASTIC OR PAPER BAGS OF ANY KIND TO COLLECT SAMPLES.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of plastic bags presents a contamination hazard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory personnel and to other samples. When these containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are opened, a bellows effect blows fibers out of the container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
onto everything, including the person opening the container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a cork-borer type sampler is available, push the tube 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the material all the way, so that all layers of material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are sampled. Some samplers are intended to be disposable. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be capped and sent to the laboratory. If a non-disposable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cork borer is used, empty the contents into a scintillation vial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and send to the laboratory. Vigorously and completely clean the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cork borer between samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2.4 Shipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Samples packed in glass vials must not touch or they might break 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Seal the samples with a sample seal (such as the OSHA 21) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the end to guard against tampering and to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Package the bulk samples in separate packages from the air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples. They may cross-contaminate each other and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invalidate the results of the air samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Include identifying paperwork 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
the samples, but not in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contact with the suspected asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) To maintain sample accountability, ship the samples by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified mail, overnight express, or hand carry them to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the laboratory.

3. Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis of asbestos samples can be divided into two major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts: sample preparation and microscopy. Because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different asbestos uses that may be encountered by the analyst, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each sample may need different preparation steps. The choices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are outlined below. There are several different tests that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed to identify the asbestos species and determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage. They will be explained below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
3.1. Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Do not create unnecessary dust. Handle the samples in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEPA-filter equipped hoods. If samples are received in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bags, envelopes or other inappropriate container, open 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them only in a hood having a face velocity at or greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 100 fpm. Transfer a small amount to a scintillation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vial and only handle the smaller amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Open samples in a hood, never in the open lab area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Index of refraction oils can be toxic. Take care not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
get this material on the skin. Wash immediately with soap 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and water if this happens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Samples that have been heated in the muffle furnace or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drying oven may be hot. Handle them with tongs until they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are cool enough to handle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Some of the solvents used, such as THF (tetrahydrofuran), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are toxic and should only be handled in an appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fume hood and according to instructions given in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3.3. Sample Pre-Preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Sample preparation begins with pre-preparation which may include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical reduction of the matrix, heating the sample to dryness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or heating in the muffle furnace. The end result is a sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which has been reduced to a powder that is sufficiently fine to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fit under the cover slip. Analyze different phases of samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately, e.g., tile and the tile mastic should be analyzed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately as the mastic may contain asbestos while the tile may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Samples with a high water content will not give the proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispersion colors and must be dried prior to sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mounting. Remove the lid of the scintillation vial, place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bottle in the drying oven and heat at 100 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C to dryness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(usually about 2 h). Samples which are not submitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lab in glass must be removed and placed in glass vials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or aluminum weighing pans before placing them in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drying oven.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These may include samples with tar as a matrix, vinyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos tile, or any other organic that can be reduced by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating. Remove the sample from the vial and weigh in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance to determine the weight of the submitted portion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Place the sample in a muffle furnace at 500 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C for 1 to 2 h 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or until all obvious organic material has been removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Retrieve, cool and weigh again to determine the weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss on ignition. This is necessary to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos content of the submitted sample, because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyst will be looking at a reduced sample.

Vinyl asbestos tile is the most common material treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this solvent, although, substances containing tar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will sometimes yield to this treatment. Select a portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the material and then grind it up if possible. Weigh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sample and place it in a test tube. Add sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
THF to dissolve the organic matrix. This is usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 4 to 5 mL. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

Carbonate material is often found on fibers and sometimes

Weigh out a portion of the material and place it in a test

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decalcifying solution in the tube to react all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

steps are carried out in the low-flow hood (a low-flow hood has

less than 50 fpm flow):

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If the sample has large lumps, is hard, or cannot be made to lie under a cover slip, the grain size must be reduced.
Place a small amount between two slides and grind the material between them or grind a small amount in a clean mortar
and pestle. The choice of whether to use an alumina, ruby, or diamond mortar depends on the hardness of the material.
Impact damage can alter the asbestos mineral if too much mechanical shock occurs. (Freezer mills can completely destroy
the observable crystallinity of asbestos and should not be used). For some samples, a portion of material can be shaved
off with a scalpel, ground off with a hand grinder or hack saw blade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preparation tools should either be disposable or cleaned thoroughly. Use vigorous scrubbing to loosen the fibers
during the washing. Rinse the implements with copious amounts of water and air-dry in a dust-free environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the sample is powder or has been reduced as in (1) above, it is ready to mount. Place a glass slide on a piece of optical
tissue and write the identification on the painted or frosted end. Place two drops of index of refraction medium n=1.550
on the slide. (The medium n=1.550 is chosen because it is the matching index for chrysotile. Dip the end of a clean paper-clip
or dissecting needle into the droplet of refraction medium on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 to moisten it. Then dip the probe into the powder sample. Transfer what sticks on the probe to the slide. The material
on the end of the probe should have a diameter of about 3 mm for a good mount. If the material is very fine, less sample may
be appropriate. For non-powder samples such as fiber mats, forceps should be used to transfer a small amount of material
to the slide. Stir the material in the medium on the slide, spreading it out and making the preparation as uniform as
possible. Place a cover-slip on the preparation by gently lowering onto the slide and allowing it to fall ``trapdoor''
fashion on the preparation to push out any bubbles. Press gently on the cover slip to even out the distribution of particulate
on the slide. If there is insufficient mounting oil on the slide, one or two drops may be placed near the edge of the coverslip
on the slide. Capillary action will draw the necessary amount of liquid into the preparation. Remove excess oil with
the point of a laboratory wiper.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treat at least two different areas of each phase in this fashion. Choose representative areas of the sample. It may
be useful to select particular areas or fibers for analysis. This is useful to identify asbestos in severely inhomogeneous
samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When it is determined that amphiboles may be present, repeat the above process using the appropriate high-dispersion
oils until an identification is made or all six asbestos minerals have been ruled out. Note that percent determination
must be done in the index medium 1.550 because amphiboles tend to disappear in their matching mediums.

The analysis consists of three parts: The determination of whether there is asbestos present, what type is present
and the determination of how much is present. The general flow of the analysis is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Gross examination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Examination under polarized light on the stereo microscope.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Examination by phase-polar illumination on the compound phase microscope.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Determination of species by dispersion stain. Examination by Becke line analysis may also be used; however, this
is usually more cumbersome for asbestos determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Difficult samples may need to be analyzed by SEM or TEM, or the results from those techniques combined with light
microscopy for a definitive identification. Identification of a particle as asbestos requires that it be asbestiform.
Description of particles should follow the suggestion of Campbell. (Figure 1)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purpose of regulation, the mineral must be one of the six minerals covered and must be in the asbestos growth
habit. Large specimen samples of asbestos generally have the gross appearance of wood. Fibers are easily parted from
it. Asbestos fibers are very long compared with their widths. The fibers have a very high tensile strength as demonstrated
by bending without breaking. Asbestos fibers exist in bundles that are easily parted, show longitudinal fine structure
and may be tufted at the ends showing ``bundle of sticks'' morphology. In the microscope some of these properties may
not be observable. Amphiboles do not always show striations along their length even when they are asbestos. Neither
will they always show tufting. They generally do not show a curved nature except for very long fibers. Asbestos and
asbestiform minerals are usually characterized in groups by extremely high aspect ratios (greater than 100:1).
While aspect ratio analysis is useful for characterizing populations of fibers, it cannot be used to identify individual
fibers of intermediate to short aspect ratio. Observation of many fibers is often necessary to determine whether
a sample consists of ``cleavage fragments'' or of asbestos fibers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most cleavage fragments of the asbestos minerals are easily distinguishable from true asbestos fibers. This is because
true cleavage fragments usually have larger diameters than 1 &mu;m. Internal structure of particles larger than
this usually shows them to have no internal fibrillar structure. In addition, cleavage fragments of the monoclinic
amphiboles show inclined extinction under crossed polars with no compensator. Asbestos fibers usually show extinction
at zero degrees or ambiguous extinction if any at all. Morphologically, the larger cleavage fragments are obvious
by their blunt or stepped ends showing prismatic habit. Also, they tend to be acicular rather than filiform.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the particles are less than 1 &mu;m in diameter and have an aspect ratio greater than or equal to 3:1, it is recommended
that the sample be analyzed by SEM or TEM if there is any question whether the fibers are cleavage fragments or asbestiform
particles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Care must be taken when analyzing by electron microscopy because the interferences are different from those in light
microscopy and may structurally be very similar to asbestos. The classic interference is between anthophyllite
and biopyribole or intermediate fiber. Use the same morphological clues for electron microscopy as are used for light
microscopy, e.g. fibril splitting, internal longitudinal striation, fraying, curvature, etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Gross examination: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examine the sample, preferably in the glass vial. Determine the presence of any obvious fibrous component. Estimate
a percentage based on previous experience and current observation. Determine whether any pre- preparation is necessary.
Determine the number of phases present. This step may be carried out or augmented by observation at 6 to 40&times; under
a stereo microscope.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) After performing any necessary pre-preparation, prepare slides of each phase as described above. Two preparations
of the same phase in the same index medium can be made side-by-side on the same glass for convenience. Examine with the
polarizing stereo microscope. Estimate the percentage of asbestos based on the amount of birefringent fiber present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Examine the slides on the phase-polar microscopes at magnifications of 160 and 400&times;. Note the morphology
of the fibers. Long, thin, very straight fibers with little curvature are indicative of fibers from the amphibole
family. Curved, wavy fibers are usually indicative of chrysotile. Estimate the percentage of asbestos on the phase-polar
microscope under conditions of crossed polars and a gypsum plate. Fibers smaller than 1.0 &mu;m in thickness must
be identified by inference to the presence of larger, identifiable fibers and morphology. If no larger fibers are
visible, electron microscopy should be performed. At this point, only a tentative identification can be made. Full
identification must be made with dispersion microscopy. Details of the tests are included in the appendices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Once fibers have been determined to be present, they must be identified. Adjust the microscope for dispersion
mode and observe the fibers. The microscope has a rotating stage, one polarizing element, and a system for generating
dark-field dispersion microscopy (see Section 4.6. of this appendix). Align a fiber with its length parallel to the
polarizer and note the color of the Becke lines. Rotate the stage to bring the fiber length perpendicular to the polarizer
and note the color. Repeat this process for every fiber or fiber bundle examined. The colors must be consistent with
the colors generated by standard asbestos reference materials for a positive identification. In n=1.550, amphiboles
will generally show a yellow to straw-yellow color indicating that the fiber indices of refraction are higher than
the liquid. If long, thin fibers are noted and the colors are yellow, prepare further slides as above in the suggested
matching liquids listed below:

Where more than one liquid is suggested, the first is preferred; however, in some cases this liquid will not give good
dispersion color. Take care to avoid interferences in the other liquid; e.g., wollastonite in n=1.620 will give the
same colors as tremolite. In n=1.605 wollastonite will appear yellow in all directions. Wollastonite may be determined
under crossed polars as it will change from blue to yellow as it is rotated along its fiber axis by tapping on the cover
slip. Asbestos minerals will not change in this way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determination of the angle of extinction may, when present, aid in the determination of anthophyllite from tremolite.
True asbestos fibers usually have 0
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; extinction or ambiguous extinction, while cleavage fragments have more definite extinction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continue analysis until both preparations have been examined and all present species of asbestos are identified.
If there are no fibers present, or there is less than 0.1% present, end the analysis with the minimum number of slides
(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Some fibers have a coating on them which makes dispersion microscopy very difficult or impossible. Becke line
analysis or electron microscopy may be performed in those cases. Determine the percentage by light microscopy. TEM
analysis tends to overestimate the actual percentage present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Percentage determination is an estimate of occluded area, tempered by gross observation. Gross observation
information is used to make sure that the high magnification microscopy does not greatly over- or under- estimate
the amount of fiber present. This part of the analysis requires a great deal of experience. Satisfactory models for
asbestos content analysis have not yet been developed, although some models based on metallurgical grain-size determination
have found some utility. Estimation is more easily handled in situations where the grain sizes visible at about 160&times;
are about the same and the sample is relatively homogeneous.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
View all of the area under the cover slip to make the percentage determination. View the fields while moving the stage,
paying attention to the clumps of material. These are not usually the best areas to perform dispersion microscopy
because of the interference from other materials. But, they are the areas most likely to represent the accurate percentage
in the sample. Small amounts of asbestos require slower scanning and more frequent analysis of individual fields.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report the area occluded by asbestos as the concentration. This estimate does not generally take into consideration
the difference in density of the different species present in the sample. For most samples this is adequate. Simulation
studies with similar materials must be carried out to apply microvisual estimation for that purpose and is beyond
the scope of this procedure.

(7) Where successive concentrations have been made by chemical or physical means, the amount reported is the percentage
of the material in the ``as submitted'' or original state. The percentage determined by microscopy is multiplied
by the fractions remaining after pre-preparation steps to give the percentage in the original sample. For example:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the subjective nature of asbestos analysis, certain concepts and procedures need to be discussed in more
depth. This information will help the analyst understand why some of the procedures are carried out the way they are.

4.1. Light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Light is electromagnetic energy. It travels from its source in packets called quanta. It is instructive to consider
light as a plane wave. The light has a direction of travel. Perpendicular to this and mutually perpendicular to each
other, are two vector components. One is the magnetic vector and the other is the electric vector. We shall only be concerned
with the electric vector. In this description, the interaction of the vector and the mineral will describe all the
observable phenomena. From a light source such a microscope illuminator, light travels in all different direction
from the filament. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any given direction away from the filament, the electric vector is perpendicular to the direction of travel of a
light ray. While perpendicular, its orientation is random about the travel axis. If the electric vectors from all
the light rays were lined up by passing the light through a filter that would only let light rays with electric vectors
oriented in one direction pass, the light would then be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
POLARIZED. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Polarized light interacts with matter in the direction of the electric vector. This is the polarization direction.
Using this property it is possible to use polarized light to probe different materials and identify them by how they
interact with light. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant at about 2.99&times;108 m/s. When light travels in different materials
such as air, water, minerals or oil, it does not travel at this speed. It travels slower. This slowing is a function of
both the material through which the light is traveling and the wavelength or frequency of the light. In general, the
more dense the material, the slower the light travels. Also, generally, the higher the frequency, the slower the light
will travel. The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to that in a material is called the index of refraction (n). It
is usually measured at 589 nm (the sodium D line). If white light (light containing all the visible wavelengths) travels
through a material, rays of longer wavelengths will travel faster than those of shorter wavelengths, this separation
is called dispersion. Dispersion is used as an identifier of materials as described in Section 4.6.

4.2. Material Properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Materials are either amorphous or crystalline. The difference between these two descriptions depends on the positions
of the atoms in them. The atoms in amorphous materials are randomly arranged with no long range order. An example of
an amorphous material is glass. The atoms in crystalline materials, on the other hand, are in regular arrays and have
long range order. Most of the atoms can be found in highly predictable locations. Examples of crystalline material
are salt, gold, and the asbestos minerals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is beyond the scope of this method to describe the different types of crystalline materials that can be found, or
the full description of the classes into which they can fall. However, some general crystallography is provided below
to give a foundation to the procedures described. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the exception of anthophyllite, all the asbestos minerals belong to the monoclinic crystal type. The unit cell
is the basic repeating unit of the crystal and for monoclinic crystals can be described as having three unequal sides,
two 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; angles and one angle not equal to 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;. The orthorhombic group, of which anthophyllite is a member has three unequal sides and three 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; angles. The unequal sides are a consequence of the complexity of fitting the different atoms into the unit cell.
Although the atoms are in a regular array, that array is not symmetrical in all directions. There is long range order
in the three major directions of the crystal. However, the order is different in each of the three directions. This
has the effect that the index of refraction is different in each of the three directions. Using polarized light, we
can investigate the index of refraction in each of the directions and identify the mineral or material under investigation.
The indices

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Polarized light microscopy as described in this section uses the phase-polar microscope described in Section 3.2.
A phase contrast microscope is fitted with two polarizing elements, one below and one above the sample. The polarizers
have their polarization directions at right angles to each other. Depending on the tests performed, there may be a
compensator between these two polarizing elements. A compensator is a piece of mineral with known properties that
``compensates'' for some deficiency in the optical train. Light emerging from a polarizing element has its electric
vector pointing in the polarization direction of the element. The light will not be subsequently transmitted through
a second element set at a right angle to the first element. Unless the light is altered as it passes from one element to
the other, there is no transmission of light.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Crystals which have different crystal regularity in two or three main directions are said to be anisotropic. They
have a different index of refraction in each of the main directions. When such a crystal is inserted between the crossed
polars, the field of view is no longer dark but shows the crystal in color. The color depends on the properties of the
crystal. The light acts as if it travels through the crystal along the optical axes. If a crystal optical axis were lined
up along one of the polarizing directions (either the polarizer or the analyzer) the light would appear to travel only
in that direction, and it would blink out or go dark. The difference in degrees between the fiber direction and the angle
at which it blinks out is called the angle of extinction. When this angle can be measured, it is useful in identifying
the mineral. The procedure for measuring the angle of extinction is to first identify the polarization direction
in the microscope. A commercial alignment slide can be used to establish the polarization directions or use anthophyllite
or another suitable mineral. This mineral has a zero degree angle of extinction and will go dark to extinction as it
aligns with the polarization directions. When a fiber of anthophyllite has gone to extinction, align the eyepiece
reticle or graticule with the fiber so that there is a visual cue as to the direction of polarization in the field of view.
Tape or otherwise secure the eyepiece in this position so it will not shift. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the polarization direction has been identified in the field of view, move the particle of interest to the center
of the field of view and align it with the polarization direction. For fibers, align the fiber along this direction.
Note the angular reading of the rotating stage. Looking at the particle, rotate the stage until the fiber goes dark
or ``blinks out''. Again note the reading of the stage. The difference in the first reading and the second is an angle
of extinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The angle measured may vary as the orientation of the fiber changes about its long axis. Tables of mineralogical data
usually report the maximum angle of extinction. Asbestos forming minerals, when they exhibit an angle of extinction,
usually do show an angle of extinction close to the reported maximum, or as appropriate depending on the substitution
chemistry.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When the optical axes of a crystal are not lined up along one of the polarizing directions (either the polarizer or the
analyzer) part of the light travels along one axis and part travels along the other visible axis. This is characteristic
of birefringent materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The color depends on the difference of the two visible indices of refraction and the thickness of the crystal. The maximum
difference available is the difference between the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG 0024 unknown -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 axes. This maximum difference is usually tabulated as the birefringence of the crystal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this test, align the fiber at 45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to the polarization directions in order to maximize the contribution to each of the optical axes. The colors
seen are called retardation colors. They arise from the recombination of light which has traveled through the two
separate directions of the crystal. One of the rays is retarded behind the other since the light in that direction travels
slower. On recombination, some of the colors which make up white light are enhanced by constructive interference
and some are suppressed by destructive interference. The result is a color dependent on the difference between the
indices and the thickness of the crystal. The proper colors, thicknesses, and retardations are shown on a Michel-Levy
chart. The three items, retardation, thickness and birefringence are related by the following relationship:

Examination of the equation for asbestos minerals reveals that the visible colors for almost all common asbestos
minerals and fiber sizes are shades of gray and black. The eye is relatively poor at discriminating different shades
of gray. It is very good at discriminating different colors. In order to compensate for the low retardation, a compensator
is added to the light train between the polarization elements. The compensator used for this test is a gypsum plate
of known thickness and birefringence. Such a compensator when oriented at 45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to the polarizer direction, provides a retardation of 530 nm of the 530 nm wavelength color. This enhances the
red color and gives the background a characteristic red to red-magenta color. If this ``full-wave'' compensator
is in place when the asbestos preparation is inserted into the light train, the colors seen on the fibers are quite different.
Gypsum, like asbestos has a fast axis and a slow axis. When a fiber is aligned with its fast axis in the same direction
as the fast axis of the gypsum plate, the ray vibrating in the slow direction is retarded by both the asbestos and the
gypsum. This results in a higher retardation than would be present for either of the two minerals. The color seen is
a second order blue. When the fiber is rotated 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; using the rotating stage, the slow direction of the fiber is now aligned with the fast direction of the gypsum
and the fast direction of the fiber is aligned with the slow direction of the gypsum. Thus, one ray vibrates faster in
the fast direction of the gypsum, and slower in the slow direction of the fiber; the other ray will vibrate slower in
the slow direction of the gypsum and faster in the fast direction of the fiber. In this case, the effect is subtractive
and the color seen is a first order yellow. As long as the fiber thickness does not add appreciably to the color, the same
basic colors will be seen for all asbestos types except crocidolite. In crocidolite the colors will be weaker, may
be in the opposite directions, and will be altered by the blue absorption color natural to crocidolite. Hundreds of
other materials will give the same colors as asbestos, and therefore, this test is not definitive for asbestos. The
test is useful in discriminating against fiberglass or other amorphous fibers such as some synthetic fibers. Certain
synthetic fibers will show retardation colors different than asbestos; however, there are some forms of polyethylene
and aramid which will show morphology and retardation colors similar to asbestos minerals. This test must be supplemented
with a positive identification test when birefringent fibers are present which can not be excluded by morphology.
This test is relatively ineffective for use on fibers less than 1 &mu;m in diameter. For positive confirmation TEM
or SEM should be used if no larger bundles or fibers are visible.

4.6. Dispersion Staining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Dispersion microscopy or dispersion staining is the method of choice for the identification of asbestos in bulk materials.
Becke line analysis is used by some laboratories and yields the same results as does dispersion staining for asbestos
and can be used in lieu of dispersion staining. Dispersion staining is performed on the same platform as the phase-polar
analysis with the analyzer and compensator removed. One polarizing element remains to define the direction of the
light so that the different indices of refraction of the fibers may be separately determined. Dispersion microscopy
is a dark-field technique when used for asbestos. Particles are imaged with scattered light. Light which is unscattered
is blocked from reaching the eye either by the back field image mask in a McCrone objective or a back field image mask
in the phase condenser. The most convenient method is to use the rotating phase condenser to move an oversized phase
ring into place. The ideal size for this ring is for the central disk to be just larger than the objective entry aperture
as viewed in the back focal plane. The larger the disk, the less scattered light reaches the eye. This will have the effect
of diminishing the intensity of dispersion color and will shift the actual color seen. The colors seen vary even on
microscopes from the same manufacturer. This is due to the different bands of wavelength exclusion by different mask
sizes. The mask may either reside in the condenser or in the objective back focal plane. It is imperative that the analyst
determine by experimentation with asbestos standards what the appropriate colors should be for each asbestos type.
The colors depend also on the temperature of the preparation and the exact chemistry of the asbestos. Therefore, some
slight differences from the standards should be allowed. This is not a serious problem for commercial asbestos uses.
This technique is used for identification of the indices of refraction for fibers by recognition of color. There is
no direct numerical readout of the index of refraction. Correlation of color to actual index of refraction is possible
by referral to published conversion tables. This is not necessary for the analysis of asbestos. Recognition of appropriate
colors along with the proper morphology are deemed sufficient to identify the commercial asbestos minerals. Other
techniques including SEM, TEM, and XRD may be required to provide additional information in order to identify other
types of asbestos.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Make a preparation in the suspected matching high dispersion oil, e.g., n=1.550 for chrysotile. Perform the preliminary
tests to determine whether the fibers are birefringent or not. Take note of the morphological character. Wavy fibers
are indicative of chrysotile while long, straight, thin, frayed fibers are indicative of amphibole asbestos. This
can aid in the selection of the appropriate matching oil. The microscope is set up and the polarization direction is
noted as in Section 4.4. Align a fiber with the polarization direction. Note the color. This is the color parallel to
the polarizer. Then rotate the fiber rotating the stage 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; so that the polarization direction is across the fiber. This is the perpendicular position. Again note the color.
Both colors must be consistent with standard asbestos minerals in the correct direction for a positive identification
of asbestos. If only one of the colors is correct while the other is not, the identification is not positive. If the colors
in both directions are bluish-white, the analyst has chosen a matching index oil which is higher than the correct matching
oil, e.g. the analyst has used n=1.620 where chrysotile is present. The next lower oil (Section 3.5.) should be used
to prepare another specimen. If the color in both directions is yellow-white to straw-yellow-white, this indicates
that the index of the oil is lower than the index of the fiber, e.g. the preparation is in n=1.550 while anthophyllite
is present. Select the next higher oil (Section 3.5.) and prepare another slide. Continue in this fashion until a positive
identification of all asbestos species present has been made or all possible asbestos species have been ruled out
by negative results in this test. Certain plant fibers can have similar dispersion colors as asbestos. Take care to
note and evaluate the morphology of the fibers or remove the plant fibers in pre- preparation. Coating material on
the fibers such as carbonate or vinyl may destroy the dispersion color. Usually, there will be some outcropping of
fiber which will show the colors sufficient for identification. When this is not the case, treat the sample as described
in Section 3.3. and then perform dispersion staining. Some samples will yield to Becke line analysis if they are coated
or electron microscopy can be used for identification.

(A) If feasible, the employer shall monitor employees and base the exposure assessment on the results of exposure
monitoring which is conducted pursuant to the criteria in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) In addition, the assessment shall include consideration of all observations, information or calculations which
indicate employee exposure to asbestos, including any previous monitoring conducted in the workplace, or of the
operations of the employer which indicate the levels of airborne asbestos likely to be encountered on the job. However,
the assessment may conclude that exposures are likely to be consistently below the PELs only as a conclusion of a ``negative
exposure assessment'' conducted pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) For Class I asbestos work, until the employer conducts exposure monitoring and documents that employees on that
job will not be exposed in excess of the PELs, or otherwise makes a negative exposure assessment pursuant to paragraph
(f)(2)(iii) of this section, the employer shall presume that employees are exposed in excess of the TWA and excursion
limit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Negative Initial Exposure Assessment: For any one specific asbestos job which will be performed by employees
who have been trained in compliance with the standard, the employer may demonstrate that employee exposures will
be below the PELs by data which conform to the following criteria;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Objective data demonstrating that the product or material containing asbestos minerals or the activity involving
such product or material cannot release airborne fibers in concentrations exceeding the TWA and excursion limit
under those work conditions having the greatest potential for releasing asbestos; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Where the employer has monitored prior asbestos jobs for the PEL and the excursion limit within 12 months of the
current or projected job, the monitoring and analysis were performed in compliance with the asbestos standard in
effect; and the data were obtained during work operations conducted under workplace conditions ``closely resembling''
the processes, type of material, control methods, work practices, and environmental conditions used and prevailing
in the employer's current operations, the operations were conducted by employees whose training and experience
are no more extensive than that of employees performing the current job, and these data show that under the conditions
prevailing and which will prevail in the current workplace there is a high degree of certainty that employee exposures
will not exceed the TWA and excursion limit; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The results of initial exposure monitoring of the current job made from breathing zone air samples that are representative
of the 8-hour TWA and 30-minute short-term exposures of each employee covering operations which are most likely during
the performance of the entire asbestos job to result in exposures over the PELs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Periodic monitoring. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Class I and II operations. The employer shall conduct daily monitoring that is representative of the exposure
of each employee who is assigned to work within a regulated area who is performing Class I or II work, unless the employer
pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, has made a negative exposure assessment for the entire operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) All operations under the standard other than Class I and II operations. The employer shall conduct periodic monitoring
of all work where exposures are expected to exceed a PEL, at intervals sufficient to document the validity of the exposure
prediction.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) Exception: When all employees required to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitored daily are equipped with supplied-air respirators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated in the positive-pressure mode, the employer may dispense 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the daily monitoring required by this paragraph. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees performing Class I work using a control method which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not listed in paragraph (g)(4) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section or using a modification of a listed control method, shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be monitored daily even if they are equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplied-air respirators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4)(i) Termination of monitoring. If the periodic monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by paragraph (f)(3) of this section reveals that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee exposures, as indicated by statistically reliable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement, are below the permissible exposure limit and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excursion limit the employer may discontinue monitoring for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees whose exposures are represented by such monitoring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Additional monitoring. Notwithstanding the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of paragraph (f) (2) and (3), and (f)(4) of this section, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer shall institute the exposure monitoring required under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (f)(3) of this section whenever there has been a change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in process, control equipment, personnel or work practices that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may result in new or additional exposures above the permissible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure limit and/or excursion limit or when the employer has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any reason to suspect that a change may result in new or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional exposures above the permissible exposure limit and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excursion limit. Such additional monitoring is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of whether a ``negative exposure assessment'' was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously produced for a specific job.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Observation of monitoring. (i) The employer shall provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected employees and their designated representatives an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to observe any monitoring of employee exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos conducted in accordance with this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When observation of the monitoring of employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to asbestos requires entry into an area where the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective clothing or equipment is required, the observer shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be provided with and be required to use such clothing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment and shall comply with all other applicable safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Methods of compliance_(1) Engineering controls and work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices for all operations covered by this section. The

of the levels of exposure:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Vacuum cleaners equipped with HEPA filters to collect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all debris and dust containing ACM or PACM; and,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Wet methods, or wetting agents, to control employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures during asbestos handling, mixing, removal, cutting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, and cleanup, except where employers demonstrate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of wet methods is infeasible due to for example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creation of electrical hazards, equipment malfunction, and, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
roofing, slipping hazards; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Prompt clean-up and disposal of wastes and debris 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated with asbestos in leak-tight containers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section above, the employer shall use the following control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods to achieve compliance with the TWA permissible exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit and excursion limit prescribed by paragraph (c) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated air away from the breathing zone of employees and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toward a filtration or collection device equipped with a HEPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filter; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Use of other work practices and engineering controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Assistant Secretary can show to be feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Wherever the feasible engineering and work practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls described above are not sufficient to reduce employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to or below the permissible exposure limit and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excursion limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer shall use them to reduce employee exposure to the lowest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels attainable by these controls and shall supplement them by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of respiratory protection that complies with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(C) Cutting, abrading or breaking the material shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibited unless the employer can demonstrate that methods less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to result in asbestos fiber release are not feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Asbestos-containing material removed, shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately bagged or wrapped, or kept wetted until transferred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a closed receptacle, no later than the end of the work shift. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Alternative Work Practices and Controls. Instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the work practices and controls listed in paragraphs (g)(8) (i) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through (v) of this section, the employer may use different or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified engineering and work practice controls if the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions are complied with. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The employer shall demonstrate by data representing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee exposure during the use of such method under conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which closely resemble the conditions under which the method is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be used, that employee exposure will not exceed the PELs under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any anticipated circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A qualified person shall evaluate the work area, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projected work practices and the engineering controls, and shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify in writing, that the different or modified controls are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate to reduce direct and indirect employee exposure to below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the PELs under all expected conditions of use and that the method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets the requirements of this standard. The evaluation shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include and be based on data representing employee exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the use of such method under conditions which closely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resemble the conditions under which the method is to be used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current job, and by employees whose training and experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are equivalent to employees who are to perform the current job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Work Practices and Engineering Controls for Class III 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos work. Class III asbestos work shall be conducted using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engineering and work practice controls which minimize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to employees performing the asbestos work and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bystander employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The work shall be performed using wet methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) To the extent feasible, the work shall be performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using local exhaust ventilation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Where the disturbance involves drilling, cutting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abrading, sanding, chipping, breaking, or sawing of thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system insulation or surfacing material, the employer shall use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impermeable dropcloths and shall isolate the operation using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mini-enclosures or glove bag systems pursuant to paragraph (g)(5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Where the employer does not demonstrate by a negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure assessment performed in compliance with paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f)(4)(iii) of this section that the PELs will not be exceeded, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or where monitoring results show exceedances of a PEL, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer shall contain the area using impermeable dropcloths and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plastic barriers or their equivalent, or shall isolate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation using mini-enclosure or glove bag systems pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (g)(5) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Employees performing Class III jobs which involve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disturbance of TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM or where the employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not demonstrate by a ``negative exposure assessment'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PELs will not be exceeded or where monitoring results show 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceedances of the PEL, shall wear respirators which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected, used and fitted pursuant to provisions of paragraph (h) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Class IV asbestos work. Class IV asbestos jobs shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be conducted by employees trained pursuant to the asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
awareness training program set out in paragraph (k)(8) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. In addition, all Class IV jobs shall be conducted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformity with the requirements set out in paragraph (g)(1) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, mandating wet methods, HEPA vacuums, and prompt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clean up of debris containing ACM or PACM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Employees cleaning up debris and waste in a regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area where respirators are required shall wear respirators which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are selected, used and fitted pursuant to provisions of paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Employers of employees cleaning up waste and debris in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an area where friable TSI or surfacing ACM/PACM is accessible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall assume that such waste and debris contain asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Specific compliance methods for brake and clutch repair: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Engineering controls and work practices for brake and clutch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repair and service. During automotive brake and clutch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection, disassembly, repair and assembly operations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer shall institute engineering controls and work practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to reduce employee exposure to materials containing asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using a negative pressure enclosure/HEPA vacuum system method or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low pressure/wet cleaning method, which meets the detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements set out in Appendix L to this section. The employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may also comply using an equivalent method which follows written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures which the employer demonstrates can achieve results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to Method A. For facilities in which no more than 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pair of brakes or 5 clutches are inspected, disassembled, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repaired, or assembled per week, the method set for in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[D] of Appendix L to this section may be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The employer may also comply by using an equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method which follows written procedures, which the employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates can achieve equivalent exposure reductions as do the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two ``preferred methods.'' Such demonstration must include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring data conducted under workplace conditions closely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resembling the process, type of asbestos containing materials, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control method, work practices and environmental conditions which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the equivalent method will be used, or objective data, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document that under all reasonably foreseeable conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake and clutch repair applications, the method results in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures which are equivalent to the methods set out in Appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) In addition to the above selection criterion, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer shall provide a half-mask air purifying respirator, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than a disposable respirator, equipped with high efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filters whenever the employee performs the following activities: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class II and III asbestos jobs where the employer does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce a negative exposure assessment; and Class III jobs where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM is being disturbed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) In addition to the above selection criteria, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer shall provide a full facepiece supplied air respirator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated in the pressure demand mode equipped with an auxiliar76y 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees within the regulated area where Class I work is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed for which a negative exposure assessment has not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Respirator program. (i) Where respiratory protection is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used, the employer shall institute a respirator program in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with 29 CFR 1910.134(b), (d), (e), and (f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The employer shall permit each employee who uses a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filter respirator to change the filter elements whenever an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in breathing resistance is detected and shall maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an adequate supply of filter elements for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Employees who wear respirators shall be permitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leave work areas to wash their faces and respirator facepieces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whenever necessary to prevent skin irritation associated with

examination, an examining physician determines that the employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be unable to function normally wearing a respirator, or that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the safety or health of the employee or of other employees will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be impaired by the use of a respirator. Such employee shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned to another job or given the opportunity to transfer to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different position the duties of which he or she is able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform with the same employer, in the same geographical area, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and with the same seniority, status, and rate of pay and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
job benefits he or she had just prior to such transfer, if such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different position is available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Respirator fit testing. (i) The employer shall ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the respirator issued to the employee exhibits the least possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facepiece leakage and that the respirator is fitted properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Employers shall perform either quantitative or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualitative face fit tests at the time of initial fitting and at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least every 6 months thereafter for each employee wearing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative-pressure respirator. The qualitative fit tests may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used only for testing the fit of half-mask respirators where they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are permitted to be worn, or of full-facepiece air purifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirators where they are worn at levels at which half-facepiece 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air purifying respirators are permitted. Qualitative and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative fit tests shall be conducted in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix C of this section. The tests shall be used to select 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facepieces that provide the required protection as prescribed in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over 25 linear or 10 square feet of TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employer shall establish a decontamination area that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjacent and connected to the regulated area for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decontamination of such employees. The decontamination area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall consist of an equipment room, shower area, and clean room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in series. The employer shall ensure that employees enter and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exit the regulated area through the decontamination area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Equipment room. The equipment room shall be supplied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

feasible to provide a clean change area adjacent to the work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, or where the work is performed outdoors, or when the work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takes place aboard a ship, the employer may permit employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in Class I asbestos jobs to clean their protective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clothing with a portable HEPA-equipped vacuum before such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees leave the regulated area. Such employees however must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then change into street clothing in clean change areas provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the employer which otherwise meet the requirements of this

This section applies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the communication of information concerning asbestos hazards in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipyard employment activities to facilitate compliance with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. Most asbestos-related shipyard activities involve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously installed building materials. Building/vessel owners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
often are the only and/or best sources of information concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them. Therefore, they, along with employers of potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed employees, are assigned specific information conveying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and retention duties under this section. Installed Asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Containing Building/Vessel Material: Employers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building/vessel owners are required to treat TSI and sprayed or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
troweled on surfacing materials as asbestos-containing unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer, by complying with paragraph (k)(4) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that the material is not asbestos-containing. Asphalt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or vinyl flooring/decking material installed in buildings or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels no later than 1980 must also be considered as asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing unless the employer/owner, pursuant to paragraph (g), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section determines it is not asbestos containing. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer or building/vessel owner has actual knowledge or should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have known, through the exercise of due diligence, that materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than TSI and sprayed-on or troweled-on surfacing materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are asbestos-containing, they must be treated as such. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communicating information to employees pursuant to this standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners and employers shall identify ``PACM'' as ACM. Additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements relating to communication of asbestos work on multi- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer worksites are set out in paragraph (d) of this standard.

work subject to this standard is begun, building/vessel and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility owners shall identify the presence, location and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity of ACM, and/or PACM at the work site. All thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system insulation and sprayed on or troweled on surfacing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials in buildings/vessels or substrates constructed no later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 1980 shall be identified as PACM. In addition, resilient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flooring/decking material installed no later than 1980 shall also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be identified as asbestos-containing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Building/vessel and/or facility owners shall notify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following persons of the presence, location and quantity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACM or PACM, at work sites in their buildings/facilities/vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notification either shall be in writing or shall consist of a

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) Employees of the owner who will work in or adjacent to areas containing such material: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) On multi-employer worksites, all employers of employees who will be performing work within or adjacent to areas
containing such materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Tenants who will occupy areas containing such materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Duties of employers whose employees perform work subject to this standard in or adjacent to areas containing ACM
and PACM. Building/vessel and facility owners whose employees perform such work shall comply with these provisions
to the extent applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Before work in areas containing ACM and PACM is begun, employers shall identify the presence, location, and quantity
of ACM, and/or PACM therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Before work under this standard is performed employers of employees who will perform such work shall inform the
following persons of the location and quantity of ACM and/or PACM present at the work site and the precautions to be
taken to insure that airborne asbestos is confined to the area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Owners of the building/vessel or facility; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Employees who will perform such work and employers of employees who work and/or will be working in adjacent areas;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Within 10 days of the completion of such work, the employer whose employees have performed work subject to this
standard, shall inform the building/vessel or facility owner and employers of employees who will be working in the
area of the current location and quantity of PACM and/or ACM remaining in the former regulated area and final monitoring
results, if any.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In addition to the above requirements, all employers who discover ACM and/or PACM on a work site shall convey information
concerning the presence, location and quantity of such newly discovered ACM and/or PACM to the owner and to other employers
of employees working at the work site, within 24 hours of the discovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Criteria to rebut the designation of installed material as PACM. (i) At any time, an employer and/or building/vessel
owner may demonstrate, for purposes of this standard, that PACM does not contain asbestos. Building/vessel owners
and/or employers are not required to communicate information about the presence of building material for which such
a demonstration pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section has been made. However, in all
such cases, the information, data and analysis supporting the determination that PACM does not contain asbestos,
shall be retained pursuant to paragraph (n) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An employer or owner may demonstrate that PACM does not contain asbestos by the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Having a completed inspection conducted pursuant to the requirements of AHERA (40 CFR Part 763, Subpart E) which
demonstrates that the material is not ACM; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Performing tests of the material containing PACM which demonstrate that no asbestos is present in the material.
Such tests shall include analysis of 3 bulk samples of each homogeneous area of PACM collected in a randomly distributed
manner. The tests, evaluation and sample collection shall be conducted by an accredited inspector or by a CIH. Analysis
of samples shall be performed by persons or laboratories with proficiency demonstrated by current successful participation
in a nationally recognized testing program such as the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP)
of the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) of the Round Robin for bulk samples administered by
the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), or an equivalent nationally-recognized round robin testing
program..
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) At the entrance to mechanical rooms/areas in which employees reasonably can be expected to enter and which contain
TSI or surfacing ACM and PACM, the building/vessel owner shall post signs which identify the material which is present,
its location, and appropriate work practices which, if followed, will ensure that ACM and/or PACM will not be disturbed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Signs. (i) Warning signs that demarcate the regulated area shall be provided and displayed at each location where
a regulated area is required to be established by paragraph (e) of this section. Signs shall be posted at such a distance
from such a location that an employee may read the signs and take necessary protective steps before entering the area
marked by the signs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The warning signs required by (k)(6) of this section shall bear the following information.

where:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Asbestos fibers have been modified by a bonding agent, coating, binder, or other material, provided that the manufacturer
can demonstrate that, during any reasonably foreseeable use, handling, storage, disposal, processing, or transportation,
no airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers in excess of the permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit
will be released, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Asbestos is present in a product in concentrations less than 1.0 percent by weight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) When a building/vessel owner/or employer identifies previously installed PACM and/or ACM, labels or signs
shall be affixed or posted so that employees will be notified of what materials contain PACM and/or ACM. The employer
shall attach such labels in areas where they will clearly be noticed by employees who are likely to be exposed, such
as at the entrance to mechanical rooms/areas. Signs required by paragraph (k)(5) of this section may be posted in lieu
of labels so long as they contain information required for labelling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Employee information and training. (i) The employer shall, at no cost to the employee,institute a training program
for all employees who install asbestos containing products and for all employees who perform Class I through IV asbestos

whose Class II work with asbestos-containing material involves only the removal and/or disturbance of one generic
category of building/vessel material, such as roofing materials, flooring/deck materials, siding materials or
transite panels, instead, such employer is required to train employees who perform such work by providing a training
course which includes as a minimum all the elements included in paragraph (k)(8)(v) of this section and in addition,
the specific work practices and engineering controls set forth in paragraph (g) of this section which specifically
relate to that material category. Such course shall include ``hands-on'' training and shall take at least 8 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Training for Class III employees shall be the equivalent in curriculum and training method to the 16-hour Operations
and Maintenance course developed by EPA for maintenance and custodial workers who conduct activities that will result
in the disturbance of ACM. [See 40 CFR 763.92(a)(2)]. Such course shall include ``hands-on'' training in the use of
respiratory protection and work practices and shall take at least 16 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Training for employees performing Class IV operations shall be the equivalent in curriculum and training method
to the awareness training course developed by EPA for maintenance and custodial workers who work in buildings containing
asbestos- containing material. (See 40 CFR 763.92 (a)(1)). Such course shall include available information concerning
the locations of PACM and ACM, and asbestos-containing flooring material, or flooring material where the absence
of asbestos has not been certified; and instruction in recognition of damage, deterioration, and delamination of
asbestos containing building materials. Such course shall take at least 2 hours.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The training program shall be conducted in a manner that the employee is able to understand. In addition to the
content required by provisions in paragraph (k)(8)(iii) of this section, the employer shall ensure that each such
employee is informed of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Methods of recognizing asbestos, including the requirement in paragraph (k)(1) of this section to presume that
certain building materials contain asbestos.;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The health effects associated with asbestos exposure;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Appendix A to &sect;1915.1001. OSHA Reference Method._Mandatory
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This mandatory appendix specifies the procedure for analyzing air samples for asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite,
and actinolite and specifies quality control procedures that must be implemented by laboratories performing the
analysis. The sampling and analytical methods described below represent the elements of the available monitoring
methods (such as appendix B to this section, the most current version of the OSHA method ID&hyph;60, or the most current
version of the NIOSH 7400 method) which OSHA considers to be essential to achieve adequate employee exposure monitoring
while allowing employers to use methods that are already established within their organizations. All employers
who are required to conduct air monitoring under paragraph (f) of this section are required to utilize analytical
laboratories that use this procedure, or an equivalent method, for collecting and analyzing samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Sampling and Analytical Procedure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The sampling medium for air samples shall be mixed cellulose ester filter membranes. These shall be designated
by the manufacturer as suitable for asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite counting. See below for
rejection of blanks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The preferred collection device shall be the 25-mm diameter cassette with an open-faced 50-mm extension cowl.
The 37-mm cassette may be used if necessary but only if written justification for the need to use the 37-mm filter cassette
accompanies the sample results in the employee's exposure monitoring record. Do not reuse or reload cassettes for
asbestos sample collection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. An air flow rate between 0.5 liter/min and 2.5 liters/min shall be selected for the 25-mm cassette. If the 37-mm cassette
is used, an air flow rate between 1 liter/min and 2.5 liters/min shall be selected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Where possible, a sufficient air volume for each air sample shall be collected to yield between 100 and 1,300 fibers
per square millimeter on the membrane filter. If a filter darkens in appearance or if loose dust is seen on the filter,
a second sample shall be started.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Ship the samples in a rigid container with sufficient packing material to prevent dislodging the collected fibers.
Packing material that has a high electrostatic charge on its surface (e.g., expanded polystyrene) cannot be used
because such material can cause loss of fibers to the sides of the cassette.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Calibrate each personal sampling pump before and after use with a representative filter cassette installed between
the pump and the calibration devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Personal samples shall be taken in the ``breathing zone'' of the employee (i.e., attached to or near the collar or
lapel near the worker's face).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Fiber counts shall be made by positive phase contrast using a microscope with an 8 to 10 X eyepiece and a 40 to 45 X objective
for a total magnification of approximately 400 X and a numerical aperture of 0.65 to 0.75. The microscope shall also
be fitted with a green or blue filter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The microscope shall be fitted with a Walton-Beckett eyepiece graticule calibrated for a field diameter of 100
micrometers (+/^ 2 micrometers).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The phase-shift detection limit of the microscope shall be about 3 degrees measured using the HSE phase shift test
slide as outlined below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Place the test slide on the microscope stage and center it under the phase objective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Bring the blocks of grooved lines into focus. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The slide consists of seven sets of grooved lines (ca. 20 grooves to each block) in descending order of visibility from
sets 1 to 7, seven being the least visible. The requirements for asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite
counting are that the microscope optics must resolve the grooved lines in set 3 completely, although they may appear
somewhat faint, and that the grooved lines in sets 6 and 7 must be invisible. Sets 4 and 5 must be at least partially visible
but may vary slightly in visibility between microscopes. A microscope that fails to meet these requirements has either
too low or too high a resolution to be used for asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite counting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. If the image deteriorates, clean and adjust the microscope optics. If the problem persists, consult the microscope
manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Each set of samples taken will include 10 percent blanks or a minimum of 2 blanks. These blanks must come from the
same lot as the filters used for sample collection. The field blank results shall be averaged and subtracted from the
analytical results before reporting. Any samples represented by a blank having a fiber count in excess of the detection
limit of the method being used shall be rejected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The samples shall be mounted by the acetone/triacetin method or a method with an equivalent index of refraction
and similar clarity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Observe the following counting rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Count only fibers equal to or longer than 5 micrometers. Measure the length of curved fibers along the curve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Count all particles as asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite that have a length-to-width ratio
(aspect ratio) of 3:1 or greater.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Fibers lying entirely within the boundary of the Walton-Beckett graticule field shall receive a count of 1. Fibers
crossing the boundary once, having one end within the circle, shall receive the count of one half (1/2). Do not count
any fiber that crosses the graticule boundary more than once. Reject and do not count any other fibers even though they
may be visible outside the graticule area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Count bundles of fibers as one fiber unless individual fibers can be identified by observing both ends of an individual
fiber.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Count enough graticule fields to yield 100 fibers. Count a minimum of 20 fields; stop counting at 100 fields regardless
of fiber count.

Quality Control Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Intra-laboratory program. Each laboratory and/or each company with more than one microscopist counting slides
shall establish a statistically designed quality assurance program involving blind recounts and comparisons between
microscopists to monitor the variability of counting by each microscopist and between microscopists. In a company
with more than one laboratory, the program shall include all laboratories and shall also evaluate the laboratory-to-laboratory
variability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. a. Interlaboratory program. Each laboratory analyzing asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite
samples for compliance determination shall implement an interlaboratory quality assurance program that as a minimum
includes participation of at least two other independent laboratories. Each laboratory shall participate in round
robin testing at least once every 6 months with at least all the other laboratories in its interlaboratory quality
assurance group. Each laboratory shall submit slides typical of its own work load for use in this program. The round
robin shall be designed and results analyzed using appropriate statistical methodology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. All laboratories should participate in a national sample testing scheme such as the Proficiency Analytical Testing
Program (PAT), the Asbestos Registry sponsored by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. All individuals performing asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite analysis must have taken the
NIOSH course for sampling and evaluating airborne asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite dust or an
equivalent course.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. When the use of different microscopes contributes to differences between counters and laboratories, the effect
of the different microscope shall be evaluated and the microscope shall be replaced, as necessary.

1. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This method describes the collection of airborne asbestos fibers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using calibrated sampling pumps with mixed-cellulose ester (MCE) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filters and analysis by phase contrast microscopy (PCM). Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms used are unique to this method and are defined below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Asbestos: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A term for naturally occurring fibrous minerals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos includes chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(cummingtonite-grunerite asbestos), tremolite asbestos, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actinolite asbestos, anthophyllite asbestos, and any of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minerals that have been chemically treated and/or altered. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precise chemical formulation of each species will vary with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location from which it was mined. Nominal compositions are

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.1. History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Early surveys to determine asbestos exposures were conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using impinger counts of total dust with the counts expressed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million particles per cubic foot. The British Asbestos Research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council recommended filter membrane counting in 1969. In July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1969, the Bureau of Occupational Safety and Health published a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filter membrane method for counting asbestos fibers in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. This method was refined by NIOSH and published as P &amp; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CAM 239. On May 29, 1971, OSHA specified filter membrane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling with phase contrast counting for evaluation of asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures at work sites in the United States. The use of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technique was again required by OSHA in 1986. Phase contrast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopy has continued to be the method of choice for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement of occupational exposure to asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.2. Principle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Air is drawn through a MCE filter to capture airborne asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers. A wedge shaped portion of the filter is removed, placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a glass microscope slide and made transparent. A measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area (field) is viewed by PCM. All the fibers meeting a defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for asbestos are counted and considered a measure of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airborne asbestos concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.3. Advantages and Disadvantages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
There are four main advantages of PCM over other methods: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The technique is specific for fibers. Phase contrast is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber counting technique which excludes non-fibrous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particles from the analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The technique is inexpensive and does not require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specialized knowledge to carry out the analysis for total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber counts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The analysis is quick and can be performed on-site for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rapid determination of air concentrations of asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The technique has continuity with historical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epidemiological studies so that estimates of expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease can be inferred from long-term determinations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The main disadvantage of PCM is that it does not positively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify asbestos fibers. Other fibers which are not asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be included in the count unless differential counting is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed. This requires a great deal of experience to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately differentiate asbestos from non-asbestos fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Positive identification of asbestos must be performed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polarized light or electron microscopy techniques. A further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disadvantage of PCM is that the smallest visible fibers are about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.2 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m in diameter while the finest asbestos fibers may be as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small as 0.02 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m in diameter. For some exposures, substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more fibers may be present than are actually counted.

1.4. Workplace Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos is used by the construction industry in such products as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shingles, floor tiles, asbestos cement, roofing felts, insulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and acoustical products. Non-construction uses include brakes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clutch facings, paper, paints, plastics, and fabrics. One of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most significant exposures in the workplace is the removal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encapsulation of asbestos in schools, public buildings, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
homes. Many workers have the potential to be exposed to asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during these operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
About 95% of the asbestos in commercial use in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States is chrysotile. Crocidolite and amosite make up most of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the remainder. Anthophyllite and tremolite or actinolite are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to be encountered as contaminants in various industrial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products.

1.5. Physical Properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos fiber possesses a high tensile strength along its axis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is chemically inert, non-combustible, and heat resistant. It has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a high electrical resistance and good sound absorbing properties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It can be weaved into cables, fabrics or other textiles, and also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matted into asbestos papers, felts, or mats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Range and Detection Limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
2.1. The ideal counting range on the filter is 100 to 1,300 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers/mm
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. With a Walton-Beckett graticule this range is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to 0.8 to 10 fibers/field. Using NIOSH counting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistics, a count of 0.8 fibers/field would give an approximate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.13. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.2. The detection limit for this method is 4.0 fibers per 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fields or 5.5 fibers/mm
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. This was determined using an equation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to estimate the maximum CV possible at a specific concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(95% confidence) and a Lower Control Limit of zero. The CV value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was then used to determine a corresponding concentration from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical CV vs fiber relationships. As an example: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
Lower Control Limit (95% Confidence) = AC_1.645(CV)(AC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
AC = Estimate of the airborne fiber concentration (fibers/cc) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Setting the Lower Control Limit = 0 and solving for CV: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0 = AC_1.645(CV)(AC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CV = 0.61 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This value was compared with CV vs. count curves. The count at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which CV = 0.61 for Leidel-Busch counting statistics (8.9.) or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an OSHA Salt Lake Technical Center (OSHA-SLTC) CV curve (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A for further information) was 4.4 fibers or 3.9 fibers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per 100 fields, respectively. Although a lower detection limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 4 fibers per 100 fields is supported by the OSHA-SLTC data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both data sets support the 4.5 fibers per 100 fields value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Method Performance_Precision and Accuracy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Precision is dependent upon the total number of fibers counted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the uniformity of the fiber distribution on the filter. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general rule is to count at least 20 and not more than 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fields. The count is discontinued when 100 fibers are counted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that 20 fields have already been counted. Counting more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 100 fibers results in only a small gain in precision. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total count drops below 10 fibers, an accelerated loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precision is noted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, there is no known method to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absolute accuracy of the asbestos analysis. Results of samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared through the Proficiency Analytical Testing (PAT) Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and analyzed by the OSHA-SLTC showed no significant bias when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compared to PAT reference values. The PAT samples were analyzed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 1987 to 1989 (N=36) and the concentration range was from 120 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 1,300 fibers/mm

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
5.2.3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Connect each pump to a calibration cassette with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate length of 6-mm bore plastic tubing. Do not use luer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connectors_the type of cassette specified above has built-in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
5.2.4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Select an appropriate flow rate for the situation being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitored. The sampling flow rate must be between 0.5 and 5.0 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
L/min for personal sampling and is commonly set between 1 and 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
L/min. Always choose a flow rate that will not produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overloaded filters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
5.2.5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Calibrate each sampling pump before and after sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a calibration cassette in-line (Note: This calibration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cassette should be from the same lot of cassettes used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling). Use a primary standard (e.g. bubble burette) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibrate each pump. If possible, calibrate at the sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If sampling site calibration is not possible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental influences may affect the flow rate. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent is dependent on the type of pump used. Consult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the pump manufacturer to determine dependence on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental influences. If the pump is affected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature and pressure changes, use the formula in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Connect each pump to the base of each sampling cassette 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with flexible tubing. Remove the end cap of each cassette and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take each air sample open face. Assure that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample cassette is held open side down in the employee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breathing zone during sampling. The distance from the nose/mouth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the employee to the cassette should be about 10 cm. Secure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cassette on the collar or lapel of the employee using spring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clips or other similar devices.

Caution: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Do not overload the filter with dust. High levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-fibrous dust particles may obscure fibers on the filter and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower the count or make counting impossible. If more than about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25 to 30% of the field area is obscured with dust, the result may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be biased low. Smaller air volumes may be necessary when there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is excessive non-asbestos dust in the air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While sampling, observe the filter with a small flashlight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there is a visible layer of dust on the filter, stop sampling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove and seal the cassette, and replace with a new sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembly. The total dust loading should not exceed 1 mg.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Blank samples are used to determine if any contamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has occurred during sample handling. Prepare two blanks for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first 1 to 20 samples. For sets containing greater than 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples, prepare blanks as 10% of the samples. Handle blank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples in the same manner as air samples with one exception: Do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not draw any air through the blank samples. Open the blank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cassette in the place where the sample cassettes are mounted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employee. Hold it open for about 30 seconds. Close and seal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cassette appropriately. Store blanks for shipment with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample cassettes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
5.2.10. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Immediately after sampling, close and seal each cassette 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the base and plastic plugs. Do not touch or puncture the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filter membrane as this will invalidate the analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
5.2.11. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Attach a seal (OSHA&hyph;21 or equivalent) around each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cassette in such a way as to secure the end cap plug and base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plug. Tape the ends of the seal together since the seal is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long enough to be wrapped end-to-end. Also wrap tape around the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cassette at each joint to keep the seal secure.

Acetone is extremely flammable and precautions must be taken not to ignite it. Avoid using large containers or quantities
of acetone. Transfer the solvent in a ventilated laboratory hood. Do not use acetone near any open flame. For generation
of acetone vapor, use a spark free heat source.

Any asbestos spills should be cleaned up immediately to prevent dispersal of fibers. Prudence should be exercised
to avoid contamination of laboratory facilities or exposure of personnel to asbestos. Asbestos spills should be
cleaned up with wet methods and/or a High Efficiency Particulate-Air (HEPA) filtered vacuum.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A way to prepare standard asbestos samples of known concentration has not been developed. It is possible to prepare
replicate samples of nearly equal concentration. This has been performed through the PAT program. These asbestos
samples are distributed by the AIHA to participating laboratories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since only about one-fourth of a 25-mm sample membrane is required for an asbestos count, any PAT sample can serve as
a ``standard'' for replicate counting.

See Safety Precautions in Section 6.1. before proceeding. The objective is to produce samples with a smooth (non-grainy)
background in a medium with a refractive index of approximately 1.46. The technique below collapses the filter for
easier focusing and produces permanent mounts which are useful for quality control and interlaboratory comparison.

pieces. DO NOT TOUCH the filter with your finger. Place the filter on the glass slide sample side up. Static electricity
will usually keep the filter on the slide until it is cleared.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

6.6.1. Alignment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Clean all optical surfaces. Even a small amount of dirt can significantly degrade the image. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Rough focus the objective on a sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Close down the field iris so that it is visible in the field of view. Focus the image of the iris with the condenser
focus. Center the image of the iris in the field of view. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Install the phase telescope and focus on the phase rings. Critically center the rings. Misalignment of the rings
results in astigmatism which will degrade the image. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Place the phase-shift test slide on the microscope stage and focus on the lines. The analyst must see line set 3 and
should see at least parts of 4 and 5 but, not see line set 6 or 6. A microscope/microscopist combination which does not
pass this test may not be used.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
6.6.2. Counting Fibers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Place the prepared sample slide on the mechanical stage of the microscope. Position the center of the wedge under
the objective lens and focus upon the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Start counting from one end of the wedge and progress along a radial line to the other end (count in either direction
from perimeter to wedge tip). Select fields randomly, without looking into the eyepieces, by slightly advancing
the slide in one direction with the mechanical stage control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Continually scan over a range of focal planes (generally the upper 10 to 15 &mu;m of the filter surface) with the
fine focus control during each field count. Spend at least 5 to 15 seconds per field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Most samples will contain asbestos fibers with fiber diameters less than 1 &mu;m. Look carefully for faint fiber
images. The small diameter fibers will be very hard to see. However, they are an important contribution to the total
count. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Count only fibers equal to or longer than 5 &mu;m. Measure the length of curved fibers along the curve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Count fibers which have a length to width ratio of 3:1 or greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Count all the fibers in at least 20 fields. Continue counting until either 100 fibers are counted or 100 fields have
been viewed; whichever occurs first. Count all the fibers in the final field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Fibers lying entirely within the boundary of the Walton-Beckett graticule field shall receive a count of 1. Fibers
crossing the boundary once, having one end within the circle shall receive a count of 1/2. Do not count any fiber that
crosses the graticule boundary more than once. Reject and do not count any other fibers even though they may be visible
outside the graticule area. If a fiber touches the circle, it is considered to cross the line.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(9) Count bundles of fibers as one fiber unless individual fibers can be clearly identified and each individual fiber
is clearly not connected to another counted fiber. See Figure 2 for counting conventions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Record the number of fibers in each field in a consistent way such that filter non-uniformity can be assessed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Regularly check phase ring alignment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) When an agglomerate (mass of material) covers more than 25% of the field of view, reject the field and select another.
Do not include it in the number of fields counted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) Perform a ``blind recount'' of 1 in every 10 filter wedges (slides). Re-label the slides using a person other than
the original counter.

6.7. Fiber Identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously mentioned in Section 1.3., PCM does not provide positive confirmation of asbestos fibers. Alternate
differential counting techniques should be used if discrimination is desirable. Differential counting may include
primary discrimination based on morphology, polarized light analysis of fibers, or modification of PCM data by Scanning
Electron or Transmission Electron Microscopy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A great deal of experience is required to routinely and correctly perform differential counting. It is discouraged
unless it is legally necessary. Then, only if a fiber is obviously not asbestos should it be excluded from the count.
Further discussion of this technique can be found in reference 8.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there is a question whether a fiber is asbestos or not, follow the rule:

Each analyst shall select and count prepared slides from a ``slide bank''. These are quality assurance counts. The
slide bank shall be prepared using uniformly distributed samples taken from the workload. Fiber densities should
cover the entire range routinely analyzed by the laboratory. These slides are counted blind by all counters to establish
an original standard deviation. This historical distribution is compared with the quality assurance counts. A counter
must have 95% of all quality control samples counted within three standard deviations of the historical mean. This
count is then integrated into a new historical mean and standard deviation for the slide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The collection area of a filter is seldom equal to 385 mm2. It is appropriate for laboratories to routinely monitor
the exact diameter using an inside micrometer. The collection area is calculated according to the formula: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Area =

7.2. Short-cut Calculation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since a given analyst always has the same interpupillary distance, the number of fields per filter for a particular
analyst will remain constant for a given size filter. The field size for that analyst is constant (i.e. the analyst
is using an assigned microscope and is not changing the reticle). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if the exposed area of the filter is always 385 mm2 and the size of the field is always 0.00785 mm2, the number
of fields per filter will always be 49,000. In addition it is necessary to convert liters of air to cc. These three constants
can then be combined such that ECA/(1,000 X MFA) = 49. The previous equation simplifies to:

7.3. Recount Calculations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned in step 13 of Section 6.6.2., a ``blind recount'' of 10% of the slides is performed. In all cases, differences
will be observed between the first and second counts of the same filter wedge. Most of these differences will be due
to chance alone, that is, due to the random variability (precision) of the count method. Statistical recount criteria
enables one to decide whether observed differences can be explained due to chance alone or are probably due to systematic
differences between analysts, microscopes, or other biasing factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following recount criterion is for a pair of counts that estimate AC in fibers/cc. The criterion is given at the
type-I error level. That is, there is 5% maximum risk that we will reject a pair of counts for the reason that one might
be biased, when the large observed difference is really due to chance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Quality Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The OSHA asbestos regulations require each laboratory to establish a quality control program. The following is presented
as an example of how the OSHA&hyph;SLTC constructed its internal CV curve as part of meeting this requirement. Data
for the CV curve shown below is from 395 samples collected during OSHA compliance inspections and analyzed from October
1980 through April 1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each sample was counted by 2 to 5 different counters independently of one another. The standard deviation and the CV
statistic was calculated for each sample. This data was then plotted on a graph of CV vs. fibers/mm2. A least squares
regression was performed using the following equation:

I. Isoamyl Acetate Protocol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
A. Odor threshold screening. 1. Three 1-liter glass jars with metal lids (e.g. Mason or Bell jars) are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Odor-free water (e.g. distilled or spring water) at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 25 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C shall be used for the solutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The isoamyl acetate (IAA) (also known as isopentyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acetate) stock solution is prepared by adding 1 cc of pure IAA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
800 cc of odor free water in a 1-liter jar and shaking for 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seconds. This solution shall be prepared new at least weekly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The screening test shall be conducted in a room separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the room used for actual fit testing. The two rooms shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be well ventilated but shall not be connected to the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recirculating ventilation system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The odor test solution is prepared in a second jar by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placing 0.4 cc of the stock solution into 500 cc of odor free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water using a clean dropper or pipette. Shake for 30 seconds and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow to stand for two to three minutes so that the IAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration above the liquid may reach equilibrium. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solution may be used for only one day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
6. A test blank is prepared in a third jar by adding 500 cc of odor free water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The odor test and test blank jars shall be labelled 1 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 for jar identification. If the labels are put on the lids they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be periodically peeled, dried off and switched to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the integrity of the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The following instructions shall be typed on a card and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed on the table in front of the two test jars (i.e. 1 and 2): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``The purpose of this test is to determine if you can smell banana 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oil at a low concentration. The two bottles in front of you 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain water. One of these bottles also contains a small amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of banana oil. Be sure the covers are on tight, then shake each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bottle for two seconds. Unscrew the lid of each bottle, one at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, and sniff at the mouth of the bottle. Indicate to the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conductor which bottle contains banana oil.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The mixtures used in the IAA odor detection test shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared in an area separate from where the test is performed, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to prevent olfactory fatigue in the subject. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. If the test subject is unable to correctly identify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jar containing the odor test solution, the IAA qualitative fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test may not be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. If the test subject correctly identifies the jar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing the odor test solution, the test subject may proceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to respirator selection and fit testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Respirator Selection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The test subject shall be allowed to pick the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comfortable respirator from a selection including respirators of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various sizes from different manufacturers. The selection shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include at least five sizes of elastomeric half facepieces, from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least two manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The selection process shall be conducted in a room 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate from the fit-test chamber to prevent odor fatigue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the selection process, the test subject shall be shown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how to put on a respirator, how it should be positioned on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
face, how to set strap tension and how to determine a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``comfortable'' respirator. A mirror shall be available to assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the subject in evaluating the fit and positioning of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator. This instruction may not constitute the subject's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formal training on respirator use, as it is only a review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The test subject should understand that the employee is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being asked to select the respirator which provides the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comfortable fit. Each respirator represents a different size and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shape and, if fit properly and used properly will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The test subject holds each facepiece up to the face and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminates those which obviously do not give a comfortable fit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, selection will begin with a half-mask and if a good fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be found, the subject will be asked to test the full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facepiece respirators. (A small percentage of users will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to wear any half-mask.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The more comfortable facepieces are noted; the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comfortable mask is donned and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
worn at least five minutes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assess comfort. All donning and adjustments of the facepiece 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be performed by the test subject without assistance from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test conductor or other person. Assistance in assessing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comfort can be given by discussing the points in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
6 below. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test subject is not familiar with using a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator, the test subject shall be directed to don the mask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several times and to adjust the straps each time to become adept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at setting proper tension on the straps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Assessment of comfort shall include reviewing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following points with the test subject and allowing the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject adequate time to determine the comfort of the respirator: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Positioning of mask on nose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Room for eye protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Room to talk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Positioning mask on face and cheeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The following criteria shall be used to help determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequacy of the respirator fit: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Chin properly placed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Strap tension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fit across nose bridge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Distance from nose to chin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Tendency to slip. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Self-observation in mirror. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
8. The test subject shall conduct the conventional negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and positive-pressure fit checks (e.g. see ANSI Z88.2&hyph;1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before conducting the negative- or positive-pressure test the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject shall be told to ``seat'' the mask by rapidly moving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
head from side-to-side and up and down, while taking a few deep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breaths. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The test subject is now ready for fit testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. After passing the fit test, the test subject shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questioned again regarding the comfort of the respirator. If it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has become uncomfortable, another model of respirator shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tried. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The employee shall be given the opportunity to select a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different facepiece and be retested if the chosen facepiece 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
becomes increasingly uncomfortable at any time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. Fit test. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The fit test chamber shall be similar to a clear 55 gal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drum liner suspended inverted over a 2 foot diameter frame, so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the top of the chamber is about 6 inches above the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject's head. The inside top center of the chamber shall have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a small hook attached. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Each respirator used for the fitting and fit testing shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be equipped with organic vapor cartridges or offer protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against organic vapors. The cartridges or masks shall be changed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least weekly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. After selecting, donning, and properly adjusting a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator, the test subject shall wear it to the fit testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
room. This room shall be separate from the room used for odor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold screening and respirator selection, and shall be well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ventilated, as by an exhaust fan or lab hood, to prevent general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
room contamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A copy of the following test exercises and rainbow passage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be taped to the inside of the test chamber: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Test Exercises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
i. Breathe normally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Breathe deeply. Be certain breaths are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
deep 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
regular. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. Turn head all the way from one side to the other. Inhale on each side. Be certain movement is complete. Do not bump
the respirator against the shoulders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. Nod head up-and-down. Inhale when head is in the full up position (looking toward ceiling). Be certain motions
are complete and made about every second. Do not bump the respirator on the chest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
v. Talking. Talk aloud and slowly for several minutes. The following paragraph is called the Rainbow Passage. Reading
it will result in a wide range of facial movements, and thus be useful to satisfy this requirement. Alternative passages
which serve the same purpose may also be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vi. Jogging in place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vii. Breathe normally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=3 -->
Rainbow Passage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a man looks for something beyond reach, his friends say he is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Each test subject shall wear the respirator for at a least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 minutes before starting the fit test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Upon entering the test chamber, the test subject shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given a 6 inch by 5 inch piece of paper towel or other porous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absorbent single ply material, folded in half and wetted with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three-quarters of one cc of pure IAA. The test subject shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hang the wet towel on the hook at the top of the chamber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Allow two minutes for the IAA test concentration to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reached before starting the fit-test exercises. This would be an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate time to talk with the test subject, to explain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fit test, the importance of cooperation, the purpose for the head 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercises, or to demonstrate some of the exercises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Each exercise described in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
4 above shall be performed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least one minute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If at any time during the test, the subject detects the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
banana-like odor of IAA, the test has failed. The subject shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quickly exit from the test chamber and leave the test area to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid olfactory fatigue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
10. If the test is failed, the subject shall return to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection room and remove the respirator, repeat the odor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitivity test, select and put on another respirator, return to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test chamber, and again begin the procedure described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c(4) through c(8) above. The process continues until a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator that fits well has been found. Should the odor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitivity test be failed, the subject shall wait about 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minutes before retesting. Odor sensitivity will usually have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned by this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. If a person cannot pass the fit test described above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wearing a half-mask respirator from the available selection, full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facepiece models must be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. When a respirator is found that passes the test, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject breaks the faceseal and takes a breath before exiting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber. This is to assure that the reason the test subject is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not smelling the IAA is the good fit of the respirator facepiece 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seal and not olfactory fatigue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. When the test subject leaves the chamber, the subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall remove the saturated towel and return it to the person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducting the test. To keep the area from becoming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated, the used towels shall be kept in a self-sealing bag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so there is no significant IAA concentration buildup in the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber during subsequent tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. At least two facepieces shall be selected for the IAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test protocol. The test subject shall be given the opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to wear them for one week to choose the one which is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comfortable to wear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Persons who have successfully passed this fit test with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
half-mask respirator may be assigned the use of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator in atmospheres with up to 10 times the PEL of airborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos. In atmospheres greater than 10 times, and less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 times the PEL (up to 100 ppm), the subject must pass the IAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test using a full face negative pressure respirator. (The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of the 1AA inside the test chamber must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased by ten times for QLFT of the full facepiece.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. The test shall not be conducted if there is any hair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth between the skin the facepiece sealing surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. If hair growth or apparel interfere with a satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fit, then they shall be altered or removed so as to eliminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interference and allow a satisfactory fit. If a satisfactory fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is still not attained, the test subject must use a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive-pressure respirator such as powered air-purifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirators, supplied air respirator, or self-contained breathing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apparatus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. If a test subject exhibits difficulty in breathing during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tests, she or he shall be referred to a physician trained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator diseases or pulmonary medicine to determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test subject can wear a respirator while performing her or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. Qualitative fit testing shall be repeated at least every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. In addition, because the sealing of the respirator may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected, qualitative fit testing shall be repeated immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the test subject has a: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Weight change of 20 pounds or more, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Significant facial scarring in the area of the facepiece seal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Significant dental changes; i.e.; multiple extractions without prothesis, or acquiring dentures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Reconstructive or cosmetic surgery, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 B. Taste Threshold Screening. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. An enclosure about head and shoulders shall be used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold screening (to determine if the individual can taste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saccharin) and for fit testing. The enclosure shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 12 inches in diameter by 14 inches tall with at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least the front clear to allow free movement of the head when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator is worn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The test enclosure shall have a three-quarter inch hole in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
front of the test subject's nose and mouth area to accommodate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nebulizer nozzle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The entire screening and testing procedure shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained to the test subject prior to conducting the screening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. During the threshold screening test, the test subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall don the test enclosure and breathe with open mouth with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tongue extended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Using a DeVilbiss Model 40 Inhalation Medication Nebulizer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or equivalent, the test conductor shall spray the threshold check 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solution into the enclosure. This nebulizer shall be clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marked to distinguish it from the fit test solution nebulizer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The threshold check solution consists of 0.83 grams of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sodium saccharin, USP in water. It can be prepared by putting 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cc of the test solution (see C 7 below) in 100 cc of water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. To produce the aerosol, the nebulizer bulb is firmly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
squeezed so that it collapses completely, then is released and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed to fully expand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Ten squeezes of the nebulizer bulb are repeated rapidly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and then the test subject is asked whether the saccharin can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tasted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If the first response is negative, ten more squeezes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nebulizer bulb are repeated rapidly and the test subject is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
again asked whether the saccharin can be tasted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. If the second response is negative ten more squeezes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeated rapidly and the test subject is again asked whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saccharin can be tasted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The test conductor will take note of the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
squeezes required to elicit a taste response. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. If the saccharin is not tasted after 30 squeezes (Step 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10), the saccharin fit test cannot be performed on the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. If a taste response is elicited, the test subject shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be asked to take note of the taste for reference in the fit test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 14. Correct use of the nebulizer means that approximately 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cc of liquid is used at a time in the nebulizer body. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 15. The nebulizer shall be thoroughly rinsed in water, shaken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry, and refilled at least every four hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. Fit test.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 1. The test subject shall don and adjust the respirator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without the assistance from any person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. The fit test uses the same enclosure described in IIB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 3. Each test subject shall wear the respirator for a least 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minutes before starting the fit test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The test subject shall don the enclosure while wearing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator selected in section IB above. This respirator shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be properly adjusted and equipped with a particulate filter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The test subject may not eat, drink (except plain water), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or chew gum for 15 minutes before the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A second DeVilbiss Model 40 Inhalation Medication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nebulizer is used to spray the fit test solution into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enclosure. This nebulizer shall be clearly marked to distinguish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it from the screening test solution nebulizer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The fit test solution is prepared by adding 83 grams of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sodium saccharin to 100 cc of warm water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. As before, the test subject shall breathe with mouth open 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and tongue extended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The nebulizer is inserted into the hole in the front of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the enclosure and the fit test solution is sprayed into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enclosure using the same technique as for the taste threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screening and the same number of squeezes required to elicit a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taste response in the screening. (See B8 through B10 above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 10. After generation of the aerosol read the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions to the test subject. The test subject shall perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exercises for one minute each. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Breathe normally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Breathe deeply. Be certain breaths are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
deep 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
regular. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. Turn head all the way from one side to the other. Be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 certain movement is complete. Inhale on each side. Do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 not bump the respirator against the shoulders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. Nod head up-and-down. Be certain motions are complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Inhale when head is in the full up position (when looking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 toward the ceiling). Do not to bump the respirator on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the chest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
v. Talking. Talk aloud and slowly for several minutes. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 following paragraph is called the Rainbow Passage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Reading it will result in a wide range of facial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 movements, and thus be useful to satisfy this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 requirement. Alternative passages which serve the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 purpose may also be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vi. Jogging in place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vii. Breathe normally.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
 11. At the beginning of each exercise, the aerosol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration shall be replenished using one-half the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
squeezes as initially described in C9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The test subject shall indicate to the test conductor if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at any time during the fit test the taste of saccharin is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. If the saccharin is detected the fit is deemed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unsatisfactory and a different respirator shall be tried. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. At least two facepieces shall be selected by the IAA test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protocol. The test subject shall be given the opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wear them for one week to choose the one which is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comfortable to wear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Successful completion of the test protocol shall allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of the half mask tested respirator in contaminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmospheres up to 10 times the PEL of asbestos. In other words 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this protocol may be used assign protection factors no higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than ten. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. The test shall not be conducted if there is any hair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth between the skin and the facepiece sealing surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. If hair growth or apparel interfere with a satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fit, then they shall be altered or removed so as to eliminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interference and allow a satisfactory fit. If a satisfactory fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is still not attained, the test subject must use a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive-pressure respirator such as powered air-purifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirators, supplied air respirator, or self-contained breathing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apparatus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. If a test subject exhibits difficulty in breathing during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tests, she or he shall be referred to a physician trained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator diseases or pulmonary medicine to determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test subject can wear a respirator while performing her or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. Qualitative fit testing shall be repeated at least every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 20. In addition, because the sealing of the respirator may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected, qualitative fit testing shall be repeated immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the test subject has a: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Weight change of 20 pounds or more,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Respirator selection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respirators shall be selected as described in section IB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, except that each respirator shall be equipped with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of high-efficiency and acid-gas cartridges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B. Fit test.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The test subject shall be allowed to smell a weak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of the irritant smoke to familiarize the subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the characteristic odor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The test subject shall properly don the respirator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected as above, and wear it for at least 10 minutes before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
starting the fit test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The test conductor shall review this protocol with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test subject before testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The test subject shall perform the conventional positive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure and negative pressure fit checks (see ANSI Z88.2 1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure of either check shall be cause to select an alternate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Break both ends of a ventilation smoke tube containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stannic oxychloride, such as the MSA part 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
5645, or equivalent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attach a short length of tubing to one end of the smoke tube. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attach the other end of the smoke tube to a low pressure air pump 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set to deliver 200 milliliters per minute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Advise the test subject that the smoke can be irritating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the eyes and instruct the subject to keep the eyes closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while the test is performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The test conductor shall direct the stream of irritant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke from the tube towards the faceseal area of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject. The person conducting the test shall begin with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tube at least 12 inches from the facepiece and gradually move to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within one inch, moving around the whole perimeter of the mask. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The test subject shall be instructed to do the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercises while the respirator is being challenged by the smoke. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each exercise shall be performed for one minute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Breathe normally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Breathe deeply. Be certain breaths are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
deep
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
regular
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. Turn head all the way from one side to the other. Be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain movement is complete. Inhale on each side. Do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not bump the respirator against the shoulders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. Nod head up-and-down. Be certain motions are complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and made every second. Inhale when head is in the full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up position (looking toward ceiling). Do not bump the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator against the chest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
v. Talking. Talk aloud and slowly for several minutes. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following paragraph is called the Rainbow Passage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reading it will result in a wide range of facial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
movements, and thus be useful to satisfy this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. Alternative passages which serve the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose may also be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Rainbow Passage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
round arch, with its path high above, and its two end apparently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vi. Jogging in Place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vii. Breathe normally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The test subject shall indicate to the test conductor if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the irritant smoke is detected. If smoke is detected, the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conductor shall stop the test. In this case, the tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator is rejected and another respirator shall be selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Each test subject passing the smoke test (i.e. without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detecting the smoke) shall be given a sensitivity check of smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the same tube to determine if the test subject reacts to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke. Failure to evoke a response shall void the fit test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Steps B4, B9, B10 of this fit test protocol shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed in a location with exhaust ventilation sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent general contamination of the testing area by the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. At least two facepieces shall be selected by the IAA test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protocol. The test subject shall be given the opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wear them for one week to choose the one which is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comfortable to wear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Respirators successfully tested by the protocol may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in contaminated atmospheres up to ten times the PEL of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The test shall not be conducted if there is any hair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth between the skin and the facepiece sealing surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. If hair growth or apparel interfere with a satisfactory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fit, then they shall be altered or removed so as to eliminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interference and allow a satisfactory fit. If a satisfactory fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is still not attained, the test subject must use a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive-pressure respirator such as powered air-purifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirators, supplied air respirator, or self-contained breathing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apparatus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. If a test subject exhibits difficulty in breathing during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tests, she or he shall be referred to a physician trained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator diseases or pulmonary medicine to determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test subject can wear a respirator while performing her or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Qualitative fit testing shall be repeated at least every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. In addition, because the sealing of the respirator may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected, qualitative fit testing shall be repeated immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the test subject has a: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Weight change of 20 pounds or more, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Significant facial scarring in the area of the facepiece 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Significant dental changes; i.e.; multiple extractions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without prothesis, or acquiring dentures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Reconstructive or cosmetic surgery, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Any other condition that may interfere with facepiece 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sealing.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. ``Quantitative Fit Test'' means the measurement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of a respirator seal in excluding the ambient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmosphere. The test is performed by dividing the measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of challenge agent in a test chamber by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured concentration of the challenge agent inside the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator facepiece when the normal air purifying element has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been replaced by an essentially perfect purifying element. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. ``Challenge Agent'' means the air contaminant introduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into a test chamber so that its concentration inside and outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the respirator may be compared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. ``Test Subject'' means the person wearing the respirator for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative fit testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. ``Normal Standing Position'' means standing erect and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
straight with arms down along the sides and looking straight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ahead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. ``Fit Factor'' means the ratio of challenge agent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration outside with respect to the inside of a respirator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inlet covering (facepiece or enclosure). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Apparatus
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Instrumentation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Corn oil, sodium chloride or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate aerosol generation, dilution, and measurement systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be used for quantitative fit test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Test chamber.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The test chamber shall be large enough to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit all test subjects to freely perform all required exercises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without distributing the challenge agent concentration or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement apparatus. The test chamber shall be equipped and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constructed so that the challenge agent is effectively isolated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the ambient air yet uniform in concentration throughout the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. When testing air-purifying respirators, the normal filter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or cartridge element shall be replaced with a high-efficiency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular filter supplied by the same manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The sampling instrument shall be selected so that a strip 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chart record may be made of the test showing the rise and fall of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenge agent concentration with each inspiration and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration at fit factors of at least 2,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The combination of substitute air-purifying elements (if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any), challenge agent, and challenge agent concentration in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test chamber shall be such that the test subject is not exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in excess of PEL to the challenge agent at any time during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. The sampling port on the test specimen respirator shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed and constructed so that there is no detectable leak around 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the port, a free air flow is allowed into the sampling line at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all times and so there is no interference with the fit or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of the respirator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. The test chamber and test set-up shall permit the person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administering the test to observe one test subject inside the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber during the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. The equipment generating the challenge atmosphere shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain the concentration of challenge agent constant within a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 percent variation for the duration of the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The time lag (interval between an event and its being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recorded on the strip chart) of the instrumentation may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed 2 seconds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. The tubing for the test chamber atmosphere and for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator sampling port shall be the same diameter, length and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material. It shall be kept as short as possible. The smallest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diameter tubing recommended by the manufacturer shall be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. The exhaust flow from the test chamber shall pass through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a high-efficiency filter before release to the room. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
l. When sodium chloride aerosol is used, the relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humidity inside the test chamber shall not exceed 50 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Procedural Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. The fitting of half-mask respirators should be started 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with those having multiple sizes and a variety of interchangeable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cartridges and canisters such as the MSA Comfo II-M, Norton M, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Survivair M, A&hyph;O M, or Scott-M. Use either of the tests outlined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below to assure that the facepiece is properly adjusted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Positive pressure test.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 With the exhaust port(s) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blocked, the negative pressure of slight inhalation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should remain constant for several seconds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Negative pressure test.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 With the intake port(s) blocked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the negative pressure slight inhalation should remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constant for several seconds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. After a facepiece is adjusted, the test subject shall wear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facepiece for at least 5 minutes before conducting a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualitative test by using either of the methods described below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and using the exercise regime described in 5.a., b., c., d. and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Isoamyl acetate test.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 When using organic vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cartridges, the test subject who can smell the odor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be unable to detect the odor of isoamyl acetate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
squirted into the air near the most vulnerable portions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the facepiece seal. In a location which is separated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the test area, the test subject shall be instructed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to close her/his eyes during the test period. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination cartridge or canister with organic vapor and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high-efficiency filters shall be used when available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the particular mask being tested. The test subject shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be given an opportunity to smell the odor of isoamyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acetate before the test is conducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Irritant fume test.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 When using high-efficiency filters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test subject should be unable to detect the odor of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
irritant fume (stannic chloride or titanium tetrachloride 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ventilation smoke tubes) squirted into the air near the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most vulnerable portions of the facepiece seal. The test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject shall be instructed to close her/his eyes during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The test subject may enter the quantitative testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber only if she or he has obtained a satisfactory fit as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated in 4.b. of this Appendix.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
d. Before the subject enters the test chamber, a reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stable challenge agent concentration shall be measured in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test chamber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Immediately after the subject enters the test chamber, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenge agent concentration inside the respirator shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured to ensure that the peak penetration does not exceed 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent for a half-mask and 1 percent for a full facepiece. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. A stable challenge agent concentration shall be obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the actual start of testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Respirator restraining straps may not be over-tightened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for testing. The straps shall be adjusted by the wearer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to give a reasonably comfortable fit typical of normal

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Same as exercise a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Rainbow Passage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a man looks for something beyond reach, his friends say he is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The test shall be terminated whenever any single peak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penetration exceeds 5 percent for half-masks and 1 percent for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full facepieces. The test subject may be refitted and retested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If two the three required tests are terminated, the fit shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed inadequate. (See paragraph 4.h.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Calculation of Fit Factors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. The fit factor determined by the quantitative fit test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equals the average concentration inside the respirator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The average test chamber concentration is the arithmetic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average of the test chamber concentration at the beginning and of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the end of the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The average peak concentration of the challenge agent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inside the respirator shall be the arithmetic average peak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations for each of the nine exercises of the test which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are computed as the arithmetic average of the peak concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found for each breath during the exercise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The average peak concentration for an exercise may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined graphically if there is not a great variation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peak concentrations during a single exercise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Interpretation of Test Results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The fit factor measured by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the quantitative fit testing shall be the lowest of the three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection factors resulting from three independent tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Other Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. The test subject shall not be permitted to wear a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
half-mask or full facepiece mask if the minimum fit factor of 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or 1,000, respectively, cannot be obtained. If hair growth or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apparel interfere with a satisfactory fit, then they shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
altered or removed so as to eliminate interference and allow a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory fit. If a satisfactory fit is still not attained, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test subject must use a positive-pressure respirator such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
powered air-purifying respirators, supplied air respirator, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-contained breathing apparatus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The test shall not be conducted if there is any hair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth between the skin and the facepiece sealing surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. If a test subject exhibits difficulty in breathing during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tests, she or he shall be referred to a physician trained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirator diseases or pulmonary medicine to determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the test subject can wear a respirator while performing her or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The test subject shall be given the opportunity to wear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assigned respirator for one week. If the respirator does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a satisfactory fit during actual use, the test subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may request another QNFT which shall be performed immediately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. A respirator fit factor card shall be issued to the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject with the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Name 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Date of fit test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Protection factors obtained through each manufacturer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model and approval number of respirator tested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Name and signature of the person that conducted the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Filters used for qualitative or quantitative fit testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be replaced weekly, whenever increased breathing resistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is encountered, or when the test agent has altered the integrity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the filter media. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic vapor cartridges/canisters shall be replaced daily or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sooner if there is any indication of breakthrough by the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In addition, because the sealing of the respirator may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected, quantitative fit testing shall be repeated immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the test subject has a: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Weight change of 20 pounds or more, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Significant facial scarring in the area of the facepiece 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Significant dental changes; i.e.; multiple extractions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without prothesis, or acquiring dentures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Reconstructive or cosmetic surgery, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Any other condition that may interfere with facepiece 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sealing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Recordkeeping
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A summary of all test results shall be maintained in for 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. The summary shall include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Name of test subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Date of testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Name of the test conductor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Fit factors obtained from every respirator tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(indicate manufacturer, model, size and approval number).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This mandatory appendix contains the medical questionnaires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that must be administered to all employees who are exposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos, tremolite, anthophyllite, actinolite, or a combination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these minerals above the permissible exposure limit (0.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f/cc), and who will therefore be included in their employer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical surveillance program. Part 1 of the appendix contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Initial Medical Questionnaire, which must be obtained for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new hires who will be covered by the medical surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. Part 2 includes the abbreviated Periodical Medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questionnaire, which must be administered to all employees who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are provided periodic medical examinations under the medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance provisions of the standard.

Appendix F to &sect;1915.1001_Work Practices and Engineering Controls for Class I Asbestos Operations Non-Mandatory

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a non-mandatory appendix to the asbestos standards for construction and for shipyards. It describes criteria
and procedures for erecting and using negative pressure enclosures for Class I Asbestos Work, when NPEs are used as
an allowable control method to comply with paragraph (g)(5) (i) of this section. Many small and variable details are
involved in the erection of a negative pressure enclosure. OSHA and most participants in the rulemaking agreed that
only the major, more performance oriented criteria should be made mandatory. These criteria are set out in paragraph
(g) of this section. In addition, this appendix includes these mandatory specifications and procedures in its guidelines
in order to make this appendix coherent and helpful. The mandatory nature of the criteria which appear in the regulatory
text is not changed because they are included in this ``non-mandatory'' appendix. Similarly, the additional criteria
and procedures included as guidelines in the appendix, do not become mandatory because mandatory criteria are also
included in these comprehensive guidelines.

In addition, none of the criteria, both mandatory and recommended, are meant to specify or imply the need for use of
patented or licensed methods or equipment. Recommended specifications included in this attachment should not discourage
the use of creative alternatives which can be shown to reliably achieve the objectives of negative-pressure enclosures.

Planning the Project
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The standard requires that an exposure assessment be conducted before the asbestos job is begun &sect;1915.1001(f)(1).
Information needed for that assessment, includes data relating to prior similar jobs, as applied to the specific
variables of the current job. The information needed to conduct the assessment will be useful in planning the project,
and in complying with any reporting requirements under this standard, when significant changes are being made to
a control system listed in the standard, [see paragraph (k) of this section], as well as those of USEPA (40 CFR Part 61,
subpart M). Thus, although the standard does not explicitly require the preparation of a written asbestos removal
plan, the usual constituents of such a plan, i.e., a description of the enclosure, the equipment, and the procedures
to be used throughout the project, must be determined before the enclosure can be erected. The following information
should be included in the planning of the system:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A physical description of the work area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A description of the approximate amount of material to be removed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A schedule for turning off and sealing existing ventilation systems; Personnel hygiene procedures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A description of personal protective equipment and clothing to worn by employees;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A description of the local exhaust ventilation systems to be used and how they are to be tested;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A description of work practices to be observed by employees;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An air monitoring plan;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A description of the method to be used to transport waste material; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The location of the dump site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Materials and Equipment Necessary for Asbestos Removal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Although individual asbestos removal projects vary in terms of the equipment required to accomplish the removal
of the materials, some equipment and materials are common to most asbestos removal operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plastic sheeting used to protect horizontal surfaces, seal HVAC openings or to seal vertical openings and ceilings
should have a minimum thickness of 6 mils. Tape or other adhesive used to attach plastic sheeting should be of sufficient
adhesive strength to support the weight of the material plus all stresses encountered during the entire duration
of the project without becoming detached from the surface.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other equipment and materials which should be available at the beginning of each project are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_HEPA Filtered Vacuum is essential for cleaning the work area after the asbestos has been removed. It should have a
long hose capable of reaching out-of-the-way places, such as areas above ceiling tiles, behind pipes, etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Portable air ventilation systems installed to provide the negative air pressure and air removal from the enclosure
must be equipped with a HEPA filter. The number and capacity of units required to ventilate an enclosure depend on the
size of the area to be ventilated. The filters for these systems should be designed in such a manner that they can be replaced
when the air flow volume is reduced by the build-up of dust in the filtration material. Pressure monitoring devices
with alarms and strip chart recorders attached to each system to indicate the pressure differential and the loss due
to dust buildup on the filter are recommended.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
_Water sprayers should be used to keep the asbestos material as saturated as possible during removal; the sprayers
will provide a fine mist that minimizes the impact of the spray on the material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Water used to saturate the asbestos containing material can be amended by adding at least 15 milliliters (1/4 ounce)
of wetting agent in 1 liter (1 pint) of water. An example of a wetting agent is a 50/50 mixture of polyoxyethylene ether
and polyoxyethylene polyglycol ester.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Backup power supplies are recommended, especially for ventilation systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Shower and bath water should be with mixed hot and cold water faucets. Water that has been used to clean personnel or
equipment should either be filtered or be collected and discarded as asbestos waste. Soap and shampoo should be provided
to aid in removing dust from the workers' skin and hair.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Preparing the Work Area
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Disabling HVAC Systems: The power to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems that service the restricted
area must be deactivated and locked off. All ducts, grills, access ports, windows and vents must be sealed off with
two layers of plastic to prevent entrainment of contaminated air.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating HVAC Systems in the Restricted Area: If components of a HVAC system located in the restricted area are connected
to a system that will service another zone during the project, the portion of the duct in the restricted area must be
sealed and pressurized. Necessary precautions include caulking the duct joints, covering all cracks and openings
with two layers of sheeting, and pressurizing the duct throughout the duration of the project by restricting the return
air flow. The power to the fan supplying the positive pressure should be locked ``on'' to prevent pressure loss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sealing Elevators: If an elevator shaft is located in the restricted area, it should be either shut down or isolated
by sealing with two layers of plastic sheeting. The sheeting should provide enough slack to accommodate the pressure
changes in the shaft without breaking the air-tight seal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removing Mobile Objects: All movable objects should be cleaned and removed from the work area before an enclosure
is constructed unless moving the objects creates a hazard. Mobile objects will be assumed to be contaminated and should
be either cleaned with amended water and a HEPA vacuum and then removed from the area or wrapped and then disposed of
as hazardous waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cleaning and Sealing Surfaces: After cleaning with water and a HEPA vacuum, surfaces of stationary objects should
be covered with two layers of plastic sheeting. The sheeting should be secured with duct tape or an equivalent method
to provide a tight seal around the object.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bagging Waste: In addition to the requirement for immediate bagging of waste for disposal, it is further recommended
that the waste material be double-bagged and sealed in plastic bags designed for asbestos disposal. The bags should
be stored in a waste storage area that can be controlled by the workers conducting the removal. Filters removed from
air handling units and rubbish removed from the area are to be bagged and handled as hazardous waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Constructing the Enclosure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The enclosure should be constructed to provide an air-tight seal around ducts and openings into existing ventilation
systems and around penetrations for electrical conduits, telephone wires, water lines, drain pipes, etc. Enclosures
should be both airtight and watertight except for those openings designed to provide entry and/or air flow control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Size: An enclosure should be the minimum volume to encompass all of the working surfaces yet allow unencumbered movement
by the worker(s), provide unrestricted air flow past the worker(s), and ensure walking surfaces can be kept free of
tripping hazards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shape: The enclosure may be any shape that optimizes the flow of ventilation air past the worker(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Structural Integrity: The walls, ceilings and floors must be supported in such a manner that portions of the enclosure
will not fall down during normal use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Openings: It is not necessary that the structure be airtight; openings may be designed to direct air flow. Such openings
should be located at a distance from active removal operations. They should be designed to draw air into the enclosure
under all anticipated circumstances. In the event that negative pressure is lost, they should be fitted with either
HEPA filters to trap dust or automatic trap doors that prevent dust from escaping the enclosure. Openings for exits
should be controlled by an airlock or a vestibule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Barrier Supports: Frames should be constructed to support all unsupported spans of sheeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sheeting: Walls, barriers, ceilings, and floors should be lined with two layers of plastic sheeting having a thickness
of at least 6 mil.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seams: Seams in the sheeting material should be minimized to reduce the possibilities of accidental rips and tears
in the adhesive or connections. All seams in the sheeting should overlap, be staggered and not be located at corners
or wall-to- floor joints. Areas Within an Enclosure: Each enclosure consists of a work area, a decontamination area,
and waste storage area. The work area where the asbestos removal operations occur should be separated from both the
waste storage area and the contamination control area by physical curtains, doors, and/or airflow patterns that
force any airborne contamination back into the work area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
See paragraph (j) of &sect;1915.1001 for requirements for hygiene facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During egress from the work area, each worker should step into the equipment room, clean tools and equipment, and remove
gross contamination from clothing by wet cleaning and HEPA vacuuming. Before entering the shower area, foot coverings,
head coverings, hand coverings, and coveralls are removed and placed in impervious bags for disposal or cleaning.
Airline connections from airline respirators with HEPA disconnects and power cables from powered air-purifying
respirators (PAPRs) will be disconnected just prior to entering the shower room.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Establishing Negative Pressure Within the Enclosure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Negative Pressure: Air is to be drawn into the enclosure under all anticipated conditions and exhausted through a
HEPA filter for 24 hours a day during the entire duration of the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Flow Tests: Air flow patterns will be checked before removal operations begin, at least once per operating shift
and any time there is a question regarding the integrity of the enclosure. The primary test for air flow is to trace air
currents with smoke tubes or other visual methods. Flow checks are made at each opening and at each doorway to demonstrate
that air is being drawn into the enclosure and at each worker's position to show that air is being drawn away from the
breathing zone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring Pressure Within the Enclosure: After the initial air flow patterns have been checked, the static pressure
must be monitored within the enclosure. Monitoring may be made using manometers, pressure gauges, or combinations
of these devices. It is recommended that they be attached to alarms and strip chart recorders at points identified
by the design engineer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corrective Actions: If the manometers or pressure gauges demonstrate a reduction in pressure differential below
the required level, work should cease and the reason for the change investigated and appropriate changes made. The
air flow patterns should be retested before work begins again.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pressure Differential: The design parameters for static pressure differentials between the inside and outside
of enclosures typically range from 0.02 to 0.10 inches of water gauge, depending on conditions. All zones inside the
enclosure must have less pressure than the ambient pressure outside of the enclosure (&hyph;0.02 inches water gauge
differential). Design specifications for the differential vary according to the size, configuration, and shape
of the enclosure as well as ambient and mechanical air pressure conditions around the enclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Flow Patterns: The flow of air past each worker shall be enhanced by positioning the intakes and exhaust ports to
remove contaminated air from the worker's breathing zone, by positioning HEPA vacuum cleaners to draw air from the
worker's breathing zone, by forcing relatively uncontaminated air past the worker toward an exhaust port, or by using
a combination of methods to reduce the worker's exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Handling Unit Exhaust: The exhaust plume from air handling units should be located away from adjacent personnel
and intakes for HVAC systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Flow Volume: The air flow volume (cubic meters per minute) exhausted (removed) from the workplace must exceed
the amount of makeup air supplied to the enclosure. The rate of air exhausted from the enclosure should be designed
to maintain a negative pressure in the enclosure and air movement past each worker. The volume of air flow removed from
the enclosure should replace the volume of the container at every 5 to 15 minutes. Air flow volume will need to be relatively
high for large enclosures, enclosures with awkward shapes, enclosures with multiple openings, and operations employing
several workers in the enclosure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Flow Velocity: At each opening, the air flow velocity must visibly ``drag'' air into the enclosure. The velocity
of air flow within the enclosure must be adequate to remove airborne contamination from each worker's breathing zone
without disturbing the asbestos-containing material on surfaces.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airlocks: Airlocks are mechanisms on doors and curtains that control the air flow patterns in the doorways. If air
flow occurs, the patterns through doorways must be such that the air flows toward the inside of the enclosure. Sometimes
vestibules, double doors, or double curtains are used to prevent air movement through the doorways. To use a vestibule,
a worker enters a chamber by opening the door or curtain and then closing the entry before opening the exit door or curtain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airlocks should be located between the equipment room and shower room, between the shower room and the clean room,
and between the waste storage area and the outside of the enclosure. The air flow between adjacent rooms must be checked
using smoke tubes or other visual tests to ensure the flow patterns draw air toward the work area without producing
eddies.

Monitoring for Airborne Concentrations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the breathing zone samples taken as outlined in paragraph (f) of &sect;1915.1001 , samples of air should
be taken to demonstrate the integrity of the enclosure, the cleanliness of the clean room and shower area, and the effectiveness
of the HEPA filter. If the clean room is shown to be contaminated, the room must be relocated to an uncontaminated area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Samples taken near the exhaust of portable ventilation systems must be done with care.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

General Work Practices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Preventing dust dispersion is the primary means of controlling the spread of asbestos within the enclosure. Whenever
practical, the point of removal should be isolated, enclosed, covered, or shielded from the workers in the area. Waste
asbestos containing materials must be bagged during or immediately after removal; the material must remain saturated
until the waste container is sealed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste material with sharp points or corners must be placed in hard air-tight containers rather than bags.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whenever possible, large components should be sealed in plastic sheeting and removed intact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bags or containers of waste will be moved to the waste holding area, washed, and wrapped in a bag with the appropriate
labels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Cleaning the Work Area
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Surfaces within the work area should be kept free of visible dust and debris to the extent feasible. Whenever visible
dust appears on surfaces, the surfaces within the enclosure must be cleaned by wiping with a wet sponge, brush, or cloth
and then vacuumed with a HEPA vacuum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All surfaces within the enclosure should be cleaned before the exhaust ventilation system is deactivated and the
enclosure is disassembled. An approved encapsulate may be sprayed onto areas after the visible dust has been removed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Substance: ``Asbestos'' is the name of a class of magnesium-silicate minerals that occur in fibrous form. Minerals
that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in this group are chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anthophyllite asbestos, tremolite asbestos, and actinolite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Asbestos is and was used in the manufacture of heat-resistant clothing, automotive brake and clutch linings, and
a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variety of building materials including floor tiles, roofing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
felts, ceiling tiles, asbestos-cement pipe and sheet, and fire-resistant drywall. Asbestos is also present in pipe
and boiler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insulation materials and in sprayed-on materials located on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beams, in crawlspaces, and between walls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The potential for an asbestos-containing product to release 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breathable fibers depends largely on its degree of friability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Friable means that the material can be crumbled with hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure and is therefore likely to emit fibers. The fibrous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluffy sprayed-on materials used for fireproofing, insulation, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sound proofing are considered to be friable, and they readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
release airborne fibers if disturbed. Materials such as vinyl-asbestos floor tile or roofing felt are considered
non-friable if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intact and generally do not emit airborne fibers unless subjected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to sanding, sawing and other aggressive operations. Asbestos_cement pipe or sheet can emit airborne fibers if the
materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are cut or sawed, or if they are broken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Permissible exposure: Exposure to airborne asbestos fibers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not exceed 0.1 fibers per cubic centimeter of air (0.1 f/cc) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
averaged over the 8-hour workday, and 1 fiber per cubic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
centimeter of air (1.0 f/cc) averaged over a 30 minute work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Health Hazard Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Asbestos can cause disabling respiratory disease and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various types of cancers if the fibers are inhaled. Inhaling or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingesting fibers from contaminated clothing or skin can also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in these diseases. The symptoms of these diseases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally do not appear for 20 or more years after initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Exposure to asbestos has been shown to cause lung cancer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mesothelioma, and cancer of the stomach and colon. Mesothelioma 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a rare cancer of the thin membrane lining of the chest and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abdomen. Symptoms of mesothelioma include shortness of breath, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pain in the walls of the chest, and/or abdominal pain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Respirators and Protective Clothing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Respirators: You are required to wear a respirator when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing tasks that result in asbestos exposure that exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 f/cc and when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing certain designated operations. Air-purifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirators equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HEPA) filter can be used where airborne asbestos fiber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations do not exceed 1.0 f/cc; otherwise, more protective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirators such as air-supplied, positive-pressure, full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facepiece respirators must be used. Disposable respirators or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dust masks are not permitted to be used for asbestos work. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective protection, respirators must fit your face and head 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
snugly. Your employer is required to conduct fit test when you 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are first assigned a respirator and every 6 months thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respirators should not be loosened or removed in work situations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where their use is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Protective Clothing: You are required to wear protective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clothing in work areas where asbestos fiber concentrations exceed

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Wastes that are generated by processes where asbestos is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Empty asbestos shipping containers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Process wastes such as cuttings, trimmings, or reject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Housekeeping waste from wet-sweeping or HEPA-vacuuming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Asbestos fireproofing or insulating material that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed from buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Asbestos-containing building products removed during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building renovation or demolition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Contaminated disposable protective clothing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Empty shipping bags can be flattened under exhaust hoods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and packed into airtight containers for disposal. Empty shipping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drums are difficult to clean and should be sealed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Vacuum bags or disposable paper filters should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaned, but should be sprayed with a fine water mist and placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into a labeled waste container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Process waste and housekeeping waste should be wetted with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water or a mixture of water and surfactant prior to packaging in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposable containers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Asbestos-containing material that if removed from buildings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be disposed of in leak-tight 6-mil plastic bags, plastic-lined cardboard containers, or plastic-lined metal
containers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These wastes, which are removed while wet, should be sealed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers before they dry out to minimize the release of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos fibers during handling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Access to Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Each year, your employer is required to inform you of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information contained in this standard and appendices for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos. In addition, your employer must instruct you in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper work practices for handling asbestos-containing materials, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the correct use of protective equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Your employer is required to determine whether you are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being exposed to asbestos. Your employer must treat exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal system insulation and sprayed-on and trowled-on surfacing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material as asbestos exposure, unless results of laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis show that the material does not contain asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You or your representative has the right to observe employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements and to record the results obtained. Your employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required to inform you of your exposure, and, if you are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed above the permissible exposure limit, he or she is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to inform you of the actions that are being taken to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce your exposure to within the permissible limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Your employer is required to keep records of your exposures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and medical examinations. These exposure records must be kept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for at least thirty (30) years. Medical records must be kept for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of your employment plus thirty (30) years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Your employer is required to release your exposure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical records to your physician or designated representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon your written request.

II. Toxicology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Clinical evidence of the adverse effects associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to asbestos is present in the form of several well- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers, family contacts of workers, and persons living near 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos mines. These studies have shown a definite association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between exposure to asbestos and an increased incidence of lung 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancer, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, gastrointestinal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancer, and asbestosis. The latter is a disabling fibrotic lung 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease that is caused only by exposure to asbestos. Exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos has also been associated with an increased incidence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
esophageal, kidney, laryngeal, pharyngeal, and buccal cavity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancers. As with other known chronic occupational diseases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease associated with asbestos generally appears about 20 years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following the first occurrence of exposure: There are no known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acute effects associated with exposure to asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Epidemiological studies indicate that the risk of lung cancer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among exposed workers who smoke cigarettes is greatly increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the risk of lung cancer among non-exposed smokers or exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonsmokers. These studies suggest that cessation of smoking will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the risk of lung cancer for a person exposed to asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but will not reduce it to the same level of risk as that existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an exposed worker who has never smoked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Signs and Symptoms of Exposure Related Disease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The signs and symptoms of lung cancer or gastrointestinal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancer induced by exposure to asbestos are not unique, except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a chest X-ray of an exposed patient with lung cancer may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
show pleural plaques, pleural calcification, or pleural fibrosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Symptoms characteristic of mesothelioma include shortness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breath, pain in the walls of the chest, or abdominal pain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mesothelioma has a much longer latency period compared with lung 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancer (40 years versus 15&hyph;20 years), and mesothelioma is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore more likely to be found among workers who were first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to asbestos at an early age. Mesothelioma is always 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fatal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestosis is pulmonary fibrosis caused by the accumulation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos fibers in the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breath, coughing, fatigue, and vague feelings of sickness. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fibrosis worsens, shortness of breath occurs even at rest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diagnosis of asbestosis is based on a history of exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos, the presence of characteristics radiologic changes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end-inspiratory crackles (rales), and other clinical features of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibrosing lung disease. Pleural plaques and thickening are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observed on X-rays taken during the early sates of the disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestosis is often a progressive disease even in the absence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued exposure, although this appears to be a highly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individualized characteristic. In severe cases, death may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by respiratory or cardiac failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Surveillance and Preventive Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, exposure to asbestos have been linked to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased risk of lung cancer, mesothelioma, gastrointestinal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancer, and asbestosis among occupationally exposed workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adequate screening tests to determine an employee's potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing serious chronic diseases, such as a cancer, from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to asbestos do not presently exist. However, some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests, particularly chest X-rays and pulmonary function tests, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may indicate that an employee has been overexposed to asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing his or her risk of developing exposure related chronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diseases. It is important for the physician to become familiar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the operating conditions in which occupational exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos is likely to occur. This is particularly important in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating medical and work histories and in conducting physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations. When an active employee has been identified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having been overexposed to asbestos measures taken by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer to eliminate or mitigate further exposure should also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower the risk of serious long-term consequences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The employer is required to institute a medical surveillance program for all employees who are or will be exposed to
asbestos at or above the permissible exposure limits (0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air) for 30 or more days per
year and for all employees who are assigned to wear a negative-pressure respirator. All examinations and procedures
must be performed by or under the supervision of licensed physician at a reasonable time and place, and at no cost to
the employee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although broad latitude is given to the physician in prescribing specific tests to be included in the medical surveillance
program, OSHA requires inclusion of the following elements in the routine examination,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Medical and work histories with special emphasis directed to symptoms of the respiratory system, cardiovascular
system, and digestive tract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Completion of the respiratory disease questionnaire contained in Appendix D to this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A physical examination including a chest roentgenogram and pulmonary function test that include measurement
of the employee's forced vital capacity (FYC) and forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Any laboratory or other test that the examining physician deems by sound medical practice to be necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The employer is required to make the prescribed tests available at least annually to those employees covered; more
often than specified if recommended by the examining physician; and upon termination of employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The employer is required to provide the physician with the following information: A copy of this standard and appendices;
a description of the employee's duties as they relate to asbestos exposure; the employee's representative level
of exposure to asbestos; a description of any personal protective and respiratory equipment used; and information
from previous medical examinations of the affected employee that is not otherwise available to the physician. Making
this information available to the physician will aid in the evaluation of the employee's health in relation to assigned
duties and fitness to wear personal protective equipment, if required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The employer is required to obtain a written opinion from the examining physician containing the results of the medical
examination; the physician's opinion as to whether the employee has any detected medical conditions that would place
the employee at an increased risk of exposure-related disease; any recommended limitations on the employee or on
the use of personal protective equipment; and a statement that the employee has been informed by the physician of the
results of the medical examination and of any medical conditions related to asbestos exposure that require further
explanation or treatment. This written opinion must not reveal specific findings or diagnoses unrelated to exposure
to asbestos, and a copy of the opinion must be provided to the affected employee.

1.1. History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Light microscopy has been used for well over 100 years for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of mineral species. This analysis is carried out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using specialized polarizing microscopes as well as bright field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopes. The identification of minerals is an on-going 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process with many new minerals described each year. The first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recorded use of asbestos was in Finland about 2500 B.C. where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material was used in the mud wattle for the wooden huts the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people lived in as well as strengthening for pottery. Adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health aspects of the mineral were noted nearly 2000 years ago 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when Pliny the Younger wrote about the poor health of slaves in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the asbestos mines. Although known to be injurious for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
centuries, the first modern references to its toxicity were by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the British Labor Inspectorate when it banned asbestos dust from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the workplace in 1898. Asbestosis cases were described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
literature after the turn of the century. Cancer was first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspected in the mid 1930's and a causal link to mesothelioma was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made in 1965. Because of the public concern for worker and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public safety with the use of this material, several different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of analysis were applied to the determination of asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content. Light microscopy requires a great deal of experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and craft. Attempts were made to apply less subjective methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the analysis. X-ray diffraction was partially successful in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the mineral types but was unable to separate out the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibrous portions from the non-fibrous portions. Also, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum detection limit for asbestos analysis by X-ray 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diffraction (XRD) is about 1%. Differential Thermal Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(DTA) was no more successful. These provide useful corroborating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information when the presence of asbestos has been shown by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopy; however, neither can determine the difference between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibrous and non-fibrous minerals when both habits are present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same is true of Infrared Absorption (IR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When electron microscopy was applied to asbestos analysis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundreds of fibers were discovered present too small to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visible in any light microscope. There are two different types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of electron microscope used for asbestos analysis: Scanning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electron Microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(TEM). Scanning Electron Microscopy is useful in identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minerals. The SEM can provide two of the three pieces of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information required to identify fibers by electron microscopy: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
morphology and chemistry. The third is structure as determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by Selected Area Electron Diffraction_SAED which is performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the TEM. Although the resolution of the SEM is sufficient for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very fine fibers to be seen, accuracy of chemical analysis that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be performed on the fibers varies with fiber diameter in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers of less than 0.2 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m diameter. The TEM is a powerful tool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to identify fibers too small to be resolved by light microscopy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and should be used in conjunction with this method when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. The TEM can provide all three pieces of information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for fiber identification. Most fibers thicker than 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can adequately be defined in the light microscope. The light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscope remains as the best instrument for the determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of mineral type. This is because the minerals under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation were first described analytically with the light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscope. It is inexpensive and gives positive identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for most samples analyzed. Further, when optical techniques are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadequate, there is ample indication that alternative techniques 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be used for complete identification of the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.2. Principle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Minerals consist of atoms that may be arranged in random order or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a regular arrangement. Amorphous materials have atoms in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
random order while crystalline materials have long range order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many materials are transparent to light, at least for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particles or for thin sections. The properties of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials can be investigated by the effect that the material has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on light passing through it. The six asbestos minerals are all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crystalline with particular properties that have been identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and cataloged. These six minerals are anisotropic. They have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular array of atoms, but the arrangement is not the same in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all directions. Each major direction of the crystal presents a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different regularity. Light photons travelling in each of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
main directions will encounter different electrical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neighborhoods, affecting the path and time of travel. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques outlined in this method use the fact that light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traveling through fibers or crystals in different directions will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behave differently, but predictably. The behavior of the light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as it travels through a crystal can be measured and compared with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known or determined values to identify the mineral species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Usually, Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM) is performed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strain-free objectives on a bright-field microscope platform. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This would limit the resolution of the microscope to about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.4 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m. Because OSHA requires the counting and identification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers visible in phase contrast, the phase contrast platform is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to visualize the fibers with the polarizing elements added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the light path. Polarized light methods cannot identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers finer than about 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m in diameter even though they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visible. The finest fibers are usually identified by inference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the presence of larger, identifiable fiber bundles. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers are present, but not identifiable by light microscopy, use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either SEM or TEM to determine the fiber identity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The advantages of light microcopy are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Basic identification of the materials was first performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by light microscopy and gross analysis. This provides a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large base of published information against which to check 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis and analytical technique. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The analysis is specific to fibers. The minerals present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can exist in asbestiform, fibrous, prismatic, or massive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varieties all at the same time. Therefore, bulk methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of analysis such as X-ray diffraction, IR analysis, DTA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
etc. are inappropriate where the material is not known to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be fibrous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The analysis is quick, requires little preparation time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and can be performed on-site if a suitably equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscope is available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disadvantages are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Even using phase-polar illumination, not all the fibers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present may be seen. This is a problem for very low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos concentrations where agglomerations or large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bundles of fibers may not be present to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification by inference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The method requires a great degree of sophistication on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the part of the microscopist. An analyst is only as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful as his mental catalog of images. Therefore, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopist's accuracy is enhanced by experience. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineralogical training of the analyst is very important. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the basis on which subjective decisions are made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The method uses only a tiny amount of material for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. This may lead to sampling bias and false 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results (high or low). This is especially true if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample is severely inhomogeneous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Fibers may be bound in a matrix and not distinguishable as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers so identification cannot be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
1.4.1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This method can be used for determination of asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content from 0 to 100% asbestos. The detection limit has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been adequately determined, although for selected samples, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit is very low, depending on the number of particles examined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For mostly homogeneous, finely divided samples, with no difficult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibrous interferences, the detection limit is below 1%. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhomogeneous samples (most samples), the detection limit remains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undefined. NIST has conducted proficiency testing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratories on a national scale. Although each round is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported statistically with an average, control limits, etc., the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results indicate a difficulty in establishing precision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially in the low concentration range. It is suspected that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is significant bias in the low range especially near 1%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA tried to remedy this by requiring a mandatory point counting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheme for samples less than 10%. The point counting procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is tedious, and may introduce significant biases of its own. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has not been incorporated into this method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
1.4.2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The precision and accuracy of the quantitation tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed in this method are unknown. Concentrations are easier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine in commercial products where asbestos was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deliberately added because the amount is usually more than a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent. An analyst's results can be ``calibrated'' against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known amounts added by the manufacturer. For geological samples, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the degree of homogeneity affects the precision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
1.4.3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The performance of the method is analyst dependent. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyst must choose carefully and not necessarily randomly the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions for analysis to assure that detection of asbestos occurs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when it is present. For this reason, the analyst must have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate training in sample preparation, and experience in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location and identification of asbestos in samples. This is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually accomplished through substantial on-the-job training as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as formal education in mineralogy and microscopy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.5. Interferences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any material which is long, thin, and small enough to be viewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the microscope can be considered an interference for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos. There are literally hundreds of interferences in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workplaces. The techniques described in this method are normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to eliminate the interferences. An analyst's success 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in eliminating the interferences depends on proper training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos minerals belong to two mineral families: the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serpentines and the amphiboles. In the serpentine family, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only common fibrous mineral is chrysotile. Occasionally, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineral antigorite occurs in a fibril habit with morphology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to the amphiboles. The amphibole minerals consist of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
score of different minerals of which only five are regulated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federal standard: amosite, crocidolite, anthophyllite asbestos, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tremolite asbestos and actinolite asbestos. These are the only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amphibole minerals that have been commercially exploited for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their fibrous properties; however, the rest can and do occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occasionally in asbestiform habit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the related mineral interferences, other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minerals common in building material may present a problem for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some microscopists: gypsum, anhydrite, brucite, quartz fibers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
talc fibers or ribbons, wollastonite, perlite, attapulgite, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other fibrous materials commonly present in workplaces are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiberglass, mineral wool, ceramic wool, refractory ceramic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers, kevlar, nomex, synthetic fibers, graphite or carbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers, cellulose (paper or wood) fibers, metal fibers, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Matrix embedding material can sometimes be a negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interference. The analyst may not be able to easily extract the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers from the matrix in order to use the method. Where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible, remove the matrix before the analysis, taking careful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
note of the loss of weight. Some common matrix materials are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vinyl, rubber, tar, paint, plant fiber, cement, and epoxy. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further negative interference is that the asbestos fibers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
themselves may be either too small to be seen in Phase contrast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Microscopy (PCM) or of a very low fibrous quality, having the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appearance of plant fibers. The analyst's ability to deal with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these materials increases with experience.

1.6. Uses and Occupational Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos is ubiquitous in the environment. More than 40% of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
land area of the United States is composed of minerals which may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain asbestos. Fortunately, the actual formation of great 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts of asbestos is relatively rare. Nonetheless, there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations in which environmental exposure can be severe such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Serpentine Hills of California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are thousands of uses for asbestos in industry and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the home. Asbestos abatement workers are the most current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
segment of the population to have occupational exposure to great 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts of asbestos. If the material is undisturbed, there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. Exposure occurs when the asbestos-containing material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is abraded or otherwise disturbed during maintenance operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or some other activity. Approximately 95% of the asbestos in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place in the United States is chrysotile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amosite and crocidolite make up nearly all the difference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tremolite and anthophyllite make up a very small percentage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tremolite is found in extremely small amounts in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chrysotile deposits. Actinolite exposure is probably greatest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from environmental sources, but has been identified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vermiculite containing, sprayed-on insulating materials which may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been certified as asbestos-free.

1.7. Physical and Chemical Properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The nominal chemical compositions for the asbestos minerals were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given in Section 1. Compared to cleavage fragments of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minerals, asbestiform fibers possess a high tensile strength 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
along the fiber axis. They are chemically inert, non-combustible, and heat resistant. Except for chrysotile, they
are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insoluble in Hydrochloric acid (HCl). Chrysotile is slightly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soluble in HCl. Asbestos has high electrical resistance and good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sound absorbing characteristics. It can be woven into cables, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabrics or other textiles, or matted into papers, felts, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.8. Toxicology (This Section is for Information Only and Should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not Be Taken as OSHA Policy) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Possible physiologic results of respiratory exposure to asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are mesothelioma of the pleura or peritoneum, interstitial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibrosis, asbestosis, pneumoconiosis, or respiratory cancer. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible consequences of asbestos exposure are detailed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIOSH Criteria Document or in the OSHA Asbestos Standards 29 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1910.1001 and 29 CFR 1926.1101. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Sampling Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2.1. Equipment for Sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Tube or cork borer sampling device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Knife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 20 mL scintillation vial or similar vial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Sealing encapsulant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2.2. Safety Precautions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos is a known carcinogen. Take care when sampling. While 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an asbestos-containing atmosphere, a properly selected and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fit-tested respirator should be worn. Take samples in a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to cause the least amount of dust. Follow these general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Do not make unnecessary dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Take only a small amount (1 to 2 g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Tightly close the sample container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Use encapsulant to seal the spot where the sample was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2.3. Sampling procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Samples of any suspect material should be taken from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconspicuous place. Where the material is to remain, seal the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling wound with an encapsulant to eliminate the potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure from the sample site. Microscopy requires only a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milligrams of material. The amount that will fill a 20 mL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scintillation vial is more than adequate. Be sure to collect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples from all layers and phases of material. If possible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make separate samples of each different phase of the material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This will aid in determining the actual hazard. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
DO NOT USE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ENVELOPES, PLASTIC OR PAPER BAGS OF ANY KIND TO COLLECT SAMPLES. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of plastic bags presents a contamination hazard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory personnel and to other samples. When these containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are opened, a bellows effect blows fibers out of the container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
onto everything, including the person opening the container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a cork-borer type sampler is available, push the tube 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the material all the way, so that all layers of material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are sampled. Some samplers are intended to be disposable. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be capped and sent to the laboratory. If a non-disposable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cork borer is used, empty the contents into a scintillation vial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and send to the laboratory. Vigorously and completely clean the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cork borer between samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2.4 Shipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Samples packed in glass vials must not touch or they might break 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in shipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Seal the samples with a sample seal (such as the OSHA 21) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the end to guard against tampering and to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Package the bulk samples in separate packages from the air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples. They may cross-contaminate each other and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invalidate the results of the air samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Include identifying paperwork with the samples, but not in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contact with the suspected asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) To maintain sample accountability, ship the samples by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified mail, overnight express, or hand carry them to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the laboratory.

3. Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis of asbestos samples can be divided into two major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts: sample preparation and microscopy. Because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different asbestos uses that may be encountered by the analyst, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each sample may need different preparation steps. The choices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are outlined below. There are several different tests that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed to identify the asbestos species and determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage. They will be explained below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
3.1. Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Do not create unnecessary dust. Handle the samples in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEPA-filter equipped hoods. If samples are received in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bags, envelopes or other inappropriate container, open 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them only in a hood having a face velocity at or greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 100 fpm. Transfer a small amount to a scintillation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vial and only handle the smaller amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Open samples in a hood, never in the open lab area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Index of refraction oils can be toxic. Take care not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
get this material on the skin. Wash immediately with soap 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and water if this happens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Samples that have been heated in the muffle furnace or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drying oven may be hot. Handle them with tongs until they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are cool enough to handle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Some of the solvents used, such as THF (tetrahydrofuran), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are toxic and should only be handled in an appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fume hood and according to instructions given in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->

3.3. Sample Pre-Preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Sample preparation begins with pre-preparation which may include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical reduction of the matrix, heating the sample to dryness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or heating in the muffle furnace. The end result is a sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which has been reduced to a powder that is sufficiently fine to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fit under the cover slip. Analyze different phases of samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately, e.g., tile and the tile mastic should be analyzed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately as the mastic may contain asbestos while the tile may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=3 -->
Wet Samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Samples with a high water content will not give the proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispersion colors and must be dried prior to sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mounting. Remove the lid of the scintillation vial, place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bottle in the drying oven and heat at 100 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C to dryness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(usually about 2 h). Samples which are not submitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lab in glass must be removed and placed in glass vials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or aluminum weighing pans before placing them in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drying oven. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=3 -->
(b) Samples With Organic Interference_Muffle Furnace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
These may include samples with tar as a matrix, vinyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos tile, or any other organic that can be reduced by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating. Remove the sample from the vial and weigh in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance to determine the weight of the submitted portion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Place the sample in a muffle furnace at 500 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C for 1 to 2 h 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or until all obvious organic material has been removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Retrieve, cool and weigh again to determine the weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss on ignition. This is necessary to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos content of the submitted sample, because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyst will be looking at a reduced sample.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Notes: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Heating above 600 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C will cause the sample to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undergo a structural change which, given sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, will convert the chrysotile to forsterite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heating even at lower temperatures for 1 to 2 h may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a measurable effect on the optical properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the minerals. If the analyst is unsure of what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to expect, a sample of standard asbestos should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heated to the same temperature for the same length 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time so that it can be examined for the proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation.

Samples With Organic Interference_THF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Vinyl asbestos tile is the most common material treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this solvent, although, substances containing tar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will sometimes yield to this treatment. Select a portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the material and then grind it up if possible. Weigh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sample and place it in a test tube. Add sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
THF to dissolve the organic matrix. This is usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 4 to 5 mL. Remember, THF is highly flammable. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Filter the remaining material through a tared silver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
membrane, dry and weigh to determine how much is left 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the solvent extraction. Further process the sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to remove carbonate or mount directly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be removed in order to perform dispersion microscopy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Weigh out a portion of the material and place it in a test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tube. Add a sufficient amount of 0.1 M HCl or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decalcifying solution in the tube to react all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbonate as evidenced by gas formation; i.e., when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas bubbles stop, add a little more solution. If no more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas forms, the reaction is complete. Filter the material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out through a tared silver membrane, dry and weigh to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the weight lost.

3.4. Sample Preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Samples must be prepared so that accurate determination can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made of the asbestos type and amount present. The following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps are carried out in the low-flow hood (a low-flow hood has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than 50 fpm flow): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the sample has large lumps, is hard, or cannot be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to lie under a cover slip, the grain size must be reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Place a small amount between two slides and grind the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material between them or grind a small amount in a clean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mortar and pestle. The choice of whether to use an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alumina, ruby, or diamond mortar depends on the hardness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the material. Impact damage can alter the asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineral if too much mechanical shock occurs. (Freezer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mills can completely destroy the observable crystallinity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of asbestos and should not be used). For some samples, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of material can be shaved off with a scalpel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground off with a hand grinder or hack saw blade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preparation tools should either be disposable or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaned thoroughly. Use vigorous scrubbing to loosen the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers during the washing. Rinse the implements with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copious amounts of water and air-dry in a dust-free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the sample is powder or has been reduced as in 1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, it is ready to mount. Place a glass slide on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
piece of optical tissue and write the identification on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the painted or frosted end. Place two drops of index of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refraction medium n=1.550 on the slide. (The medium n=1.550 is chosen because it is the matching index for chrysotile.
Dip the end of a clean paper-clip or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dissecting needle into the droplet of refraction medium on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the slide 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
to moisten it. Then dip the probe into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
powder sample. Transfer what sticks on the probe to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slide. The material on the end of the probe should have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diameter of about 3 mm for a good mount. If the material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is very fine, less sample may be appropriate. For non-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
powder samples such as fiber mats, forceps should be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to transfer a small amount of material to the slide. Stir 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the material in the medium on the slide, spreading it out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and making the preparation as uniform as possible. Place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a cover-slip on the preparation by gently lowering onto 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the slide and allowing it to fall ``trapdoor'' fashion on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preparation to push out any bubbles. Press gently on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cover slip to even out the distribution of particulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the slide. If there is insufficient mounting oil on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the slide, one or two drops may be placed near the edge of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the coverslip on the slide. Capillary action will draw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the necessary amount of liquid into the preparation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Remove excess oil with the point of a laboratory wiper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treat at least two different areas of each phase in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fashion. Choose representative areas of the sample. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be useful to select particular areas or fibers for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. This is useful to identify asbestos in severely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhomogeneous samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When it is determined that amphiboles may be present, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeat the above process using the appropriate high- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispersion oils until an identification is made or all six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos minerals have been ruled out. Note that percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination must be done in the index medium 1.550 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because amphiboles tend to disappear in their matching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mediums. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
3.5. Analytical procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This method presumes some knowledge of mineralogy and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
optical petrography. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis consists of three parts: The determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether there is asbestos present, what type is present and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of how much is present. The general flow of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Gross examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Examination under polarized light on the stereo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Examination by phase-polar illumination on the compound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase microscope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Determination of species by dispersion stain. Examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by Becke line analysis may also be used; however, this is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually more cumbersome for asbestos determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Difficult samples may need to be analyzed by SEM or TEM, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the results from those techniques combined with light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopy for a definitive identification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Identification of a particle as asbestos requires that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be asbestiform. Description of particles should follow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the suggestion of Campbell. (Figure 1)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purpose of regulation, the mineral must be one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six minerals covered and must be in the asbestos growth habit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large specimen samples of asbestos generally have the gross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appearance of wood. Fibers are easily parted from it. Asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers are very long compared with their widths. The fibers have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a very high tensile strength as demonstrated by bending without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breaking. Asbestos fibers exist in bundles that are easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parted, show longitudinal fine structure and may be tufted at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ends showing ``bundle of sticks'' morphology. In the microscope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some of these properties may not be observable. Amphiboles do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not always show striations along their length even when they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos. Neither will they always show tufting. They generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not show a curved nature except for very long fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos and asbestiform minerals are usually characterized in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups by extremely high aspect ratios (greater than 100:1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While aspect ratio analysis is useful for characterizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations of fibers, it cannot be used to identify individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers of intermediate to short aspect ratio. Observation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many fibers is often necessary to determine whether a sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consists of ``cleavage fragments'' or of asbestos fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most cleavage fragments of the asbestos minerals are easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguishable from true asbestos fibers. This is because true 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleavage fragments usually have larger diameters than 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal structure of particles larger than this usually shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them to have no internal fibrillar structure. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleavage fragments of the monoclinic amphiboles show inclined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extinction under crossed polars with no compensator. Asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers usually show extinction at zero degrees or ambiguous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extinction if any at all. Morphologically, the larger cleavage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fragments are obvious by their blunt or stepped ends showing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prismatic habit. Also, they tend to be acicular rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filiform. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the particles are less than 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m in diameter and have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspect ratio greater than or equal to 3:1, it is recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sample be analyzed by SEM or TEM if there is any question 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the fibers are cleavage fragments or asbestiform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Care must be taken when analyzing by electron microscopy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the interferences are different from those in light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopy and may structurally be very similar to asbestos. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classic interference is between anthophyllite and biopyribole or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediate fiber. Use the same morphological clues for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electron microscopy as are used for light microscopy, e.g. fibril 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splitting, internal longitudinal striation, fraying, curvature, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Gross examination: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examine the sample, preferably in the glass vial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determine the presence of any obvious fibrous component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimate a percentage based on previous experience and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current observation. Determine whether any pre-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation is necessary. Determine the number of phases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present. This step may be carried out or augmented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observation at 6 to 40&times; under a stereo microscope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) After performing any necessary pre-preparation, prepare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slides of each phase as described above. Two preparations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the same phase in the same index medium can be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
side-by-side on the same glass for convenience. Examine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the polarizing stereo microscope. Estimate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of asbestos based on the amount of birefringent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Examine the slides on the phase-polar microscopes at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnifications of 160 and 400&times;. Note the morphology of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fibers. Long, thin, very straight fibers with little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
curvature are indicative of fibers from the amphibole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family. Curved, wavy fibers are usually indicative of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chrysotile. Estimate the percentage of asbestos on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase-polar microscope under conditions of crossed polars 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a gypsum plate. Fibers smaller than 1.0 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thickness must be identified by inference to the presence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of larger, identifiable fibers and morphology. If no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larger fibers are visible, electron microscopy should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed. At this point, only a tentative identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be made. Full identification must be made with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispersion microscopy. Details of the tests are included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the appendices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Once fibers have been determined to be present, they must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be identified. Adjust the microscope for dispersion mode 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and observe the fibers. The microscope has a rotating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stage, one polarizing element, and a system for generating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dark-field dispersion microscopy (see Section 4.6. of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix). Align a fiber with its length parallel to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polarizer and note the color of the Becke lines. Rotate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stage to bring the fiber length perpendicular to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polarizer and note the color. Repeat this process for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every fiber or fiber bundle examined. The colors must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the colors generated by standard asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference materials for a positive identification. In n=1.550, amphiboles will generally show a yellow to straw-yellow
color indicating that the fiber indices of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refraction are higher than the liquid. If long, thin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers are noted and the colors are yellow, prepare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further slides as above in the suggested matching liquids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed below:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Where more than one liquid is suggested, the first is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred; however, in some cases this liquid will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give good dispersion color. Take care to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interferences in the other liquid; e.g., wollastonite in n=1.620 will give the same colors as tremolite. In n=1.605
wollastonite will appear yellow in all directions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wollastonite may be determined under crossed polars as it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will change from blue to yellow as it is rotated along its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber axis by tapping on the cover slip. Asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minerals will not change in this way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determination of the angle of extinction may, when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present, aid in the determination of anthophyllite from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tremolite. True asbestos fibers usually have 0
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extinction or ambiguous extinction, while cleavage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fragments have more definite extinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continue analysis until both preparations have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined and all present species of asbestos are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified. If there are no fibers present, or there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than 0.1% present, end the analysis with the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of slides (2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Some fibers have a coating on them which makes dispersion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopy very difficult or impossible. Becke line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis or electron microscopy may be performed in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases. Determine the percentage by light microscopy. TEM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis tends to overestimate the actual percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Percentage determination is an estimate of occluded area, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tempered by gross observation. Gross observation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is used to make sure that the high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnification microscopy does not greatly over- or under-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate the amount of fiber present. This part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis requires a great deal of experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Satisfactory models for asbestos content analysis have not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yet been developed, although some models based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metallurgical grain-size determination have found some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility. Estimation is more easily handled in situations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the grain sizes visible at about 160&times; are about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same and the sample is relatively homogeneous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
View all of the area under the cover slip to make the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage determination. View the fields while moving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stage, paying attention to the clumps of material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These are not usually the best areas to perform dispersion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopy because of the interference from other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials. But, they are the areas most likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent the accurate percentage in the sample. Small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts of asbestos require slower scanning and more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequent analysis of individual fields. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report the area occluded by asbestos as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration. This estimate does not generally take into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration the difference in density of the different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species present in the sample. For most samples this is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate. Simulation studies with similar materials must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be carried out to apply microvisual estimation for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose and is beyond the scope of this procedure.

(7) Where successive concentrations have been made by chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or physical means, the amount reported is the percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the material in the ``as submitted'' or original state. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The percentage determined by microscopy is multiplied by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fractions remaining after pre-preparation steps to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give the percentage in the original sample. For example:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 1. 60% remains after heating at 550 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C for 1 h. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 2. 30% of the residue of step 1 remains after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dissolution of carbonate in 0.1 m HCl. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Auxiliary Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the subjective nature of asbestos analysis, certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concepts and procedures need to be discussed in more depth. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information will help the analyst understand why some of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures are carried out the way they are. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
4.1. Light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Light is electromagnetic energy. It travels from its source in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packets called quanta. It is instructive to consider light as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plane wave. The light has a direction of travel. Perpendicular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this and mutually perpendicular to each other, are two vector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components. One is the magnetic vector and the other is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric vector. We shall only be concerned with the electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vector. In this description, the interaction of the vector and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mineral will describe all the observable phenomena. From a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light source such a microscope illuminator, light travels in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different direction from the filament. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any given direction away from the filament, the electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vector is perpendicular to the direction of travel of a light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ray. While perpendicular, its orientation is random about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
travel axis. If the electric vectors from all the light rays were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lined up by passing the light through a filter that would only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
let light rays with electric vectors oriented in one direction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass, the light would then be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
POLARIZED
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Polarized light interacts with matter in the direction of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric vector. This is the polarization direction. Using this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property it is possible to use polarized light to probe different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials and identify them by how they interact with light. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant at about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.99&times;108 m/s. When light travels in different materials such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as air, water, minerals or oil, it does not travel at this speed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It travels slower. This slowing is a function of both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material through which the light is traveling and the wavelength 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or frequency of the light. In general, the more dense the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material, the slower the light travels. Also, generally, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher the frequency, the slower the light will travel. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to that in a material is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
called the index of refraction (n). It is usually measured at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
589 nm (the sodium D line). If white light (light containing all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the visible wavelengths) travels through a material, rays of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer wavelengths will travel faster than those of shorter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wavelengths, this separation is called dispersion. Dispersion is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used as an identifier of materials as described in Section 4.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
4.2. Material Properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Materials are either amorphous or crystalline. The difference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between these two descriptions depends on the positions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atoms in them. The atoms in amorphous materials are randomly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arranged with no long range order. An example of an amorphous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material is glass. The atoms in crystalline materials, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other hand, are in regular arrays and have long range order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the atoms can be found in highly predictable locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of crystalline material are salt, gold, and the asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minerals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is beyond the scope of this method to describe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different types of crystalline materials that can be found, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the full description of the classes into which they can fall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, some general crystallography is provided below to give a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foundation to the procedures described. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the exception of anthophyllite, all the asbestos minerals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
belong to the monoclinic crystal type. The unit cell is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basic repeating unit of the crystal and for monoclinic crystals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be described as having three unequal sides, two 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; angles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and one angle not equal to 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;. The orthorhombic group, of which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anthophyllite is a member has three unequal sides and three 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
angles. The unequal sides are a consequence of the complexity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fitting the different atoms into the unit cell. Although the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atoms are in a regular array, that array is not symmetrical in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all directions. There is long range order in the three major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directions of the crystal. However, the order is different in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the three directions. This has the effect that the index 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of refraction is different in each of the three directions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using polarized light, we can investigate the index of refraction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in each of the directions and identify the mineral or material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under investigation. The indices 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
b
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 are used to identify the lowest, middle, and highest index of refraction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively. The x direction, associated with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG 0024 unknown -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 is called the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fast axis. Conversely, the z direction is associated with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the slow direction. Crocidolite has 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 along the fiber length 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making it ``length-fast''. The remainder of the asbestos minerals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 axis along the fiber length. They are called ``length-slow''. This orientation to fiber length is used to aid in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4.3. Polarized Light Technique 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Polarized light microscopy as described in this section uses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase-polar microscope described in Section 3.2. A phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrast microscope is fitted with two polarizing elements, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below and one above the sample. The polarizers have their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polarization directions at right angles to each other. Depending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the tests performed, there may be a compensator between these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two polarizing elements. A compensator is a piece of mineral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with known properties that ``compensates'' for some deficiency in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the optical train. Light emerging from a polarizing element has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its electric vector pointing in the polarization direction of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
element. The light will not be subsequently transmitted through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a second element set at a right angle to the first element. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless the light is altered as it passes from one element to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other, there is no transmission of light.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Crystals which have different crystal regularity in two or three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
main directions are said to be anisotropic. They have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different index of refraction in each of the main directions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When such a crystal is inserted between the crossed polars, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field of view is no longer dark but shows the crystal in color. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The color depends on the properties of the crystal. The light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acts as if it travels through the crystal along the optical axes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a crystal optical axis were lined up along one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polarizing directions (either the polarizer or the analyzer) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light would appear to travel only in that direction, and it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blink out or go dark. The difference in degrees between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber direction and the angle at which it blinks out is called 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the angle of extinction. When this angle can be measured, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful in identifying the mineral. The procedure for measuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the angle of extinction is to first identify the polarization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direction in the microscope. A commercial alignment slide can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to establish the polarization directions or use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anthophyllite or another suitable mineral. This mineral has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zero degree angle of extinction and will go dark to extinction as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it aligns with the polarization directions. When a fiber of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anthophyllite has gone to extinction, align the eyepiece reticle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or graticule with the fiber so that there is a visual cue as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the direction of polarization in the field of view. Tape or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise secure the eyepiece in this position so it will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shift. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the polarization direction has been identified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field of view, move the particle of interest to the center of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field of view and align it with the polarization direction. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers, align the fiber along this direction. Note the angular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reading of the rotating stage. Looking at the particle, rotate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stage until the fiber goes dark or ``blinks out''. Again note 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reading of the stage. The difference in the first reading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the second is an angle of extinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The angle measured may vary as the orientation of the fiber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes about its long axis. Tables of mineralogical data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually report the maximum angle of extinction. Asbestos forming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minerals, when they exhibit an angle of extinction, usually do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
show an angle of extinction close to the reported maximum, or as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate depending on the substitution chemistry.

4.5. Crossed Polars With Compensator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When the optical axes of a crystal are not lined up along one of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the polarizing directions (either the polarizer or the analyzer) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the light travels along one axis and part travels along 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the other visible axis. This is characteristic of birefringent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The color depends on the difference of the two visible indices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of refraction and the thickness of the crystal. The maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference available is the difference between the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG 0024 unknown -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 axes. This maximum difference is usually tabulated as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
birefringence of the crystal.

For this test, align the fiber at 45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to the polarization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directions in order to maximize the contribution to each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
optical axes. The colors seen are called retardation colors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They arise from the recombination of light which has traveled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the two separate directions of the crystal. One of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rays is retarded behind the other since the light in that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direction travels slower. On recombination, some of the colors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which make up white light are enhanced by constructive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interference and some are suppressed by destructive interference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The result is a color dependent on the difference between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indices and the thickness of the crystal. The proper colors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thicknesses, and retardations are shown on a Michel-Levy chart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three items, retardation, thickness and birefringence are

Examination of the equation for asbestos minerals reveals that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the visible colors for almost all common asbestos minerals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber sizes are shades of gray and black. The eye is relatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poor at discriminating different shades of gray. It is very good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at discriminating different colors. In order to compensate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the low retardation, a compensator is added to the light train 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the polarization elements. The compensator used for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test is a gypsum plate of known thickness and birefringence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a compensator when oriented at 45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to the polarizer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direction, provides a retardation of 530 nm of the 530 nm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wavelength color. This enhances the red color and gives the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
background a characteristic red to red-magenta color. If this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``full-wave'' compensator is in place when the asbestos preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is inserted into the light train, the colors seen on the fibers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are quite different. Gypsum, like asbestos has a fast axis and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slow axis. When a fiber is aligned with its fast axis in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same direction as the fast axis of the gypsum plate, the ray 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vibrating in the slow direction is retarded by both the asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the gypsum. This results in a higher retardation than would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be present for either of the two minerals. The color seen is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second order blue. When the fiber is rotated 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rotating stage, the slow direction of the fiber is now aligned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the fast direction of the gypsum and the fast direction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fiber is aligned with the slow direction of the gypsum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, one ray vibrates faster in the fast direction of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gypsum, and slower in the slow direction of the fiber; the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ray will vibrate slower in the slow direction of the gypsum and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
faster in the fast direction of the fiber. In this case, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect is subtractive and the color seen is a first order yellow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As long as the fiber thickness does not add appreciably to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
color, the same basic colors will be seen for all asbestos types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except crocidolite. In crocidolite the colors will be weaker, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be in the opposite directions, and will be altered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blue absorption color natural to crocidolite. Hundreds of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials will give the same colors as asbestos, and therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this test is not definitive for asbestos. The test is useful in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discriminating against fiberglass or other amorphous fibers such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as some synthetic fibers. Certain synthetic fibers will show 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retardation colors different than asbestos; however, there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some forms of polyethylene and aramid which will show morphology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and retardation colors similar to asbestos minerals. This test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be supplemented with a positive identification test when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
birefringent fibers are present which can not be excluded by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
morphology. This test is relatively ineffective for use on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers less than 1

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

or SEM should be used if no larger bundles or fibers are visible.

4.6. Dispersion Staining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Dispersion microscopy or dispersion staining is the method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choice for the identification of asbestos in bulk materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Becke line analysis is used by some laboratories and yields the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same results as does dispersion staining for asbestos and can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in lieu of dispersion staining. Dispersion staining is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed on the same platform as the phase-polar analysis with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the analyzer and compensator removed. One polarizing element 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains to define the direction of the light so that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different indices of refraction of the fibers may be separately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined. Dispersion microscopy is a dark-field technique when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for asbestos. Particles are imaged with scattered light. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Light which is unscattered is blocked from reaching the eye 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either by the back field image mask in a McCrone objective or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
back field image mask in the phase condenser. The most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convenient method is to use the rotating phase condenser to move 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an oversized phase ring into place. The ideal size for this ring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is for the central disk to be just larger than the objective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entry aperture as viewed in the back focal plane. The larger the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disk, the less scattered light reaches the eye. This will have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effect of diminishing the intensity of dispersion color and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will shift the actual color seen. The colors seen vary even on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopes from the same manufacturer. This is due to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different bands of wavelength exclusion by different mask sizes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mask may either reside in the condenser or in the objective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
back focal plane. It is imperative that the analyst determine by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimentation with asbestos standards what the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colors should be for each asbestos type. The colors depend also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the temperature of the preparation and the exact chemistry of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the asbestos. Therefore, some slight differences from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards should be allowed. This is not a serious problem for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial asbestos uses. This technique is used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of the indices of refraction for fibers by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognition of color. There is no direct numerical readout of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the index of refraction. Correlation of color to actual index of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refraction is possible by referral to published conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tables. This is not necessary for the analysis of asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognition of appropriate colors along with the proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
morphology are deemed sufficient to identify the commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos minerals. Other techniques including SEM, TEM, and XRD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be required to provide additional information in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify other types of asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Make a preparation in the suspected matching high dispersion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oil, e.g., n=1.550 for chrysotile. Perform the preliminary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests to determine whether the fibers are birefringent or not. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Take note of the morphological character. Wavy fibers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicative of chrysotile while long, straight, thin, frayed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers are indicative of amphibole asbestos. This can aid in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection of the appropriate matching oil. The microscope is set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
up and the polarization direction is noted as in Section 4.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Align a fiber with the polarization direction. Note the color. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is the color parallel to the polarizer. Then rotate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber rotating the stage 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; so that the polarization direction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is across the fiber. This is the perpendicular position. Again 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
note the color. Both colors must be consistent with standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos minerals in the correct direction for a positive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of asbestos. If only one of the colors is correct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while the other is not, the identification is not positive. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the colors in both directions are bluish-white, the analyst has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chosen a matching index oil which is higher than the correct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matching oil, e.g. the analyst has used n = 1.620 where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chrysotile is present. The next lower oil (Section 3.5.) should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used to prepare another specimen. If the color in both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directions is yellow-white to straw-yellow-white, this indicates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the index of the oil is lower than the index of the fiber, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e.g. the preparation is in n = 1.550 while anthophyllite is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present. Select the next higher oil (Section 3.5.) and prepare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another slide. Continue in this fashion until a positive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of all asbestos species present has been made or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all possible asbestos species have been ruled out by negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in this test. Certain plant fibers can have similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispersion colors as asbestos. Take care to note and evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the morphology of the fibers or remove the plant fibers in pre-preparation. Coating material on the fibers such as
carbonate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vinyl may destroy the dispersion color. Usually, there will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some outcropping of fiber which will show the colors sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for identification. When this is not the case, treat the sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described in Section 3.3. and then perform dispersion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staining. Some samples will yield to Becke line analysis if they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are coated or electron microscopy can be used for identification.

This mandatory appendix specifies engineering controls and work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices that must be implemented by the employer during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automotive brake and clutch inspection, disassembly, repair, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembly operations. Proper use of these engineering controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and work practices will reduce employees' asbestos exposure below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the permissible exposure level during clutch and brake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection, disassembly, repair, and assembly operations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer shall institute engineering controls and work practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using either the method set forth in paragraph [A] or paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[B] of this appendix, or any other method which the employer can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate to be equivalent in terms of reducing employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to asbestos as defined and which meets the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in paragraph [C] of this appendix, for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities in which no more than 5 pairs of brakes or 5 clutches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are inspected, disassembled, reassembled and/or repaired per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
week, the method set forth in paragraph [D] of this appendix may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The enclosure shall be sealed tightly and thoroughly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspected for leaks before work begins on brake and clutch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection, disassembly, repair, and assembly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The enclosure shall be such that the worker can clearly see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operation and shall provide impermeable sleeves through which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the worker can handle the brake and clutch inspection, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disassembly, repair and assembly. The integrity of the sleeves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and ports shall be examined before work begins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A HEPA-filtered vacuum shall be employed to maintain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enclosure under negative pressure throughout the operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compressed-air may be used to remove asbestos fibers or particles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the enclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The HEPA vacuum shall be used first to loosen the asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing residue from the brake and clutch parts and then to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evacuate the loosened asbestos containing material from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enclosure and capture the material in the vacuum filter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The vacuum's filter, when full, shall be first wetted with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fine mist of water, then removed and placed immediately in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impermeable container, labeled according to paragraph (j)(2)(ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section and disposed of according to paragraph (k) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Any spills or releases of asbestos containing waste material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from inside of the enclosure or vacuum hose or vacuum filter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be immediately cleaned up and disposed of according to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) A catch basin shall be placed under the brake assembly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positioned to avoid splashes and spills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The reservoir shall contain water containing an organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvent or wetting agent. The flow of liquid shall be controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such that the brake assembly is gently flooded to prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos-containing brake dust from becoming airborne. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The aqueous solution shall be allowed to flow between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake drum and brake support before the drum is removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) After removing the brake drum, the wheel hub and back of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brake assembly shall be thoroughly wetted to suppress dust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The brake support plate, brake shoes and brake components 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to attach the brake shoes shall be thoroughly washed before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removing the old shoes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) In systems using filters, the filters, when full, shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first wetted with a fine mist of water, then removed and placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately in an impermeable container, labeled according to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section and disposed of according to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (k) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

so that it can be reproduced and has been demonstrated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures resulting from the equivalent method are equal to or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than the exposures which would result from the use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method described in paragraph [A] of this appendix. For purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of making this comparison, the employer shall assume that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures resulting from the use of the method described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph [A] of this appendix shall not exceed 0.004 f/cc, as

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Permissible exposure limits (PELS)_(1) Time-weighted average limit (TWA). The employer shall ensure that no
employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of asbestos in excess of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air as an
eight (8) hour time-weighted average (TWA), as determined by the method prescribed in Appendix A of this section,
or by an equivalent method.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Excursion limit. The employer shall ensure that no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of asbestos
in excess of 1.0 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (1 f/cc) as averaged over a sampling period of thirty (30) minutes,
as determined by the method prescribed in Appendix A of this section, or by an equivalent method.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Multi-employer worksites. (1) On multi-employer worksites, an employer performing work requiring the establishment
of a regulated area shall inform other employers on the site of the nature of the employer's work with asbestos and/or
PACM, of the existence of and requirements pertaining to regulated areas, and the measures taken to ensure that employees
of such other employers are not exposed to asbestos.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Asbestos hazards at a multi-employer work site shall be abated by the contractor who created or controls the source
of asbestos contamination. For example, if there is a significant breach of an enclosure containing Class I work,
the employer responsible for erecting the enclosure shall repair the breach immediately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In addition, all employers of employees exposed to asbestos hazards shall comply with applicable protective
provisions to protect their employees. For example, if employees working immediately adjacent to a Class I asbestos
job are exposed to asbestos due to the inadequate containment of such job, their employer shall either remove the employees
from the area until the enclosure breach is repaired; or perform an initial exposure assessment pursuant to (f)(1)
of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) All employers of employees working adjacent to regulated areas established by another employer on a multi-employer
work-site, shall take steps on a daily basis to ascertain the integrity of the enclosure and/or the effectiveness
of the control method relied on by the primary asbestos contractor to assure that asbestos fibers do not migrate to
such adjacent areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) All general contractors on a construction project which includes work covered by this standard shall be deemed
to exercise general supervisory authority over the work covered by this standard, even though the general contractor
is not qualified to serve as the asbestos ``competent person'' as defined by paragraph (b) of this section. As supervisor
of the entire project, the general contractor shall ascertain whether the asbestos contractor is in compliance with
this standard, and shall require such contractor to come into compliance with this standard when necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Regulated areas_(1) All Class I, II and III asbestos work shall be conducted within regulated areas. All other
operations covered by this standard shall be conducted within a regulated area where airborne concentrations of
asbestos exceed, or there is a reasonable possibility they may exceed a PEL. Regulated areas shall comply with the
requirements of paragraphs (2), (3),(4) and (5) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Demarcation. The regulated area shall be demarcated in any manner that minimizes the number of persons within
the area and protects persons outside the area from exposure to airborne concentrations of asbestos. Where critical
barriers or negative pressure enclosures are used, they may demarcate the regulated area. Signs shall be provided
and displayed pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (k)(6) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Access. Access to regulated areas shall be limited to authorized persons and to persons authorized by the Act or
regulations issued pursuant thereto.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Respirators. All persons entering a regulated area where employees are required pursuant to paragraph (h)(2)
of this section to wear respirators shall be supplied with a respirator selected in accordance with paragraph (h)(2)
of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Prohibited activities. The employer shall ensure that employees do not eat, drink, smoke, chew tobacco or gum,
or apply cosmetics in the regulated area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Competent Persons. The employer shall ensure that all asbestos work performed within regulated areas is supervised
by a competent person, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. The duties of the competent person are set out in
paragraph (o) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Exposure assessments and monitoring_(1) General monitoring criteria. (i) Each employer who has a workplace
of work operation where exposure monitoring is required under this section shall perform monitoring to determine
accurately the airborne concentrations of asbestos to which employees may be exposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Determinations of employee exposure shall be made from breathing zone air samples that are representative of
the 8-hour TWA and 30-minute short-term exposures of each employee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Representative 8-hour TWA employee exposure shall be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing
full-shift exposure for employees in each work area. Representative 30-minute short-term employee exposures shall
be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing 30 minute exposures associated with operations that
are most likely to produce exposures above the excursion limit for employees in each work area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Initial Exposure Assessment. (i) Each employer who has a workplace or work operation covered by this standard
shall ensure that a ``competent person'' conducts an exposure assessment immediately before or at the initiation
of the operation to ascertain expected exposures during that operation or workplace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment must be completed in time to comply with requirements which are triggered by exposure data or the lack
of a ``negative exposure assessment,'' and to provide information necessary to assure that all control systems planned
are appropriate for that operation and will work properly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Basis of Initial Exposure Assessment: The initial exposure assessment shall be based on data derived from the
following sources: (A) If feasible, the employer shall monitor employees and base the exposure assessment on the
results of exposure monitoring which is conducted pursuant to the criteria in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) In addition, the assessment shall include consideration of all observations, information or calculations which
indicate employee exposure to asbestos, including any previous monitoring conducted in the workplace, or of the
operations of the employer which indicate the levels of airborne asbestos likely to be encountered on the job. However,
the assessment may conclude that exposures are likely to be consistently below the PELs only as a conclusion of a ``negative
exposure assessment'' conducted pursuant to (f)(2)(iii) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) For Class I asbestos work, until the employer conducts exposure monitoring and documents that employees on that
job will not be exposed in excess of the PELs, or otherwise makes a negative exposure assessment pursuant to paragraph
(f)(2)(iii) of this section, the employer shall presume that employees are exposed in excess of the TWA and excursion
limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Negative Exposure Assessment: For any one specific asbestos job which will be performed by employees who have
been trained in compliance with the standard, the employer may demonstrate that employee exposures will be below
the PELs by data which conform to the following criteria; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Objective data demonstrating that the product or material containing asbestos minerals or the activity involving
such product or material cannot release airborne fibers in concentrations exceeding the TWA and excursion limit
under those work conditions having the greatest potential for releasing asbestos; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Where the employer has monitored prior asbestos jobs for the PEL and the excursion limit within 12 months of the
current or projected job, the monitoring and analysis were performed in compliance with the asbestos standard in
effect; and the data were obtained during work operations conducted under workplace conditions ``closely resembling''
the processes, type of material, control methods, work practices, and environmental conditions used and prevailing
in the employer's current operations, the operations were conducted by employees whose training and experience
are no more extensive than that of employees performing the current job, and these data show that under the conditions
prevailing and which will prevail in the current workplace there is a high degree of certainty that employee exposures
will not exceed the TWA and excursion limit; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The results of initial exposure monitoring of the current job made from breathing zone air samples that are representative
of the 8-hour TWA and 30-minute short-term exposures of each employee covering operations which are most likely during
the performance of the entire asbestos job to result in exposures over the PELs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Periodic monitoring. (i) Class I and II operations. The employer shall conduct daily monitoring that is representative
of the exposure of each employee who is assigned to work within a regulated area who is performing Class I or II work,
unless the employer pursuant to (f)(2)(iii) of this section, has made a negative exposure assessment for the entire
operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) All operations under the standard other than Class I and II operations. The employer shall conduct periodic monitoring
of all work where exposures are expected to exceed a PEL, at intervals sufficient to document the validity of the exposure
prediction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Exception: When all employees required to be monitored daily are equipped with supplied-air respirators operated
in the positive-pressure mode, the employer may dispense with the daily monitoring required by this paragraph. However,
employees performing Class I work using a control method which is not listed in paragraph (g)(4) (i), (ii), or (iii)
of this section or using a modification of a listed control method, shall continue to be monitored daily even if they
are equipped with supplied-air respirators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) (i) Termination of monitoring. If the periodic monitoring required by paragraph (f)(3) of this section reveals
that employee exposures, as indicated by statistically reliable measurement, are below the permissible exposure
limit and excursion limit the employer may discontinue monitoring for those employees whose exposures are represented
by such monitoring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Additional monitoring. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f) (2) and (3), and (f)(4) of this section,
the employer shall institute the exposure monitoring required under paragraph (f)(3) of this section whenever there
has been a change in process, control equipment, personnel or work practices that may result in new or additional exposures
above the permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit or when the employer has any reason to suspect that a change
may result in new or additional exposures above the permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit. Such additional
monitoring is required regardless of whether a ``negative exposure assessment'' was previously produced for a specific
job.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Observation of monitoring. (i) The employer shall provide affected employees and their designated representatives
an opportunity to observe any monitoring of employee exposure to asbestos conducted in accordance with this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When observation of the monitoring of employee exposure to asbestos requires entry into an area where the use
of protective clothing or equipment is required, the observer shall be provided with and be required to use such clothing
and equipment and shall comply with all other applicable safety and health procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Methods of compliance_(1) Engineering controls and work practices for all operations covered by this section.
The employer shall use the following engineering controls and work practices in all operations covered by this section,
regardless of the levels of exposure:

asbestos does not migrate from the regulated area:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Critical barriers shall be placed over all openings to the regulated area: or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The employer shall use another barrier or isolation method which prevents the migration of airborne asbestos
from the regulated area, as verified by perimeter area surveillance during each work shift at each boundary of the
regulated area, showing no visible asbestos dust; and perimeter area monitoring showing that clearance levels contained
in 40 CFR Part 763, Subpt. E, of the EPA Asbestos in Schools Rule are met, or that perimeter area levels, measured by (PCM)
are no more than background levels representing the same area before the asbestos work began. The results of such monitoring
shall be made known to the employer no later than 24 hours from the end of the work shift represented by such monitoring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For all Class I jobs, HVAC systems shall be isolated in the regulated area by sealing with a double layer of 6 mil

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Smoking in work areas. The employer shall ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees do not smoke in work areas where they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupationally exposed to asbestos because of activities in that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Communication of hazards. NOTE: This section applies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the communication of information concerning asbestos hazards in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction activities to facilitate compliance with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. Most asbestos-related construction activities involve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously installed building materials. Building owners often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are the only and/or best sources of information concerning them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, they, along with employers of potentially exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees, are assigned specific information conveying and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retention duties under this section. Installed Asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Containing Building Material. Employers and building owners are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to treat TSI and sprayed or troweled on surfacing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials in buildings as asbestos-containing, unless they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine in compliance with paragraph (k)(4) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the material is not asbestos-containing. Asphalt and vinyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flooring material installed no later than 1980 must also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered as asbestos containing unless the employer, pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to paragraph (g) of this section determines that it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos-containing. If the employer/building owner has actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowledge, or should have known through the exercise of due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diligence, that other materials are asbestos-containing, they too 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be treated as such. When communicating information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees pursuant to this standard, owners and employers shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify ``PACM'' as ACM. Additional requirements relating to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication of asbestos work on multi-employer worksites are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set out in paragraph (d) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Duties of building and facility owners. (i) Before work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to this standard is begun, building and facility owners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall identify the presence, location and quantity of ACM, and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PACM at the work site. All thermal system insulation and sprayed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on or troweled on surfacing m2aterials in buildings or substrates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constructed no later than 1980 shall also be identified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos-containing. In addition resilient flooring material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed not later than 1980 shall also be identified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos-containing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Building and/or facility owners shall notify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following persons of the presence, location and quantity of ACM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or PACM, at the work sites in their buildings and facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notification either shall be in writing, or shall consist of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal communication between the owner and the person to whom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification must be given or their authorized representatives: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Prospective employers applying or bidding for work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose employees reasonably can be expected to work in or adjacent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to areas containing such material; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Employees of the owner who will work in or adjacent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas containing such material: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) On multi-employer worksites, all employers of employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who will be performing work within or adjacent to areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing such materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Tenants who will occupy areas containing such material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Duties of employers whose employees perform work subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this standard in or adjacent to areas containing ACM and PACM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building/facility owners whose employees perform such work shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with these provisions to the extent applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Before work in areas containing ACM and PACM is begun; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers shall identify the presence, location, and quantity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACM, and/or PACM therein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Before work under this standard is performed employers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of employees who will perform such work shall inform the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following persons of the location and quantity of ACM and/or PACM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present in the area and the precautions to be taken to insure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that airborne asbestos is confined to the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Owners of the building/facility; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Employees who will perform such work and employers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees who work and/or will be working in adjacent areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Within 10 days of the completion of such work, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer whose employees have performed work subject to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, shall inform the building/facility owner and employers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of employees who will be working in the area of the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location and quantity of PACM and/or ACM remaining in the area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and final monitoring results, if any. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In addition to the above requirements, all employers who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discover ACM and/or PACM on a worksite shall convey information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the presence, location and quantity of such newly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discovered ACM and/or PACM to the owner and to other employers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees working at the work site, within 24 hours of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Criteria to rebut the designation of installed material as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PACM. (i) At any time, an employer and/or building owner may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate, for purposes of this standard, that PACM does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain asbestos. Building owners and/or employers are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to communicate information about the presence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building material for which such a demonstration pursuant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of paragraph (k)(4)(ii) of this section has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made. However, in all such cases, the information, data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis supporting the determination that PACM does not contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos, shall be retained pursuant to paragraph (n) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An employer or owner may demonstrate that PACM does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not contain asbestos by the following: (A) Having an completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection conducted pursuant to the requirements of AHERA (40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR Part 763, Subpart E) which demonstrates that the material is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not ACM; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Performing tests of the material containing PACM which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that no asbestos is present in the material. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests shall include analysis of 3 bulk samples of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
homogeneous area of PACM collected in a randomly distributed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner. The tests, evaluation and sample collection shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted by an accredited inspector or by a CIH. Analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples shall be performed by persons or laboratories with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proficiency demonstrated by current successful participation in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationally recognized testing program such as the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Round Robin for bulk samples administered by the American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) or an equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationally-recognized round robin testing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) At the entrance to mechanical rooms/areas in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees reasonably can be expected to enter and which contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal system insulation and surfacing ACM/PACM, the building 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner shall post signs which identify the material which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present, its location, and appropriate work practices which, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
followed, will ensure that ACM and/or PACM will not be disturbed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Signs. (i) Warning signs that demarcate the regulated area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be provided and displayed at each location where a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated area is required to be established by paragraph (e) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section. Signs shall be posted at such a distance from such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a location that an employee may read the signs and take necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective steps before entering the area marked by the signs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The warning signs required by (k)(6) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(k)(2)(i) through (k)(2)(iii) do not apply where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Asbestos fibers have been modified by a bonding agent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coating, binder, or other material, provided that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer can demonstrate that, during any reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreseeable use, handling, storage, disposal, processing, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation, no airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess of the permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The training program shall be conducted in a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the employee is able to understand. In addition to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content required by provisions in paragraph (k)(8)(iii) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, the employer shall ensure that each such employee is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informed of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This method describes the collection of airborne asbestos fibers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using calibrated sampling pumps with mixed-cellulose ester (MCE) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filters and analysis by phase contrast microscopy (PCM). Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms used are unique to this method and are defined below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Asbestos:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A term for naturally occurring fibrous minerals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos includes chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(cummingtonite-grunerite asbestos), tremolite asbestos, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actinolite asbestos, anthophyllite asbestos, and any of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minerals that have been chemically treated and/or altered. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precise chemical formulation of each species will vary with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location from which it was mined. Nominal compositions are

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.1. History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Early surveys to determine asbestos exposures were conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using impinger counts of total dust with the counts expressed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million particles per cubic foot. The British Asbestos Research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council recommended filter membrane counting in 1969. In July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1969, the Bureau of Occupational Safety and Health published a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filter membrane method for counting asbestos fibers in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. This method was refined by NIOSH and published as P &amp; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CAM 239. On May 29, 1971, OSHA specified filter membrane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling with phase contrast counting for evaluation of asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures at work sites in the United States. The use of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technique was again required by OSHA in 1986. Phase contrast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopy has continued to be the method of choice for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement of occupational exposure to asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.2. Principle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Air is drawn through a MCE filter to capture airborne asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers. A wedge shaped portion of the filter is removed, placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a glass microscope slide and made transparent. A measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area (field) is viewed by PCM. All the fibers meeting a defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for asbestos are counted and considered a measure of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airborne asbestos concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.3. Advantages and Disadvantages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
There are four main advantages of PCM over other methods: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The technique is specific for fibers. Phase contrast is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber counting technique which excludes non-fibrous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particles from the analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The technique is inexpensive and does not require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specialized knowledge to carry out the analysis for total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber counts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The analysis is quick and can be performed on-site for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rapid determination of air concentrations of asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The technique has continuity with historical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epidemiological studies so that estimates of expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease can be inferred from long-term determinations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The main disadvantage of PCM is that it does not positively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify asbestos fibers. Other fibers which are not asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be included in the count unless differential counting is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed. This requires a great deal of experience to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately differentiate asbestos from non-asbestos fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Positive identification of asbestos must be performed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polarized light or electron microscopy techniques. A further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disadvantage of PCM is that the smallest visible fibers are about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.2 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m in diameter while the finest asbestos fibers may be as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small as 0.02 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m in diameter. For some exposures, substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more fibers may be present than are actually counted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.4. Workplace Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos is used by the construction industry in such products as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shingles, floor tiles, asbestos cement, roofing felts, insulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and acoustical products. Non-construction uses include brakes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clutch facings, paper, paints, plastics, and fabrics. One of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most significant exposures in the workplace is the removal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encapsulation of asbestos in schools, public buildings, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
homes. Many workers have the potential to be exposed to asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during these operations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
About 95% of the asbestos in commercial use in the United States is chrysotile. Crocidolite and amosite make up most
of the remainder. Anthophyllite and tremolite or actinolite are likely to be encountered as contaminants in various
industrial products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.5. Physical Properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos fiber possesses a high tensile strength along its axis, is chemically inert, non-combustible, and heat
resistant. It has a high electrical resistance and good sound absorbing properties. It can be weaved into cables,
fabrics or other textiles, and also matted into asbestos papers, felts, or mats.

2.1. The ideal counting range on the filter is 100 to 1,300 fibers/mm2. With a Walton-Beckett graticule this range
is equivalent to 0.8 to 10 fibers/field. Using NIOSH counting statistics, a count of 0.8 fibers/field would give an
approximate coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.13. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.2. The detection limit for this method is 4.0 fibers per 100 fields or 5.5 fibers/mm2. This was determined using an
equation to estimate the maximum CV possible at a specific concentration (95% confidence) and a Lower Control Limit
of zero. The CV value was then used to determine a corresponding concentration from historical CV vs fiber relationships.
As an example:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->
Lower Control Limit (95% Confidence) = AC_1.645(CV)(AC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AC=Estimate of the airborne fiber concentration (fibers/cc) Setting the Lower Control Limit=0 and solving for CV:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0=AC_1.645(CV)(AC) CV=0.61 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This value was compared with CV vs. count curves. The count at which CV = 0.61 for Leidel-Busch counting statistics
or for an OSHA Salt Lake Technical Center (OSHA&hyph;SLTC) CV curve (see Appendix A for further information) was 4.4
fibers or 3.9 fibers per 100 fields, respectively. Although a lower detection limit of 4 fibers per 100 fields is supported
by the OSHA&hyph;SLTC data, both data sets support the 4.5 fibers per 100 fields value.

3. Method Performance_Precision and Accuracy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Precision is dependent upon the total number of fibers counted and the uniformity of the fiber distribution on the
filter. A general rule is to count at least 20 and not more than 100 fields. The count is discontinued when 100 fibers
are counted, provided that 20 fields have already been counted. Counting more than 100 fibers results in only a small
gain in precision. As the total count drops below 10 fibers, an accelerated loss of precision is noted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, there is no known method to determine the absolute accuracy of the asbestos analysis. Results of samples
prepared through the Proficiency Analytical Testing (PAT) Program and analyzed by the OSHA&hyph;SLTC showed no
significant bias when compared to PAT reference values. The PAT samples were analyzed from 1987 to 1989 (N=36) and
the concentration range was from 120 to 1,300 fibers/mm2.

5.2.4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Select an appropriate flow rate for the situation being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitored. The sampling flow rate must be between 0.5 and 5.0 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
L/min for personal sampling and is commonly set between 1 and 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
L/min. Always choose a flow rate that will not produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overloaded filters.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
5.2.5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Calibrate each sampling pump before and after sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a calibration cassette in-line (Note: This calibration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cassette should be from the same lot of cassettes used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling). Use a primary standard (e.g. bubble burette) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibrate each pump. If possible, calibrate at the sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site.

extent is dependent on the type of pump used. Consult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the pump manufacturer to determine dependence on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental influences. If the pump is affected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Connect each pump to the base of each sampling cassette 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with flexible tubing. Remove the end cap of each cassette and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take each air sample open face. Assure that each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample cassette is held open side down in the employee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breathing zone during sampling. The distance from the nose/mouth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the employee to the cassette should be about 10 cm. Secure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cassette on the collar or lapel of the employee using spring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clips or other similar devices.

CAUTION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Do not overload the filter with dust. High levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-fibrous dust particles may obscure fibers on the filter and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower the count or make counting impossible. If more than about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25 to 30% of the field area is obscured with dust, the result may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be biased low. Smaller air volumes may be necessary when there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is excessive non-asbestos dust in the air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While sampling, observe the filter with a small flashlight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there is a visible layer of dust on the filter, stop sampling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove and seal the cassette, and replace with a new sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembly. The total dust loading should not exceed 1 mg.

Blank samples are used to determine if any contamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has occurred during sample handling. Prepare two blanks for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first 1 to 20 samples. For sets containing greater than 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples, prepare blanks as 10% of the samples. Handle blank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples in the same manner as air samples with one exception: Do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not draw any air through the blank samples. Open the blank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cassette in the place where the sample cassettes are mounted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employee. Hold it open for about 30 seconds. Close and seal

6.4. Standard Preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A way to prepare standard asbestos samples of known concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has not been developed. It is possible to prepare replicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples of nearly equal concentration. This has been performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the PAT program. These asbestos samples are distributed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the AIHA to participating laboratories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since only about one-fourth of a 25-mm sample membrane is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for an asbestos count, any PAT sample can serve as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``standard'' for replicate counting.

The objective is to produce samples with a smooth (non-grainy) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
background in a medium with a refractive index of approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.46. The technique below collapses the filter for easier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focusing and produces permanent mounts which are useful for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality control and interlaboratory comparison.

With a rocking motion cut a triangular wedge from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filter using the scalpel. This wedge should be one-sixth to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-fourth of the filter. Grasp the filter wedge with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forceps on the perimeter of the filter which was clamped between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cassette pieces. DO NOT TOUCH the filter with your finger. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Place the filter on the glass slide sample side up. Static 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electricity will usually keep the filter on the slide until it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleared.

the block with slow, steady pressure on the plunger while holding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pipette firmly in place. Wait 3 to 5 seconds for the filter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

contrast between the fibers and the preparation. This may also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead to separation of the cover slip from the slide).

Lower a cover slip gently onto the filter at a slight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
angle to reduce the possibility of forming air bubbles. If more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 30 seconds have elapsed between acetone exposure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triacetin application, glue the edges of the cover slip to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slide with lacquer or nail polish.

If clearing is slow, warm the slide for 15 min on a hot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plate having a surface temperature of about 50
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C to hasten 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearing. The top of the hot block can be used if the slide is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not heated too long.

6.6. Sample Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Completely align the microscope according to the manufacturer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions. Then, align the microscope using the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general alignment routine at the beginning of every counting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
session and more often if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
6.6.1. Alignment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Clean all optical surfaces. Even a small amount of dirt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can significantly degrade the image. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Rough focus the objective on a sample.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Close down the field iris so that it is visible in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field of view. Focus the image of the iris with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condenser focus. Center the image of the iris in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field of view. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Install the phase telescope and focus on the phase rings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critically center the rings. Misalignment of the rings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in astigmatism which will degrade the image. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Place the phase-shift test slide on the microscope stage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and focus on the lines. The analyst must see line set 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and should see at least parts of 4 and 5 but, not see line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set 6 or 6. A microscope/microscopist combination which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not pass this test may not be used.

6.6.2. Counting Fibers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Place the prepared sample slide on the mechanical stage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the microscope. Position the center of the wedge under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the objective lens and focus upon the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Start counting from one end of the wedge and progress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
along a radial line to the other end (count in either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direction from perimeter to wedge tip). Select fields 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
randomly, without looking into the eyepieces, by slightly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advancing the slide in one direction with the mechanical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stage control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Continually scan over a range of focal planes (generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the upper 10 to 15 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m of the filter surface) with the fine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focus control during each field count. Spend at least 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 15 seconds per field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Most samples will contain asbestos fibers with fiber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diameters less than 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m. Look carefully for faint fiber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
images. The small diameter fibers will be very hard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
see. However, they are an important contribution to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total count. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Count only fibers equal to or longer than 5 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m. Measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the length of curved fibers along the curve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Count fibers which have a length to width ratio of 3:1 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Count all the fibers in at least 20 fields. Continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counting until either 100 fibers are counted or 100 fields 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been viewed; whichever occurs first. Count all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers in the final field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Fibers lying entirely within the boundary of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Walton-Beckett graticule field shall receive a count of 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fibers crossing the boundary once, having one end within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the circle shall receive a count of 1/2. Do not count any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber that crosses the graticule boundary more than once. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reject and do not count any other fibers even though they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be visible outside the graticule area. If a fiber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
touches the circle, it is considered to cross the line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Count bundles of fibers as one fiber unless individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers can be clearly identified and each individual fiber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is clearly not connected to another counted fiber. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Figure 2 for counting conventions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Record the number of fibers in each field in a consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way such that filter non-uniformity can be assessed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Regularly check phase ring alignment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) When an agglomerate (mass of material) covers more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25% of the field of view, reject the field and select 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another. Do not include it in the number of fields 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) Perform a ``blind recount'' of 1 in every 10 filter wedges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(slides). Re-label the slides using a person other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the original counter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously mentioned in Section 1.3., PCM does not provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive confirmation of asbestos fibers. Alternate differential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counting techniques should be used if discrimination is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desirable. Differential counting may include primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination based on morphology, polarized light analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers, or modification of PCM data by Scanning Electron or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transmission Electron Microscopy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A great deal of experience is required to routinely and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correctly perform differential counting. It is discouraged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless it is legally necessary. Then, only if a fiber is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obviously not asbestos should it be excluded from the count. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further discussion of this technique can be found in reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All individuals performing asbestos analysis must have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken the NIOSH course for sampling and evaluating airborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos or an equivalent course. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Each laboratory engaged in asbestos counting shall set up 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a slide trading arrangement with at least two other laboratories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to compare performance and eliminate inbreeding of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
error. The slide exchange occurs at least semiannually. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
round robin results shall be posted where all analysts can view 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual analyst's results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
6.8.3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Each laboratory engaged in asbestos counting shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the Proficiency Analytical Testing Program, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos Analyst Registry or equivalent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
6.8.4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Each analyst shall select and count prepared slides from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a ``slide bank''. These are quality assurance counts. The slide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bank shall be prepared using uniformly distributed samples taken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the workload. Fiber densities should cover the entire range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routinely analyzed by the laboratory. These slides are counted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blind by all counters to establish an original standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation. This historical distribution is compared with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality assurance counts. A counter must have 95% of all quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control samples counted within three standard deviations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical mean. This count is then integrated into a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical mean and standard deviation for the slide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analyses done by the counters to establish the slide bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be used for an interim quality control program if the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are treated in a proper statistical fashion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The collection area of a filter is seldom equal to 385 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mm2. It is appropriate for laboratories to routinely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor the exact diameter using an inside micrometer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection area is calculated according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formula:

7.2. Short-Cut Calculation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since a given analyst always has the same interpupillary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distance, the number of fields per filter for a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyst will remain constant for a given size filter. The field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size for that analyst is constant (i.e. the analyst is using an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned microscope and is not changing the reticle). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, if the exposed area of the filter is always 385 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mm2 and the size of the field is always 0.00785 mm
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of fields per filter will always be 49,000. In addition it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to convert liters of air to cc. These three constants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can then be combined such that ECA/(1,000&times;MFA)=49. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous equation simplifies to:

7.3. Recount Calculations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned in step 13 of Section 6.6.2., a ``blind recount'' of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10% of the slides is performed. In all cases, differences will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be observed between the first and second counts of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filter wedge. Most of these differences will be due to chance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alone, that is, due to the random variability (precision) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
count method. Statistical recount criteria enables one to decide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether observed differences can be explained due to chance alone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or are probably due to systematic differences between analysts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopes, or other biasing factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following recount criterion is for a pair of counts that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate AC in fibers/cc. The criterion is given at the type-I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
error level. That is, there is 5% maximum risk that we will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reject a pair of counts for the reason that one might be biased, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the large observed difference is really due to chance.

the results can be rejected for cause.

Quality Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The OSHA asbestos regulations require each laboratory to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a quality control program. The following is presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as an example of how the OSHA&hyph;SLTC constructed its internal CV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
curve as part of meeting this requirement. Data for the CV curve shown below is from 395 samples collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during OSHA compliance inspections and analyzed from October 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through April 1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each sample was counted by 2 to 5 different counters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independently of one another. The standard deviation and the CV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistic was calculated for each sample. This data was then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plotted on a graph of CV vs. fibers/mm2. A least squares 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regression was performed using the following equation:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When ordering the Graticule for asbestos counting, specify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exact disc diameter needed to fit the ocular of the microscope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the diameter (mm) of the circular counting area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instructions for measuring the dimensions necessary are listed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Insert any available graticule into the focusing eyepiece 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and focus so that the graticule lines are sharp and clear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Align the microscope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Place a stage micrometer on the microscope object stage and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focus the microscope on the graduated lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Measure the magnified grid length, PL (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m), using the stage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
micrometer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Remove the graticule from the microscope and measure its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual grid length, AL (mm). This can be accomplished by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using a mechanical stage fitted with verniers, or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeweler's loupe with a direct reading scale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Appendix F to &sect;1926.1101. Work Practices and Engineering Controls for Class I Asbestos Operations._Non-mandatory

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
This is a non-mandatory appendix to the asbestos standards for construction and for shipyards. It describes criteria
and procedures for erecting and using negative pressure enclosures for Class I Asbestos Work, when NPEs are used as
an allowable control method to comply with paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section. Many small and variable details are
involved in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
erection of a negative pressure enclosure. OSHA and most participants in the rulemaking agreed that only the major,
more performance oriented criteria should be made mandatory. These criteria are set out in paragraph (g) of this section.
In addition, this appendix includes these mandatory specifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and procedures in its guidelines in order to make this appendix coherent and helpful. The mandatory nature of the criteria
which appear in the regulatory text is not changed because they are included in this ``non-mandatory'' appendix.
Similarly, the additional criteria and procedures included as guidelines in the appendix, do not become mandatory
because mandatory criteria are also included in these comprehensive guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, none of the criteria, both mandatory and recommended, are meant to specify or imply the need for use of
patented or licensed methods or equipment. Recommended specifications included in this attachment should not discourage
the use of creative alternatives which can be shown to reliably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve the objectives of negative-pressure enclosures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements included in this appendix, cover general provisions to be followed in all asbestos jobs, provisions
which must be followed for all Class I asbestos jobs, and provisions governing the construction and testing of negative
pressure enclosures. The first category includes the requirement for use of wet methods, HEPA vacuums, and immediate
bagging of waste; Class I work must conform to the following provisions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;oversight by competent person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;use of critical barriers over all openings to work area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;isolation of HVAC systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;use of impermeable dropcloths and coverage of all objects within regulated areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, more specific requirements for NPEs include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;maintenance of ^0.02 inches water gauge within enclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;manometric measurements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;air movement away from employees performing removal work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;smoke testing or equivalent for detection of leaks and air direction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;deactivation of electrical circuits, if not provided with ground-fault circuit interrupters.

Planning the Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
The standard requires that an exposure assessment be conducted before the asbestos job is begun [&sect;1926.1101
(f)(1)]. Information needed for that assessment, includes data relating to prior similar jobs, as applied to the
specific variables of the current job. The information needed to conduct the assessment will be useful in planning
the project, and in complying with any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting requirements under this standard, when significant changes are being made to a control system listed in
the standard, [see also those of USEPA (40 CFR 61, subpart M). Thus, although the standard does not explicitly require
the preparation of a written asbestos removal plan, the usual constituents of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a plan, i.e., a description of the enclosure, the equipment, and the procedures to be used throughout the project,
must be determined before the enclosure can be erected. The following information should be included in the planning
of the system:

Materials and Equipment Necessary for Asbestos Removal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Although individual asbestos removal projects vary in terms of the equipment required to accomplish the removal
of the materials, some equipment and materials are common to most asbestos removal operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plastic sheeting used to protect horizontal surfaces, seal HVAC openings or to seal vertical openings and ceilings
should have a minimum thickness of 6 mils. Tape or other adhesive used to attach plastic sheeting should be of sufficient
adhesive strength to support the weight of the material plus all stresses encountered during the entire duration
of the project without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
becoming detached from the surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other equipment and materials which should be available at the beginning of each project are: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=4 -->
_HEPA Filtered Vacuum is essential for cleaning the work area after the asbestos has been removed. It should have a
long hose capable of reaching out-of-the-way places, such as areas above ceiling tiles, behind pipes, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Portable air ventilation systems installed to provide the negative air pressure and air removal from the enclosure
must be equipped with a HEPA filter. The number and capacity of units required to ventilate an enclosure depend on the
size of the area to be ventilated. The filters for these systems should be designed in such a manner that they can be replaced
when the air flow volume is reduced by the build-up of dust in the filtration material. Pressure monitoring devices
with alarms and strip chart recorders attached 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to each system to indicate the pressure differential and the loss due to dust buildup on the filter are recommended.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Water sprayers should be used to keep the asbestos material as saturated as possible during removal; the sprayers
will provide a fine mist that minimizes the impact of the spray on the material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Water used to saturate the asbestos containing material can be amended by adding at least 15 milliliters (1/4 ounce)
of wetting agent in 1 liter (1 pint) of water. An example of a wetting agent is a 50/50 mixture of polyoxyethylene ether
and polyoxyethylene polyglycol ester.

_Backup power supplies are recommended, especially for ventilation systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Shower and bath water should be with mixed hot and cold water faucets. Water that has been used to clean personnel or
equipment should either be filtered or be collected and discarded as asbestos waste. Soap and shampoo should be provided
to aid in removing dust from the workers' skin and hair.

Preparing the Work Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Disabling HVAC Systems: The power to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems that service the restricted
area must be deactivated and locked off. All ducts, grills, access ports, windows and vents must be sealed off with
two layers of plastic to prevent entrainment of contaminated air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating HVAC Systems in the Restricted Area: If components of a HVAC system located in the restricted area are connected
to a system that will service another zone during the project, the portion of the duct in the restricted area must be
sealed and pressurized. Necessary precautions include caulking the duct joints, covering all cracks and openings
with two layers of sheeting, and pressurizing the duct throughout the duration of the project by restricting the return
air flow. The power to the fan supplying the positive pressure should be locked ``on'' to prevent pressure loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sealing Elevators: If an elevator shaft is located in the restricted area, it should be either shut down or isolated
by sealing with two layers of plastic sheeting. The sheeting should provide enough slack to accommodate the pressure
changes in the shaft without breaking the air-tight seal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Removing Mobile Objects: All movable objects should be cleaned and removed from the work area before an enclosure
is constructed unless moving the objects creates a hazard. Mobile objects will be assumed to be contaminated and should
be either cleaned with amended water and a HEPA vacuum and then removed from the area or wrapped and then disposed of
as hazardous waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cleaning and Sealing Surfaces: After cleaning with water and a HEPA vacuum, surfaces of stationary objects should
be covered with two layers of plastic sheeting. The sheeting should be secured with duct tape or an equivalent method
to provide a tight seal around the object. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bagging Waste: In addition to the requirement for immediate bagging of waste for disposal, it is further recommended
that the waste material be double-bagged and sealed in plastic bags designed for asbestos disposal. The bags should
be stored in a waste storage area that can be controlled by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers conducting the removal. Filters removed from air handling units and rubbish removed from the area are to be
bagged and handled as hazardous waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=4 -->
Constructing the Enclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
The enclosure should be constructed to provide an air-tight seal around ducts and openings into existing ventilation
systems and around penetrations for electrical conduits, telephone wires, water lines, drain pipes, etc. Enclosures
should be both airtight and watertight except for those openings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to provide entry and/or air flow control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Size: An enclosure should be the minimum volume to encompass all of the working surfaces yet allow unencumbered movement
by the worker(s), provide unrestricted air flow past the worker(s), and ensure walking surfaces can be kept free of
tripping hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shape: The enclosure may be any shape that optimizes the flow of ventilation air past the worker(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Structural Integrity: The walls, ceilings and floors must be supported in such a manner that portions of the enclosure
will not fall down during normal use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Openings: It is not necessary that the structure be airtight; openings may be designed to direct air flow. Such openings
should be located at a distance from active removal operations. They should be designed to draw air into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enclosure under all anticipated circumstances. In the event that negative pressure is lost, they should be fitted
with either HEPA filters to trap dust or automatic trap doors that prevent dust from escaping the enclosure. Openings
for exits should be controlled by an airlock or a vestibule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Barrier Supports: Frames should be constructed to support all unsupported spans of sheeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sheeting: Walls, barriers, ceilings, and floors should be lined with two layers of plastic sheeting having a thickness
of at least 6 mil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Seams: Seams in the sheeting material should be minimized to reduce the possibilities of accidental rips and tears
in the adhesive or connections. All seams in the sheeting should overlap, be staggered and not be located at corners
or wall-to-floor joints. Areas Within an Enclosure: Each enclosure consists of a work area, a decontamination area,
and waste storage area. The work area where the asbestos removal operations occur should be separated from both the
waste storage area and the contamination control area by physical curtains, doors, and/or airflow patterns that
force any airborne contamination back into the work area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
See paragraph (j) of this section for requirements for hygiene facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During egress from the work area, each worker should step into the equipment room, clean tools and equipment, and remove
gross contamination from clothing by wet cleaning and HEPA vacuuming. Before entering the shower area, foot coverings,
head coverings, hand coverings, and coveralls are removed and placed in impervious bags for disposal or cleaning.
Airline connections from airline respirators with HEPA disconnects and power cables from powered air-purifying
respirators (PAPRs) will be disconnected just prior to entering the shower room. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=4 -->
Establishing Negative Pressure Within the Enclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Negative Pressure: Air is to be drawn into the enclosure under all anticipated conditions and exhausted through a
HEPA filter for 24 hours a day during the entire duration of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Flow Tests: Air flow patterns will be checked before removal operations begin, at least once per operating shift
and any time there is a question regarding the integrity of the enclosure. The primary test for air flow is to trace air
currents with smoke tubes or other visual methods. Flow checks are made at each opening and at each doorway to demonstrate
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air is being drawn into the enclosure and at each worker's position to show that air is being drawn away from the breathing
zone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring Pressure Within the Enclosure: After the initial air flow patterns have been checked, the static pressure
must be monitored within the enclosure. Monitoring may be made using manometers, pressure gauges, or combinations
of these devices. It is recommended that they be attached to alarms and strip chart recorders at points identified
by the design engineer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corrective Actions: If the manometers or pressure gauges demonstrate a reduction in pressure differential below
the required level, work should cease and the reason for the change investigated and appropriate changes made. The
air flow patterns should be retested before work begins again. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pressure Differential: The design parameters for static pressure differentials between the inside and outside
of enclosures typically range from 0.02 to 0.10 inches of water gauge, depending on conditions. All zones inside the
enclosure must have less pressure than the ambient pressure outside of the enclosure (^0.02 inches water gauge differential).
Design specifications for the differential vary according to the size, configuration, and shape of the enclosure
as well as ambient and mechanical air pressure conditions around the enclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Flow Patterns: The flow of air past each worker shall be enhanced by positioning the intakes and exhaust ports to
remove contaminated air from the worker's breathing zone, by positioning HEPA vacuum cleaners to draw air from the
worker's breathing zone, by forcing relatively uncontaminated air past the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worker toward an exhaust port, or by using a combination of methods to reduce the worker's exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Handling Unit Exhaust: The exhaust plume from air handling units should be located away from adjacent personnel
and intakes for HVAC systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Flow Volume: The air flow volume (cubic meters per minute) exhausted (removed) from the workplace must exceed
the amount of makeup air supplied to the enclosure. The rate of air exhausted from the enclosure should be designed
to maintain a negative pressure in the enclosure and air movement past each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worker. The volume of air flow removed from the enclosure should replace the volume of the container at every 5 to 15
minutes. Air flow volume will need to be relatively high for large enclosures, enclosures with awkward shapes, enclosures
with multiple openings, and operations employing several workers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the enclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Flow Velocity: At each opening, the air flow velocity must visibly ``drag'' air into the enclosure. The velocity
of air flow within the enclosure must be adequate to remove airborne contamination from each worker's breathing zone
without disturbing the asbestos-containing material on surfaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airlocks: Airlocks are mechanisms on doors and curtains that control the air flow patterns in the doorways. If air
flow occurs, the patterns through doorways must be such that the air flows toward the inside of the enclosure. Sometimes
vestibules, double doors, or double curtains are used to prevent air movement through the doorways. To use a vestibule,
a worker enters a chamber by opening the door or curtain and then closing the entry before opening the exit door or curtain.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airlocks should be located between the equipment room and shower room, between the shower room and the clean room,
and between the waste storage area and the outside of the enclosure. The air flow between adjacent rooms must be checked
using smoke tubes or other visual tests to ensure the flow patterns draw air toward the work area without producing
eddies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
In addition to the breathing zone samples taken as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outlined in paragraph (f) of this section, samples of air should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be taken to demonstrate the integrity of the enclosure, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleanliness of the clean room and shower area, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of the HEPA filter. If the clean room is shown to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be contaminated, the room must be relocated to an uncontaminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Samples taken near the exhaust of portable ventilation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems must be done with care.

General Work Practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Preventing dust dispersion is the primary means of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling the spread of asbestos within the enclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whenever practical, the point of removal should be isolated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enclosed, covered, or shielded from the workers in the area. Waste asbestos containing materials must be bagged during
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately after removal; the material must remain saturated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until the waste container is sealed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste material with sharp points or corners must be placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in hard air-tight containers rather than bags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whenever possible, large components should be sealed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plastic sheeting and removed intact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bags or containers of waste will be moved to the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holding area, washed, and wrapped in a bag with the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=4 -->
Cleaning the Work Area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Surfaces within the work area should be kept free of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visible dust and debris to the extent feasible. Whenever visible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dust appears on surfaces, the surfaces within the enclosure must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be cleaned by wiping with a wet sponge, brush, or cloth and then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuumed with a HEPA vacuum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All surfaces within the enclosure should be cleaned before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exhaust ventilation system is deactivated and the enclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is disassembled. An approved encapsulate may be sprayed onto 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas after the visible dust has been removed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=4 -->
Appendix H to &sect;1915.1001_Substance Technical Information for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos. Non-Mandatory
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=4 -->
I. Substance Identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
A. Substance: ``Asbestos'' is the name of a class of magnesium-silicate minerals that occur in fibrous form. Minerals
that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in this group are chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anthophyllite asbestos, tremolite asbestos, and actinolite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Asbestos is and was used in the manufacture of heat-resistant clothing, automotive brake and clutch linings, and
a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variety of building materials including floor tiles, roofing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
felts, ceiling tiles, asbestos-cement pipe and sheet, and fire-resistant drywall. Asbestos is also present in pipe
and boiler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insulation materials and in sprayed-on materials located on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beams, in crawlspaces, and between walls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The potential for an asbestos-containing product to release 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breathable fibers depends largely on its degree of friability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Friable means that the material can be crumbled with hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure and is therefore likely to emit fibers. The fibrous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluffy sprayed-on materials used for fireproofing, insulation, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sound proofing are considered to be friable, and they readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
release airborne fibers if disturbed. Materials such as vinyl-asbestos floor tile or roofing felt are considered
non-friable if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intact and generally do not emit airborne fibers unless subjected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to sanding, sawing and other aggressive operations. Asbestos-cement pipe or sheet can emit airborne fibers if the
materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are cut or sawed, or if they are broken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Permissible exposure: Exposure to airborne asbestos fibers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not exceed 0.1 fibers per cubic centimeter of air (0.1 f/cc) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
averaged over the 8-hour workday, and 1 fiber per cubic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
centimeter of air (1.0 f/cc) averaged over a 30 minute work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=4 -->
II. Health Hazard Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
A. Asbestos can cause disabling respiratory disease and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various types of cancers if the fibers are inhaled. Inhaling or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingesting fibers from contaminated clothing or skin can also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in these diseases. The symptoms of these diseases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally do not appear for 20 or more years after initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
B. Exposure to asbestos has been shown to cause lung cancer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mesothelioma, and cancer of the stomach and colon. Mesothelioma 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a rare cancer of the thin membrane lining of the chest and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abdomen. Symptoms of mesothelioma include shortness of breath, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pain in the walls of the chest, and/or abdominal pain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=4 -->
III. Respirators and Protective Clothing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
A. Respirators: You are required to wear a respirator when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing tasks that result in asbestos exposure that exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 f/cc and when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing certain designated operations. Air-purifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirators equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HEPA) filter can be used where airborne asbestos fiber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations do not exceed 1.0 f/cc; otherwise, more protective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirators such as air-supplied, positive-pressure, full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facepiece respirators must be used. Disposable respirators or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dust masks are not permitted to be used for asbestos work. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective protection, respirators must fit your face and head 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
snugly. Your employer is required to conduct fit test when you 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are first assigned a respirator and every 6 months thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respirators should not be loosened or removed in work situations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where their use is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Protective Clothing: You are required to wear protective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clothing in work areas where asbestos fiber concentrations exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 f/cc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=4 -->
IV. Disposal Procedures and Clean-up 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
A. Wastes that are generated by processes where asbestos is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Empty asbestos shipping containers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Process wastes such as cuttings, trimmings, or reject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Housekeeping waste from wet-sweeping or HEPA-vacuuming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Asbestos fireproofing or insulating material that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed from buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Asbestos-containing building products removed during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building renovation or demolition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Contaminated disposable protective clothing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Empty shipping bags can be flattened under exhaust hoods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and packed into airtight containers for disposal. Empty shipping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drums are difficult to clean and should be sealed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Vacuum bags or disposable paper filters should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaned, but should be sprayed with a fine water mist and placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into a labeled waste container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Process waste and housekeeping waste should be wetted with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water or a mixture of water and surfactant prior to packaging in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposable containers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Asbestos-containing material that if removed from buildings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be disposed of in leak-tight 6-mil plastic bags, plastic-lined cardboard containers, or plastic-lined metal
containers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These wastes, which are removed while wet, should be sealed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers before they dry out to minimize the release of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos fibers during handling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=4 -->
V. Access to Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
A. Each year, your employer is required to inform you of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information contained in this standard and appendices for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos. In addition, your employer must instruct you in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper work practices for handling asbestos-containing materials, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the correct use of protective equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Your employer is required to determine whether you are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being exposed to asbestos. Your employer must treat exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal system insulation and sprayed-on and trowled-on surfacing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material as asbestos exposure, unless results of laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis show that the material does not contain asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You or your representative has the right to observe employee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements and to record the results obtained. Your employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is required to inform you of your exposure, and, if you are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed above the permissible exposure limit, he or she is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to inform you of the actions that are being taken to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce your exposure to within the permissible limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Your employer is required to keep records of your exposures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and medical examinations. These exposure records must be kept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for at least thirty (30) years. Medical records must be kept for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of your employment plus thirty (30) years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Your employer is required to release your exposure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical records to your physician or designated representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon your written request.

1. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
This method describes the collection and analysis of asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bulk materials by light microscopy techniques including phase- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polar illumination and central-stop dispersion microscopy. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms unique to asbestos analysis are defined below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

long, thin units which have two thin ribbons of double chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
silicate with a brucite ribbon in between. The shape of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit is similar to an ``I beam''. Minerals important in asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis include cummingtonite-grunerite, crocidolite, tremolite-actinolite and anthophyllite.

light scattered by small particles to destructively interfere 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with unscattered light, thereby enhancing the visibility of very

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.1. History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Light microscopy has been used for well over 100 years for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of mineral species. This analysis is carried out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using specialized polarizing microscopes as well as bright field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopes. The identification of minerals is an on-going 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process with many new minerals described each year. The first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recorded use of asbestos was in Finland about 2500 B.C. where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material was used in the mud wattle for the wooden huts the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people lived in as well as strengthening for pottery. Adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health aspects of the mineral were noted nearly 2000 years ago 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when Pliny the Younger wrote about the poor health of slaves in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the asbestos mines. Although known to be injurious for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
centuries, the first modern references to its toxicity were by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the British Labor Inspectorate when it banned asbestos dust from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the workplace in 1898. Asbestosis cases were described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
literature after the turn of the century. Cancer was first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspected in the mid 1930's and a causal link to mesothelioma was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made in 1965. Because of the public concern for worker and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public safety with the use of this material, several different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of analysis were applied to the determination of asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content. Light microscopy requires a great deal of experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and craft. Attempts were made to apply less subjective methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the analysis. X-ray diffraction was partially successful in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the mineral types but was unable to separate out the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibrous portions from the non-fibrous portions. Also, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum detection limit for asbestos analysis by X-ray 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diffraction (XRD) is about 1%. Differential Thermal Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(DTA) was no more successful. These provide useful corroborating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information when the presence of asbestos has been shown by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopy; however, neither can determine the difference between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibrous and non-fibrous minerals when both habits are present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same is true of Infrared Absorption (IR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When electron microscopy was applied to asbestos analysis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundreds of fibers were discovered present too small to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visible in any light microscope. There are two different types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of electron microscope used for asbestos analysis: Scanning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electron Microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(TEM). Scanning Electron Microscopy is useful in identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minerals. The SEM can provide two of the three pieces of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information required to identify fibers by electron microscopy: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
morphology and chemistry. The third is structure as determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by Selected Area Electron Diffraction_SAED which is performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the TEM. Although the resolution of the SEM is sufficient for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very fine fibers to be seen, accuracy of chemical analysis that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be performed on the fibers varies with fiber diameter in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers of less than 0.2 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m diameter. The TEM is a powerful tool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to identify fibers too small to be resolved by light microscopy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and should be used in conjunction with this method when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. The TEM can provide all three pieces of information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required for fiber identification. Most fibers thicker than 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can adequately be defined in the light microscope. The light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscope remains as the best instrument for the determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of mineral type. This is because the minerals under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation were first described analytically with the light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscope. It is inexpensive and gives positive identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for most samples analyzed. Further, when optical techniques are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadequate, there is ample indication that alternative techniques 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be used for complete identification of the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.2. Principle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Minerals consist of atoms that may be arranged in random order or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a regular arrangement. Amorphous materials have atoms in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
random order while crystalline materials have long range order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many materials are transparent to light, at least for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particles or for thin sections. The properties of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials can be investigated by the effect that the material has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on light passing through it. The six asbestos minerals are all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crystalline with particular properties that have been identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and cataloged. These six minerals are anisotropic. They have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular array of atoms, but the arrangement is not the same in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all directions. Each major direction of the crystal presents a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different regularity. Light photons travelling in each of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
main directions will encounter different electrical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neighborhoods, affecting the path and time of travel. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques outlined in this method use the fact that light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traveling through fibers or crystals in different directions will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behave differently, but predictably. The behavior of the light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as it travels through a crystal can be measured and compared with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known or determined values to identify the mineral species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Usually, Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM) is performed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strain-free objectives on a bright-field microscope platform. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This would limit the resolution of the microscope to about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.4 &mu;m. Because OSHA requires the counting and identification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers visible in phase contrast, the phase contrast platform is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to visualize the fibers with the polarizing elements added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the light path. Polarized light methods cannot identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers finer than about 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
m in diameter even though they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visible. The finest fibers are usually identified by inference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the presence of larger, identifiable fiber bundles. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers are present, but not identifiable by light microscopy, use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either SEM or TEM to determine the fiber identity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.3. Advantages and Disadvantages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The advantages of light microcopy are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Basic identification of the materials was first performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 by light microscopy and gross analysis. This provides a

 large base of published information against which to check

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The analysis is specific to fibers. The minerals present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 can exist in asbestiform, fibrous, prismatic, or massive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 varieties all at the same time. Therefore, bulk methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of analysis such as X-ray diffraction, IR analysis, DTA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 etc. are inappropriate where the material is not known to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 be fibrous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The analysis is quick, requires little preparation time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 and can be performed on-site if a suitably equipped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 microscope is available.

(a) Even using phase-polar illumination, not all the fibers present may be seen. This is a problem for very low asbestos
concentrations where agglomerations or large bundles of fibers may not be present to allow identification by inference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The method requires a great degree of sophistication on the part of the microscopist. An analyst is only as useful
as his mental catalog of images. Therefore, a microscopist's accuracy is enhanced by experience. The mineralogical
training of the analyst is very important. It is the basis on which subjective decisions are made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The method uses only a tiny amount of material for analysis. This may lead to sampling bias and false results (high
or low). This is especially true if the sample is severely inhomogeneous.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Fibers may be bound in a matrix and not distinguishable as fibers so identification cannot be made.

1.4. Method Performance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
1.4.1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 This method can be used for determination of asbestos content from 0 to 100% asbestos. The detection limit has not been
adequately determined, although for selected samples, the limit is very low, depending on the number of particles
examined. For mostly homogeneous, finely divided samples, with no difficult fibrous interferences, the detection
limit is below 1%. For inhomogeneous samples (most samples), the detection limit remains undefined. NIST has conducted
proficiency testing of laboratories on a national scale. Although each round is reported statistically with an average,
control limits, etc., the results indicate a difficulty in establishing precision especially in the low concentration
range. It is suspected that there is significant bias in the low range especially near 1%. EPA tried to remedy this by
requiring a mandatory point counting scheme for samples less than 10%. The point counting procedure is tedious, and
may introduce significant biases of its own. It has not been incorporated into this method.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
1.4.2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The precision and accuracy of the quantitation tests performed in this method are unknown. Concentrations are easier
to determine in commercial products where asbestos was deliberately added because the amount is usually more than
a few percent. An analyst's results can be ``calibrated'' against the known amounts added by the manufacturer. For
geological samples, the degree of homogeneity affects the precision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
1.4.3.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The performance of the method is analyst dependent. The analyst must choose carefully and not necessarily randomly
the portions for analysis to assure that detection of asbestos occurs when it is present. For this reason, the analyst
must have adequate training in sample preparation, and experience in the location and identification of asbestos
in samples. This is usually accomplished through substantial on-the-job training as well as formal education in
mineralogy and microscopy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1.5. Interferences
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any material which is long, thin, and small enough to be viewed under the microscope can be considered an interference
for asbestos. There are literally hundreds of interferences in workplaces. The techniques described in this method
are normally sufficient to eliminate the interferences. An analyst's success in eliminating the interferences
depends on proper training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos minerals belong to two mineral families: the serpentines and the amphiboles. In the serpentine family,
the only common fibrous mineral is chrysotile. Occasionally, the mineral antigorite occurs in a fibril habit with
morphology similar to the amphiboles. The amphibole minerals consist of a score of different minerals of which only
five are regulated by federal standard: amosite, crocidolite, anthophyllite asbestos, tremolite asbestos and
actinolite asbestos. These are the only amphibole minerals that have been commercially exploited for their fibrous
properties; however, the rest can and do occur occasionally in asbestiform habit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the related mineral interferences, other minerals common in building material may present a problem
for some microscopists: gypsum, anhydrite, brucite, quartz fibers, talc fibers or ribbons, wollastonite, perlite,
attapulgite, etc. Other fibrous materials commonly present in workplaces are: fiberglass, mineral wool, ceramic
wool, refractory ceramic fibers, kevlar, nomex, synthetic fibers, graphite or carbon fibers, cellulose (paper
or wood) fibers, metal fibers, etc.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Matrix embedding material can sometimes be a negative interference. The analyst may not be able to easily extract
the fibers from the matrix in order to use the method. Where possible, remove the matrix before the analysis, taking
careful note of the loss of weight. Some common matrix materials are: vinyl, rubber, tar, paint, plant fiber, cement,
and epoxy. A further negative interference is that the asbestos fibers themselves may be either too small to be seen
in Phase contrast Microscopy (PCM) or of a very low fibrous quality, having the appearance of plant fibers. The analyst's
ability to deal with these materials increases with experience.

1.6. Uses and Occupational Exposure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos is ubiquitous in the environment. More than 40% of the land area of the United States is composed of minerals
which may contain asbestos. Fortunately, the actual formation of great amounts of asbestos is relatively rare. Nonetheless,
there are locations in which environmental exposure can be severe such as in the Serpentine Hills of California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are thousands of uses for asbestos in industry and the home. Asbestos abatement workers are the most current
segment of the population to have occupational exposure to great amounts of asbestos. If the material is undisturbed,
there is no exposure. Exposure occurs when the asbestos-containing material is abraded or otherwise disturbed during
maintenance operations or some other activity. Approximately 95% of the asbestos in place in the United States is
chrysotile.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amosite and crocidolite make up nearly all the difference. Tremolite and anthophyllite make up a very small percentage.
Tremolite is found in extremely small amounts in certain chrysotile deposits. Actinolite exposure is probably greatest
from environmental sources, but has been identified in vermiculite containing, sprayed-on insulating materials
which may have been certified as asbestos-free.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1.7. Physical and Chemical Properties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The nominal chemical compositions for the asbestos minerals were given in Section 1. Compared to cleavage fragments
of the same minerals, asbestiform fibers possess a high tensile strength along the fiber axis. They are chemically
inert, non-combustible, and heat resistant. Except for chrysotile, they are insoluble in Hydrochloric acid (HCl).
Chrysotile is slightly soluble in HCl. Asbestos has high electrical resistance and good sound absorbing characteristics.
It can be woven into cables, fabrics or other textiles, or matted into papers, felts, and mats.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Possible physiologic results of respiratory exposure to asbestos are mesothelioma of the pleura or peritoneum,
interstitial fibrosis, asbestosis, pneumoconiosis, or respiratory cancer. The possible consequences of asbestos
exposure are detailed in the NIOSH Criteria Document or in the OSHA Asbestos Standards 29 CFR 1910.1001 and 29 CFR 1926.1101.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2.1. Equipment for sampling
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Tube or cork borer sampling device
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Knife
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 20 mL scintillation vial or similar vial
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Sealing encapsulant
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2.2. Safety Precautions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Asbestos is a known carcinogen. Take care when sampling. While in an asbestos-containing atmosphere, a properly
selected and fit-tested respirator should be worn. Take samples in a manner to cause the least amount of dust. Follow
these general guidelines:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Do not make unnecessary dust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Take only a small amount (1 to 2 g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Tightly close the sample container.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Use encapsulant to seal the spot where the sample was taken, if necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Samples of any suspect material should be taken from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconspicuous place. Where the material is to remain, seal the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling wound with an encapsulant to eliminate the potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure from the sample site. Microscopy requires only a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milligrams of material. The amount that will fill a 20 mL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scintillation vial is more than adequate. Be sure to collect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples from all layers and phases of material. If possible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make separate samples of each different phase of the material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This will aid in determining the actual hazard. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
DO NOT USE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ENVELOPES, PLASTIC OR PAPER BAGS OF ANY KIND TO COLLECT SAMPLES. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of plastic bags presents a contamination hazard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory personnel and to other samples. When these containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are opened, a bellows effect blows fibers out of the container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
onto everything, including the person opening the container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a cork-borer type sampler is available, push the tube 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the material all the way, so that all layers of material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are sampled. Some samplers are intended to be disposable. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be capped and sent to the laboratory. If a non-disposable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cork borer is used, empty the contents into a scintillation vial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and send to the laboratory. Vigorously and completely clean the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cork borer between samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2.4&blank;Shipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Samples packed in glass vials must not touch or they might break 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in shipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Seal the samples with a sample seal (such as the OSHA 21) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 over the end to guard against tampering and to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the sample. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Package the bulk samples in separate packages from the air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 samples. They may cross-contaminate each other and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 invalidate the results of the air samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Include identifying paperwork 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
the samples, but not in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 contact with the suspected asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) To maintain sample accountability, ship the samples by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 certified mail, overnight express, or hand carry them to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the laboratory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis of asbestos samples can be divided into two major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts: sample preparation and microscopy. Because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different asbestos uses that may be encountered by the analyst, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each sample may need different preparation steps. The choices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are outlined below. There are several different tests that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed to identify the asbestos species and determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage. They will be explained below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
3.1. Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Do not create unnecessary dust. Handle the samples in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 HEPA-filter equipped hoods. If samples are received in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 bags, envelopes or other inappropriate container, open 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 them only in a hood having a face velocity at or greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 than 100 fpm. Transfer a small amount to a scintillation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 vial and only handle the smaller amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Open samples in a hood, never in the open lab area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Index of refraction oils can be toxic. Take care not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 get this material on the skin. Wash immediately with soap 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 and water if this happens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Samples that have been heated in the muffle furnace or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 drying oven may be hot. Handle them with tongs until they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 are cool enough to handle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Some of the solvents used, such as THF (tetrahydrofuran), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 are toxic and should only be handled in an appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 fume hood and according to instructions given in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).

3.3. Sample Pre-Preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Sample preparation begins with pre-preparation which may include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical reduction of the matrix, heating the sample to dryness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or heating in the muffle furnace. The end result is a sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which has been reduced to a powder that is sufficiently fine to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fit under the cover slip. Analyze different phases of samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately, e.g., tile and the tile mastic should be analyzed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately as the mastic may contain asbestos while the tile may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not.

dispersion colors and must be dried prior to sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mounting. Remove the lid of the scintillation vial, place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bottle in the drying oven and heat at 100
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C to dryness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(usually about 2 h). Samples which are not submitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lab in glass must be removed and placed in glass vials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or aluminum weighing pans before placing them in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drying oven.

(b) Samples With Organic Interference_Muffle Furnace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
These may include samples with tar as a matrix, vinyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos tile, or any other organic that can be reduced by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating. Remove the sample from the vial and weigh in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance to determine the weight of the submitted portion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Place the sample in a muffle furnace at 500
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C for 1 to 2 h 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or until all obvious organic material has been removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Retrieve, cool and weigh again to determine the weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss on ignition. This is necessary to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos content of the submitted sample, because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyst will be looking at a reduced sample.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Note:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Heating above 600
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C will cause the sample to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undergo a structural change which, given sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, will convert the chrysotile to forsterite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heating even at lower temperatures for 1 to 2 h may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a measurable effect on the optical properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the minerals. If the analyst is unsure of what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to expect, a sample of standard asbestos should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heated to the same temperature for the same length 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of time so that it can be examined for the proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation.

Samples With Organic Interference_THF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Vinyl asbestos tile is the most common material treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this solvent, although, substances containing tar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will sometimes yield to this treatment. Select a portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the material and then grind it up if possible. Weigh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sample and place it in a test tube. Add sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
THF to dissolve the organic matrix. This is usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 4 to 5 mL. Remember, THF is highly flammable. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Filter the remaining material through a tared silver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
membrane, dry and weigh to determine how much is left 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the solvent extraction. Further process the sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to remove carbonate or mount directly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Samples With Carbonate Interference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Carbonate material is often found on fibers and sometimes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be removed in order to perform dispersion microscopy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Weigh out a portion of the material and place it in a test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tube. Add a sufficient amount of 0.1 M HCl or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decalcifying solution in the tube to react all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbonate as evidenced by gas formation; i.e., when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas bubbles stop, add a little more solution. If no more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gas forms, the reaction is complete. Filter the material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out through a tared silver membrane, dry and weigh to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the weight lost.

3.4. Sample Preparation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Samples must be prepared so that accurate determination can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made of the asbestos type and amount present. The following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps are carried out in the low-flow hood (a low-flow hood has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than 50 fpm flow):

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) If the sample has large lumps, is hard, or cannot be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 to lie under a cover slip, the grain size must be reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Place a small amount between two slides and grind the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 material between them or grind a small amount in a clean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 mortar and pestle. The choice of whether to use an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 alumina, ruby, or diamond mortar depends on the hardness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of the material. Impact damage can alter the asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 mineral if too much mechanical shock occurs. (Freezer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 mills can completely destroy the observable crystallinity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of asbestos and should not be used). For some samples, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 portion of material can be shaved off with a scalpel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ground off with a hand grinder or hack saw blade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preparation tools should either be disposable or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 cleaned thoroughly. Use vigorous scrubbing to loosen the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 fibers during the washing. Rinse the implements with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 copious amounts of water and air-dry in a dust-free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the sample is powder or has been reduced as in (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 above, it is ready to mount. Place a glass slide on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 piece of optical tissue and write the identification on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the painted or frosted end. Place two drops of index of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 refraction medium n=1.550 on the slide. (The medium n=1.550 is chosen because it is the matching index for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 chrysotile. Dip the end of a clean paper-clip or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 dissecting needle into the droplet of refraction medium on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the slide 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
to moisten it. Then dip the probe into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 powder sample. Transfer what sticks on the probe to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 slide. The material on the end of the probe should have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 diameter of about 3 mm for a good mount. If the material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 is very fine, less sample may be appropriate. For non-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
powder samples such as fiber mats, forceps should be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 to transfer a small amount of material to the slide. Stir 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the material in the medium on the slide, spreading it out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 and making the preparation as uniform as possible. Place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 a cover-slip on the preparation by gently lowering onto 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the slide and allowing it to fall ``trapdoor'' fashion on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the preparation to push out any bubbles. Press gently on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the cover slip to even out the distribution of particulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 on the slide. If there is insufficient mounting oil on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the slide, one or two drops may be placed near the edge of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the coverslip on the slide. Capillary action will draw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the necessary amount of liquid into the preparation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Remove excess oil with the point of a laboratory wiper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treat at least two different areas of each phase in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fashion. Choose representative areas of the sample. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be useful to select particular areas or fibers for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. This is useful to identify asbestos in severely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhomogeneous samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When it is determined that amphiboles may be present, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeat the above process using the appropriate high-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispersion oils until an identification is made or all six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos minerals have been ruled out. Note that percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination must be done in the index medium 1.550 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because amphiboles tend to disappear in their matching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mediums.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis consists of three parts: The determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether there is asbestos present, what type is present and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of how much is present. The general flow of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Gross examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Examination under polarized light on the stereo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Examination by phase-polar illumination on the compound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase microscope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Determination of species by dispersion stain. Examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by Becke line analysis may also be used; however, this is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually more cumbersome for asbestos determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Difficult samples may need to be analyzed by SEM or TEM, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the results from those techniques combined with light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopy for a definitive identification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Identification of a particle as asbestos requires that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be asbestiform. Description of particles should follow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the suggestion of Campbell. (Figure 1)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purpose of regulation, the mineral must be one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six minerals covered and must be in the asbestos growth habit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large specimen samples of asbestos generally have the gross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appearance of wood. Fibers are easily parted from it. Asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers are very long compared with their widths. The fibers have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a very high tensile strength as demonstrated by bending without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breaking. Asbestos fibers exist in bundles that are easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parted, show longitudinal fine structure and may be tufted at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ends showing ``bundle of sticks'' morphology. In the microscope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some of these properties may not be observable. Amphiboles do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not always show striations along their length even when they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asbestos. Neither will they always show tufting. They generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not show a curved nature except for very long fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos and asbestiform minerals are usually characterized in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups by extremely high aspect ratios (greater than 100:1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While aspect ratio analysis is useful for characterizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations of fibers, it cannot be used to identify individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers of intermediate to short aspect ratio. Observation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many fibers is often necessary to determine whether a sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consists of ``cleavage fragments'' or of asbestos fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most cleavage fragments of the asbestos minerals are easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguishable from true asbestos fibers. This is because true 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleavage fragments usually have larger diameters than 1 &mu;m. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal structure of particles larger than this usually shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them to have no internal fibrillar structure. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleavage fragments of the monoclinic amphiboles show inclined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extinction under crossed polars with no compensator. Asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers usually show extinction at zero degrees or ambiguous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extinction if any at all. Morphologically, the larger cleavage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fragments are obvious by their blunt or stepped ends showing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prismatic habit. Also, they tend to be acicular rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filiform. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the particles are less than 1 &mu;m in diameter and have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspect ratio greater than or equal to 3:1, it is recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sample be analyzed by SEM or TEM if there is any question 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the fibers are cleavage fragments or asbestiform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Care must be taken when analyzing by electron microscopy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the interferences are different from those in light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopy and may structurally be very similar to asbestos. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classic interference is between anthophyllite and biopyribole or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediate fiber. Use the same morphological clues for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electron microscopy as are used for light microscopy, e.g. fibril 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splitting, internal longitudinal striation, fraying, curvature, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Gross examination: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examine the sample, preferably in the glass vial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determine the presence of any obvious fibrous component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimate a percentage based on previous experience and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current observation. Determine whether any pre-preparation is necessary. Determine the number of phases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present. This step may be carried out or augmented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observation at 6 to 40&times; under a stereo microscope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) After performing any necessary pre-preparation, prepare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slides of each phase as described above. Two preparations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the same phase in the same index medium can be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
side-by-side on the same glass for convenience. Examine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the polarizing stereo microscope. Estimate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of asbestos based on the amount of birefringent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Examine the slides on the phase-polar microscopes at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnifications of 160 and 400&times;. Note the morphology of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fibers. Long, thin, very straight fibers with little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
curvature are indicative of fibers from the amphibole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family. Curved, wavy fibers are usually indicative of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chrysotile. Estimate the percentage of asbestos on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase-polar microscope under conditions of crossed polars 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a gypsum plate. Fibers smaller than 1.0 &mu;m in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thickness must be identified by inference to the presence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of larger, identifiable fibers and morphology. If no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larger fibers are visible, electron microscopy should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed. At this point, only a tentative identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be made. Full identification must be made with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispersion microscopy. Details of the tests are included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the appendices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Once fibers have been determined to be present, they must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be identified. Adjust the microscope for dispersion mode 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and observe the fibers. The microscope has a rotating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stage, one polarizing element, and a system for generating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dark-field dispersion microscopy (see Section 4.6. of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix). Align a fiber with its length parallel to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polarizer and note the color of the Becke lines. Rotate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stage to bring the fiber length perpendicular to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polarizer and note the color. Repeat this process for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every fiber or fiber bundle examined. The colors must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the colors generated by standard asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference materials for a positive identification. In n=1.550, amphiboles will generally show a yellow to straw-yellow
color indicating that the fiber indices of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refraction are higher than the liquid. If long, thin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers are noted and the colors are yellow, prepare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further slides as above in the suggested matching liquids

interferences in the other liquid; e.g., wollastonite in n=1.620 will give the same colors as tremolite. In n=1.605
wollastonite will appear yellow in all directions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wollastonite may be determined under crossed polars as it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will change from blue to yellow as it is rotated along its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiber axis by tapping on the cover slip. Asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minerals will not change in this way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determination of the angle of extinction may, when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present, aid in the determination of anthophyllite from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tremolite. True asbestos fibers usually have 0
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extinction or ambiguous extinction, while cleavage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fragments have more definite extinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continue analysis until both preparations have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined and all present species of asbestos are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified. If there are no fibers present, or there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than 0.1% present, end the analysis with the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of slides (2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Some fibers have a coating on them which makes dispersion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopy very difficult or impossible. Becke line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis or electron microscopy may be performed in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases. Determine the percentage by light microscopy. TEM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis tends to overestimate the actual percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Percentage determination is an estimate of occluded area, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tempered by gross observation. Gross observation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is used to make sure that the high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnification microscopy does not greatly over- or under- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate the amount of fiber present. This part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis requires a great deal of experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Satisfactory models for asbestos content analysis have not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yet been developed, although some models based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metallurgical grain-size determination have found some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility. Estimation is more easily handled in situations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the grain sizes visible at about 160&times; are about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same and the sample is relatively homogeneous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
View all of the area under the cover slip to make the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage determination. View the fields while moving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stage, paying attention to the clumps of material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These are not usually the best areas to perform dispersion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscopy because of the interference from other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials. But, they are the areas most likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent the accurate percentage in the sample. Small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts of asbestos require slower scanning and more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequent analysis of individual fields. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report the area occluded by asbestos as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration. This estimate does not generally take into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration the difference in density of the different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species present in the sample. For most samples this is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate. Simulation studies with similar materials must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be carried out to apply microvisual estimation for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose and is beyond the scope of this procedure.

The percentage determined by microscopy is multiplied by

Auxiliary Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the subjective nature of asbestos analysis, certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concepts and procedures need to be discussed in more depth. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information will help the analyst understand why some of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures are carried out the way they are. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
4.1. Light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Light is electromagnetic energy. It travels from its source in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packets called quanta. It is instructive to consider light as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plane wave. The light has a direction of travel. Perpendicular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this and mutually perpendicular to each other, are two vector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components. One is the magnetic vector and the other is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric vector. We shall only be concerned with the electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vector. In this description, the interaction of the vector and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mineral will describe all the observable phenomena. From a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light source such a microscope illuminator, light travels in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different direction from the filament. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any given direction away from the filament, the electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vector is perpendicular to the direction of travel of a light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ray. While perpendicular, its orientation is random about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
travel axis. If the electric vectors from all the light rays were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lined up by passing the light through a filter that would only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
let light rays with electric vectors oriented in one direction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass, the light would then be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
POLARIZED
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Polarized light interacts with matter in the direction of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electric vector. This is the polarization direction. Using this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property it is possible to use polarized light to probe different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials and identify them by how they interact with light. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant at about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.99&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 m/s. When light travels in different materials such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as air, water, minerals or oil, it does not travel at this speed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It travels slower. This slowing is a function of both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material through which the light is traveling and the wavelength 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or frequency of the light. In general, the more dense the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material, the slower the light travels. Also, generally, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher the frequency, the slower the light will travel. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to that in a material is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
called the index of refraction (n). It is usually measured at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
589 nm (the sodium D line). If white light (light containing all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the visible wavelengths) travels through a material, rays of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer wavelengths will travel faster than those of shorter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wavelengths, this separation is called dispersion. Dispersion is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used as an identifier of materials as described in Section 4.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
4.2. Material Properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Materials are either amorphous or crystalline. The difference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between these two descriptions depends on the positions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atoms in them. The atoms in amorphous materials are randomly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arranged with no long range order. An example of an amorphous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material is glass. The atoms in crystalline materials, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other hand, are in regular arrays and have long range order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the atoms can be found in highly predictable locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of crystalline material are salt, gold, and the asbestos 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minerals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is beyond the scope of this method to describe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different types of crystalline materials that can be found, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the full description of the classes into which they can fall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, some general crystallography is provided below to give a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foundation to the procedures described. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the exception of anthophyllite, all the asbestos minerals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
belong to the monoclinic crystal type. The unit cell is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basic repeating unit of the crystal and for monoclinic crystals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be described as having three unequal sides, two 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; angles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and one angle not equal to 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;. The orthorhombic group, of which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anthophyllite is a member has three unequal sides and three 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
angles. The unequal sides are a consequence of the complexity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fitting the different atoms into the unit cell. Although the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atoms are in a regular array, that array is not symmetrical in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all directions. There is long range order in the three major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directions of the crystal. However, the order is different in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the three directions. This has the effect that the index 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of refraction is different in each of the three directions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using polarized light, we can investigate the index of refraction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in each of the directions and identify the mineral or material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under investigation. The indices 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

,

, and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 are used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify the lowest, middle, and highest index of refraction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively. The x direction, associated with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 is called the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fast axis. Conversely, the z direction is associated with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the slow direction. Crocidolite has 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 along the fiber length 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making it ``length-fast''. The remainder of the asbestos minerals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 axis along the fiber length. They are called ``length-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slow''. This orientation to fiber length is used to aid in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of asbestos.

4.3. Polarized Light Technique 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Polarized light microscopy as described in this section uses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase-polar microscope described in Section 3.2. A phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrast microscope is fitted with two polarizing elements, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below and one above the sample. The polarizers have their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polarization directions at right angles to each other. Depending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the tests performed, there may be a compensator between these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two polarizing elements. A compensator is a piece of mineral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with known properties that ``compensates'' for some deficiency in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the optical train. Light emerging from a polarizing element has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its electric vector pointing in the polarization direction of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
element. The light will not be subsequently transmitted through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a second element set at a right angle to the first element. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless the light is altered as it passes from one element to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other, there is no transmission of light.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Crystals which have different crystal regularity in two or three main directions are said to be anisotropic. They
have a different index of refraction in each of the main directions. When such a crystal is inserted between the crossed
polars, the field of view is no longer dark but shows the crystal in color. The color depends on the properties of the
crystal. The light acts as if it travels through the crystal along the optical axes. If a crystal optical axis were lined
up along one of the polarizing directions (either the polarizer or the analyzer) the light would appear to travel only
in that direction, and it would blink out or go dark. The difference in degrees between the fiber direction and the angle
at which it blinks out is called the angle of extinction. When this angle can be measured, it is useful in identifying
the mineral. The procedure for measuring the angle of extinction is to first identify the polarization direction
in the microscope. A commercial alignment slide can be used to establish the polarization directions or use anthophyllite
or another suitable mineral. This mineral has a zero degree angle of extinction and will go dark to extinction as it
aligns with the polarization directions. When a fiber of anthophyllite has gone to extinction, align the eyepiece
reticle or graticule with the fiber so that there is a visual cue as to the direction of polarization in the field of view.
Tape or otherwise secure the eyepiece in this position so it will not shift. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the polarization direction has been identified in the field of view, move the particle of interest to the center
of the field of view and align it with the polarization direction. For fibers, align the fiber along this direction.
Note the angular reading of the rotating stage. Looking at the particle, rotate the stage until the fiber goes dark
or ``blinks out''. Again note the reading of the stage. The difference in the first reading and the second is an angle
of extinction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The angle measured may vary as the orientation of the fiber changes about its long axis. Tables of mineralogical data
usually report the maximum angle of extinction. Asbestos forming minerals, when they exhibit an angle of extinction,
usually do show an angle of extinction close to the reported maximum, or as appropriate depending on the substitution
chemistry.

4.5. Crossed Polars with Compensator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When the optical axes of a crystal are not lined up along one of the polarizing directions (either the polarizer or the
analyzer) part of the light travels along one axis and part travels along the other visible axis. This is characteristic
of birefringent materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The color depends on the difference of the two visible indices of refraction and the thickness of the crystal. The maximum
difference available is the difference between the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 -->
g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 axes. This maximum difference is usually tabulated as the birefringence of the crystal.

For this test, align the fiber at 45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to the polarization directions in order to maximize the contribution to each of the optical axes. The colors
seen are called retardation colors. They arise from the recombination of light which has traveled through the two
separate directions of the crystal. One of the rays is retarded behind the other since the light in that direction travels
slower. On recombination, some of the colors which make up white light are enhanced by constructive interference
and some are suppressed by destructive interference. The result is a color dependent on the difference between the
indices and the thickness of the crystal. The proper colors, thicknesses, and retardations are shown on a Michel-Levy
chart. The three items, retardation, thickness and birefringence are related by the following relationship:

Examination of the equation for asbestos minerals reveals that the visible colors for almost all common asbestos
minerals and fiber sizes are shades of gray and black. The eye is relatively poor at discriminating different shades
of gray. It is very good at discriminating different colors. In order to compensate for the low retardation, a compensator
is added to the light train between the polarization elements. The compensator used for this test is a gypsum plate
of known thickness and birefringence. Such a compensator when oriented at 45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to the polarizer direction, provides a retardation of 530 nm of the 530 nm wavelength color. This enhances the
red color and gives the background a characteristic red to red-magenta color. If this ``full-wave'' compensator
is in place when the asbestos preparation is inserted into the light train, the colors seen on the fibers are quite different.
Gypsum, like asbestos has a fast axis and a slow axis. When a fiber is aligned with its fast axis in the same direction
as the fast axis of the gypsum plate, the ray vibrating in the slow direction is retarded by both the asbestos and the
gypsum. This results in a higher retardation than would be present for either of the two minerals. The color seen is
a second order blue. When the fiber is rotated 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; using the rotating stage, the slow direction of the fiber is now aligned with the fast direction of the gypsum
and the fast direction of the fiber is aligned with the slow direction of the gypsum. Thus, one ray vibrates faster in
the fast direction of the gypsum, and slower in the slow direction of the fiber; the other ray will vibrate slower in
the slow direction of the gypsum and faster in the fast direction of the fiber. In this case, the effect is subtractive
and the color seen is a first order yellow. As long as the fiber thickness does not add appreciably to the color, the same
basic colors will be seen for all asbestos types except crocidolite. In crocidolite the colors will be weaker, may
be in the opposite directions, and will be altered by the blue absorption color natural to crocidolite. Hundreds of
other materials will give the same colors as asbestos, and therefore, this test is not definitive for asbestos. The
test is useful in discriminating against fiberglass or other amorphous fibers such as some synthetic fibers. Certain
synthetic fibers will show retardation colors different than asbestos; however, there are some forms of polyethylene
and aramid which will show morphology and retardation colors similar to asbestos minerals. This test must be supplemented
with a positive identification test when birefringent fibers are present which can not be excluded by morphology.
This test is relatively ineffective for use on fibers less than 1

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Dispersion microscopy or dispersion staining is the method of choice for the identification of asbestos in bulk materials.
Becke line analysis is used by some laboratories and yields the same results as does dispersion staining for asbestos
and can be used in lieu of dispersion staining. Dispersion staining is performed on the same platform as the phase-polar
analysis with the analyzer and compensator removed. One polarizing element remains to define the direction of the
light so that the different indices of refraction of the fibers may be separately determined. Dispersion microscopy
is a dark-field technique when used for asbestos. Particles are imaged with scattered light. Light which is unscattered
is blocked from reaching the eye either by the back field image mask in a McCrone objective or a back field image mask
in the phase condenser. The most convenient method is to use the rotating phase condenser to move an oversized phase
ring into place. The ideal size for this ring is for the central disk to be just larger than the objective entry aperture
as viewed in the back focal plane. The larger the disk, the less scattered light reaches the eye. This will have the effect
of diminishing the intensity of dispersion color and will shift the actual color seen. The colors seen vary even on
microscopes from the same manufacturer. This is due to the different bands of wavelength exclusion by different mask
sizes. The mask may either reside in the condenser or in the objective back focal plane. It is imperative that the analyst
determine by experimentation with asbestos standards what the appropriate colors should be for each asbestos type.
The colors depend also on the temperature of the preparation and the exact chemistry of the asbestos. Therefore, some
slight differences from the standards should be allowed. This is not a serious problem for commercial asbestos uses.
This technique is used for identification of the indices of refraction for fibers by recognition of color. There is
no direct numerical readout of the index of refraction. Correlation of color to actual index of refraction is possible
by referral to published conversion tables. This is not necessary for the analysis of asbestos. Recognition of appropriate
colors along with the proper morphology are deemed sufficient to identify the commercial asbestos minerals. Other
techniques including SEM, TEM, and XRD may be required to provide additional information in order to identify other
types of asbestos.

Make a preparation in the suspected matching high dispersion oil, e.g., n=1.550 for chrysotile. Perform the preliminary
tests to determine whether the fibers are birefringent or not. Take note of the morphological character. Wavy fibers
are indicative of chrysotile while long, straight, thin, frayed fibers are indicative of amphibole asbestos. This
can aid in the selection of the appropriate matching oil. The microscope is set up and the polarization direction is
noted as in Section 4.4. Align a fiber with the polarization direction. Note the color. This is the color parallel to
the polarizer. Then rotate the fiber rotating the stage 90
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; so that the polarization direction is across the fiber. This is the perpendicular position. Again note the color.
Both colors must be consistent with standard asbestos minerals in the correct direction for a positive identification
of asbestos. If only one of the colors is correct while the other is not, the identification is not positive. If the colors
in both directions are bluish-white, the analyst has chosen a matching index oil which is higher than the correct matching
oil, e.g. the analyst has used n=1.620 where chrysotile is present. The next lower oil (Section 3.5.) should be used
to prepare another specimen. If the color in both directions is yellow-white to straw-yellow-white, this indicates
that the index of the oil is lower than the index of the fiber, e.g. the preparation is in n=1.550 while anthophyllite
is present. Select the next higher oil (Section 3.5.) and prepare another slide. Continue in this fashion until a positive
identification of all asbestos species present has been made or all possible asbestos species have been ruled out
by negative results in this test. Certain plant fibers can have similar dispersion colors as asbestos. Take care to
note and evaluate the morphology of the fibers or remove the plant fibers in pre-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation. Coating material on the fibers such as carbonate or vinyl may destroy the dispersion color. Usually,
there will be some outcropping of fiber which will show the colors sufficient for identification. When this is not
the case, treat the sample as described in Section 3.3. and then perform dispersion staining. Some samples will yield
to Becke line analysis if they are coated or electron microscopy can be used for identification.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary amends the regulations governing Part A and Part D, Subpart 1 of Chapter 1 of Title I of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Part A of Chapter 1 provides financial assistance through State educational
agencies (SEAs) to local educational agencies (LEAs) to meet the special educational needs of educationally deprived
children in school attendance areas with high concentrations of children from low-income families and children
in local institutions for neglected or delinquent children. Part D of Chapter 1 authorizes a Migrant Education Program
(MEP) that provides financial assistance to SEAs to establish and improve programs to meet the special educational
needs of migratory children of migratory agricultural workers or fishermen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments afford flexibility to States that have developed assessment systems that support their systemic
education reform efforts but that are inconsistent with the national evaluation standards in Subpart H of 34 CFR Part
200 and Subpart E of 34 CFR Part 201. These regulations contain less prescriptive national standards that enable States
to request an exception to the generally applicable national evaluation standards in order to use their own assessment
systems to evaluate the effectiveness of their Chapter 1 and MEP programs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 10, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 11444&hyph;46), that proposed conditions for granting exceptions to the national evaluation standards in
Subpart H of Part 200 and in Subpart E of Part 201 to enable States that are implementing new assessment systems that
support statewide education reform to use those assessments_under less prescriptive national standards_to measure
the effectiveness of their Chapter 1 and MEP programs. Under the NPRM, the Secretary could have approved a State's
request for an exception to the generally applicable Chapter 1 national evaluation standards if the State had an assessment
system that had been developed to support the State's education reform efforts, the assessment system provided information
about the yearly performance of each Chapter 1 school and could be aggregated for the LEA as a whole, and that information
was from at least one grade level in each school, and measured student achievement in basic and more advanced skills
and challenging subject matter. The same standards were proposed to apply to the MEP, except that the assessment system
would have to provide a statewide estimate of the yearly performance of migratory children in the State, rather than
information on individual schools. The NPRM also proposed to permit States to request exceptions for particular
LEAs and operating agencies that, absent State systems, have local assessment systems in place that support their
education reform efforts and meet these same standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final regulations make the following changes to the NPRM. Most significantly, &sect;&sect;200.90(b) and
201.57(b) have been revised to require that, in addition to the conditions in the NPRM, a State assessment system for
which an exception is being requested (1) must yield consistent results that accurately reflect what the assessment
system was designed to measure; and (2) does not impair an SEA's or LEA's ability to account for results under Chapter
1 or the MEP. The Secretary has added these standards to ensure that State assessment systems being developed to support
systemic education reform efforts are of high quality and that exceptions under these regulations would only be granted
if evaluation results provide meaningful indicators about the effectiveness of Chapter 1 and MEP programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;200.90(b) has been revised to make clear that a State assessment system must provide information
from at least one grade level in each Chapter 1 school. Sections 200.90(c) and 201.57(c) have also been revised to clarify
that an SEA may seek an exception for LEAs or operating agencies that have assessment systems linked to local reform
efforts that meet the same standards that apply to State assessment systems. Finally, &sect;200.80(a) has been revised

These regulations support the efforts of those States that will be voluntarily implementing reform plans under the
Goals 2000: Educate America Act (Goals 2000). Section 306(c) of Goals 2000 requires the reform plans to include a description
of the process States will use to develop State assessments aligned with the State's content standards and that the
assessments be for all students, including students with diverse learning needs. These regulations will allow States
that have assessment systems tied to statewide education reform, developed under Goals 2000 or another reform effort,
to avoid duplication by using their statewide assessments for Chapter 1 and MEP purposes if they meet less prescriptive
national standards contained in these regulations.

In granting an exception, the Secretary will not be waiving any statutory requirements. SEAs and LEAs will continue
to evaluate the effectiveness of their Chapter 1 programs under section 1019, in accordance with less prescriptive
standards contained in these regulations. SEAs and LEAs will also continue to perform the annual review required
under section 1021(a), measure sustained program gains under sections 1019(a)(3) and 1021(a)(2), identify schools
and students in need of program improvement under section 1021(b) and (f), and meet schoolwide project accountability
requirements under section 1015(e), using the State assessment and any other sources of information deemed appropriate.
Similarly, under the MEP, SEAs will still need to ensure that they and their operating agencies adhere to the requirements
of sections 1012(b), 1019(b), and 1202(a)(6) to use desired outcomes for evaluating performance, to collect and
report demographic and performance data, and to examine sustained gains for formerly migratory children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary wishes to emphasize that no State is required to make any changes in its Chapter 1 or MEP testing programs
as a result of these regulations. Rather, the exceptions are intended to provide flexibility to enable States to use
their own assessment systems for Chapter 1 and MEP purposes if they wish to do so.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order,
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential benefits associated with these regulations are clear. Rather than continuing to operate multiple
assessment systems for Federal and State purposes, some States may use their State systems to evaluate their Chapter
1 and MEP programs. Moreover, the potential costs associated with these regulations are negligible. Because the
regulations permit States to use their own assessment systems, States will incur few, if any, additional costs. To
the contrary, these regulations will result in reduced costs for States that might otherwise have had to operate multiple
assessment systems. The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with
State, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions.

These proposed regulations would affect SEAs and LEAs that have developed assessment systems that support their
educational reform efforts but that are inconsistent with the national evaluation standards in Subpart H of Part
200 or Subpart E of Part 201. The Department needs the information to grant exceptions to the national evaluation standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested that the Department used the word ``exception'' in the proposed regulations because the
Department cannot grant waivers. The commenter argued that there is no meaningful distinction between ``exception''
and ``waiver'' and, therefore, the Secretary lacks the authority to grant ``exceptions'' to requirements that evaluations
of Chapter 1 and MEP programs be based on the current national standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is, of course, true that the Secretary cannot waive statutory or regulatory requirements absent specific authority.
As a result, the Secretary is engaging in formal rulemaking to make exceptions to the generally applicable standards
by adopting less prescriptive standards that would apply in the case of States that request authority to use testing
tied to State systemic reform efforts in lieu of separate Chapter 1 evaluations. It is important to recognize that
the Secretary would not be granting exceptions to any statutory requirements. Rather, he would be granting exceptions
to particular regulatory provisions that were initially promulgated and have now been revisited through the appropriate
rulemaking process. By authorizing the Secretary to grant ``exceptions,'' the regulations clarify that the generally
applicable national evaluation standards are still the primary provisions governing Chapter 1 and MEP evaluations.
The Secretary recognizes, however, that some States, as part of their systemic State education reform efforts, have
developed new assessment systems that may be inconsistent with these standards because, for example, they are not
based on national norms or do not test children in every grade. These regulations contain less prescriptive national
standards that permit these States to use their own assessment systems to evaluate the effectiveness of their Chapter
1 and MEP programs, rather than requiring these States to administer separate tests purely for Chapter 1 and MEP purposes.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter asserted that the regulations do not comply with the Chapter 1 statute. According to the commenter,
the Secretary is ``waiving all Chapter 1 testing requirements *&blank;*&blank;* without adopting any substitute
that can equally ensure compliance with the statute.'' In particular, the commenter contended that the regulations
would eliminate the requirement to use ``objective measurements'' of ``individual student achievement,'' thereby
shifting the focus away from individual students. The commenter also argued that the proposed regulations would
undermine the statutory requirement that improved student performance be sustained for more than one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These regulations neither waive nor are inconsistent with any statutory requirements. For example, the basic evaluation
requirement in section 1019(a) of Chapter 1 requires an LEA to evaluate the effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
programs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 assisted under Chapter 1. The LEA must use ``objective measurement of individual student achievement in basic skills
and more advanced skills, aggregated for the LEA as a whole'' as an indicator of the impact of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
program.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the type of State assessment system to which the exception would apply, all of these requirements would have
to be met. The assessments would have to_use objective measures; measure basic and more advanced skills; assess the
achievement of individual children; and be capable of being aggregated for each LEA as a whole. Nothing in section
1019(a), however, requires these assessment systems to assess each child served in Chapter 1 or to be based on national
norms; rather, the Secretary imposed these requirements through the current national standards. Moreover, contrary
to the commenter's interpretation, the requirement in section 1019(a)(3) regarding ``sustained gains'' relates
to improved performance of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
program
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 over a period of more than one year, not to individual student performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the preamble indicates, under these final regulations SEAs and LEAs must continue to meet all statutory assessment
requirements. In particular, SEAs and LEAs must still evaluate the effectiveness of their Chapter 1 programs under
section 1019, perform the annual review required under section 1021(a), measure sustained program gains under sections
1019(a)(3) and 1021(a)(2), identify schools and students in need of program improvement under section 1021 (b) and
(f), and meet schoolwide project accountability requirements under section 1015(e). Similarly, under the MEP,
SEAs must ensure that they and their operating agencies adhere to the requirements of sections 1012(b), 1019(b),
and 1202(a)(6) to use desired outcomes for evaluating performance, to collect and report demographic and performance
data, and to examine sustained gains for formerly migratory children. If the Secretary grants an exception under
these final regulations, these requirements may be met using the State assessment and any other sources of information
deemed appropriate. Thus, if a State assessment system does not provide sufficient information to meet one or more
of these requirements, the SEA, LEA, or operating agency would have to supplement that system with other appropriate
information.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter asserted that the proposed regulations did not satisfy the Administrative Procedure Act. The commenter
specifically argued that the proposed regulations should contain the criteria on which exceptions would be based
so that commenters could adequately respond.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, the proposed regulations contained adequate notice of the
standards that States would have to meet to be excepted from the generally applicable national evaluation standards.
Those standards were_the assessment system has been developed to support a State's education reform efforts; the
system provides information about the yearly performance of each Chapter 1 school; and the information provided
is from at least one grade level, measures student achievement in basic and more advanced skills and challenging subject
matter, and can be aggregated for the LEA as a whole.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in response to several comments, the Secretary has added two additional standards and one clarification.
The assessment system must yield consistent results that accurately reflect what the assessment system was designed
to measure. The use of the assessment system may not impair an SEA's or LEA's ability to account for results under Chapter
1. The information from the assessment system must be from at least one grade level in each Chapter 1 school. Similar
standards apply to the MEP, except that the system must provide a statewide estimate of the yearly performance of migratory
children in the State, rather than information on individual schools.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Changes:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two additional standards have been added to &sect;&sect;200.90(b) and 201.57(b). The State assessment system must
yield consistent results that accurately reflect what the assessment system was designed to measure, and use of the
system may not impair an SEA's or LEA's ability to account for results under Chapter 1 or the MEP. In addition, &sect;200.90(b)(1)
has been revised to make clear that the assessment system must provide information from at least one grade level in
each Chapter 1 school.

 One commenter contended that the Secretary's explanation for why these regulations are needed was inadequate. In
the commenter's view, the Secretary offered only ``an assortment of unsubstantiated policy-oriented statements
in lieu of hard, objective facts.'' The commenter concluded that the Secretary is trying to change the national evaluation
standards by ``administrative fiat,'' without any explanation of the reasons and supporting evidence for the changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has articulated quite clearly in the preamble to both the proposed and final regulations why he is taking
this action. The national evaluation standards were adopted in 1989 and represented the best thinking at that time
about how to implement the statutory evaluation requirements. They were predicated largely on the perceived need
to use a measure that would provide data that could be aggregated for the Nation_i.e., nationally normed tests or tests
equated with national norms_even though the statute itself does not require aggregation to either the State or national
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since then, two developments of national significance have required a change in those national standards. First,
a number of States have developed new assessment systems, linked to their statewide education reform efforts, to
improve the quality of education in their States. These assessment systems are tied to high State standards for what
children should know and be able to do, but in some instances are inconsistent with the national evaluation standards
because they do not routinely rely on nationally normed tests and typically only assess children in certain grades.
As a result, these States must operate separate assessment systems: ones that they use to make informed decisions
about the effectiveness of education programs in their State; and ones that they use only for Chapter 1 or MEP purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a related matter, major educational reform legislation, the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;227),
became law on March 31, 1994. Section 306(c) of Goals 2000 requires reform plans developed under the statute to include
a description of the process a State will use to develop State assessments aligned with the State's content standards
and that the assessments be for all students, including students with diverse learning needs. These regulations
will allow States that have assessment systems tied to statewide education reform, developed under Goals 2000 or
another effort, to obtain exceptions from existing Chapter 1 and MEP evaluation requirements and, subject to less
prescriptive standards in these regulations, use their statewide assessments for Chapter 1 and MEP purposes. By
allowing those States that already have developed assessment systems tied to statewide education reform efforts
to obtain exceptions from existing Chapter 1 and MEP evaluation requirements, these regulations permit those States
to focus their energies on the new assessments without having to implement a separate assessment system for Chapter
1 and MEP that may not support reform efforts. The Secretary believes that requiring these States to operate separate
assessment systems for Chapter 1 and MEP purposes serves neither the interests of participating children nor the
Federal programs involved.

One commenter contended that these regulations are fundamentally flawed because the ``need'' for the exception
is wholly without merit. Defending nationally normed tests, the commenter disputed that new State assessment systems
would provide more meaningful data and asserted that new and traditional assessment systems are not mutually exclusive.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter may have missed the point of these regulations. The regulations do not require any State to make changes
in its Chapter 1 or MEP testing programs. Even a State that has developed an assessment system to support its education
reform efforts will not be required to use that system to evaluate its Chapter 1 or MEP programs. At the same time, however,
the Secretary does not want the current national evaluation standards to stand in the way of a State's efforts, in reforming
its educational system, to define what all students should be expected to know, train instructional staff to teach
those subjects, and assess whether students, in fact, have learned what they should know. In particular, the Secretary
believes that States that are pursuing this kind of reform, and that have already developed their own measures for
assessing what all children should know, should be free to use those assessments to evaluate their States' Chapter
1 and MEP programs if they are satisfied that these measures provide more meaningful information on the progress of
participating children than does use of the current national standards. The current national evaluation standards
preclude a State from making this choice. To the extent that a State's assessment system does not rely on a nationally
normed test or fails to assess every participating child in grades 2 through 12, it is inconsistent with, and therefore
cannot be used to satisfy, the current national evaluation standards.

One commenter interpreted the Secretary's desire to eliminate dual testing as a determination that multiple measures
are inconsistent with the current Chapter 1 evaluation requirements. The commenter asserted that a rationale for
the proposed exception premised on a single assessment theory is inconsistent with current law.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter may have misinterpreted the Secretary's rationale for proposing an exception to the national evaluation
standards. The Secretary is not requiring use of a sole assessment criterion. Rather, like the commenter, the Secretary
encourages multiple assessment measures and anticipates that most, if not all, State assessment systems qualifying
for an exception would consist of multiple measures. On the other hand, the Secretary is trying to eliminate the need
for a State to administer dual tests, i.e., administering a particular type of test merely to satisfy the Chapter 1
national evaluation standards while administering an acceptable alternative assessment system for the State's
own purposes.

One commenter suggested that, instead of granting exceptions, the Secretary revise the regulations to require the
use of multiple measures, including norm-referenced tests. According to the commenter, although it is appropriate
to use additional assessments that could provide critical evidence of whether children are performing at an appropriate
level, norm-referenced tests should also be used because they meet the technical standards of reliability and validity.

These regulations do not alter the criteria for identifying and selecting children for participation in Chapter
1 or MEP programs. Under Chapter 1, for example, children must still be identified as educationally deprived ``on
the basis of educationally related objective criteria established by the [LEA] which include written or oral testing
instruments.'' This requirement, however, does not mandate a specific type of assessment, particularly one that
uses a nationally normed test. An LEA may use whatever educationally related objective criteria it deems appropriate.
Thus, to the extent the State assessment system meets the LEA's needs, it may also serve to identify and select children
for participation in Chapter 1. On the other hand, to the extent the State assessment system does not provide sufficient
information on specific children, the LEA would need to use additional measures to select children for participation
in Chapter 1 programs.

There is no statutory or regulatory requirement that a State limit its assessment of its Chapter 1 or MEP programs to
a single grade level per school. Indeed, if a State believes that one grade does not adequately represent the progress
of children in Chapter 1 or MEP or the effectiveness of a school, it should assess children in other grades to achieve
an adequate picture of their progress.

 It is true that comparative data on individual children would not be required under an exception just as it is not required
under the statute. However, regardless of whether a State assessment system includes comparative data, nothing
would prevent an LEA from augmenting the State assessment system to obtain comparative data if the LEA believes the
data would be useful.

 Several commenters suggested that the basic technical standards contained in &sect;200.81 of the Chapter 1 regulations
be maintained.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Chapter 1 statute does not mandate that specific technical standards be prescribed. Moreover, exceptions granted
under these regulations would govern a limited period from the present until the reauthorization of Chapter 1 takes
effect. The Secretary does not want to prescribe technical standards for this limited period that may run counter
to standards that may be required under reauthorization. In addition, these regulations come at a time when the testing
community, in general, is grappling with new forms of assessments that better measure what children should know and
be able to do and redefining what technical standards best meet the needs of those assessments. The technical standards
in &sect;200.81 of the current regulations are often construed as prohibiting assessments other than those that
are nationally normed or those that are modeled after these tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is very concerned, however, that State assessment systems being developed to support systemic education
reform efforts are of high quality and useful and that exceptions under these regulations only would be granted where
evaluation results under Chapter 1 and the MEP provide meaningful indicators about the progress under Chapter 1 and
MEP. The Secretary, therefore, is requiring under these regulations the following basic technical standards for
the assessment system: (1) that the system yields consistent results and (2) that those results accurately reflect
what the assessment system was designed to measure. The Secretary has determined that to impose any additional technical
standards on new assessment measures for the Chapter 1 and MEP programs is not necessary to ensure that the results
of evaluations of these programs are sufficiently meaningful and useful. The Secretary is confident that the other
requirements of these regulations ensure that a State would not implement a new assessment system and make educational
judgments based on results from that system until the State has determined that the assessment accurately measures
what children are expected to know and be able to do.

 One commenter asked whether the feeder pattern concept would be acceptable in LEAs with schools that do not contain
a grade in which the State administers an assessment. For example, if a State assessment consists of a test in third
grade, the commenter asked whether it would be permissible for schools with only grades K&hyph;2 to be considered
part of a K&hyph;6 grade span. Another commenter suggested adding clarifying language that information be available
from at least one grade ``in each Chapter 1 school.''

does not believe, however, that this definition will frustrate the intent of these final regulations. If a State or
LEA is granted an exception to the current national evaluation standards, the alternative assessment may be used
for any appropriate purposes, including determining aggregate performance. Thus, if nationally normed tests are
not part of the alternative assessment, scores on those tests would not be used to determine aggregate performance
