Title: Survey by telephone of U.S. Business firms exporting to Egypt under AID's financing process (CIP)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Purpose: USAID/Cairo has contracted with Development Associates of Arlington, Virginia to evaluate the economic
and development impact of USAID's Commodity Import Program (CIP) in Egypt. Of importance is the impact it has had on
American companies, not only in current exports to Egypt, but in opening the possibilities for additional exports.
This survey is aimed at determining that impact.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a)(i) of additional U.S. note 3 to chapter 17 of the HTS (``additional U.S. note 3'') authorizes the Secretary
of Agriculture (``the Secretary'') to establish the total amount of sugars, syrups, and molasses that may be entered,
or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, under subheadings 1701.11.01, 1701.12.01, 1701.91.21, 1701.99.01,
1702.90.31, 1806.10.41, and 2106.90.11 of the HTS, during such period as shall be established by the Secretary. The
Secretary must determine such total amount as will give due consideration to the interests in the U.S. sugar market
of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(``GATT''). Such total amount consists of (1) a base quota amount, (2) a quota adjustment amount, and (3) an amount
reserved for the importation of specialty sugars as defined by the Untied States Trade Representative. The base quota
amount is allocated by the United States Trade Representative to the supplying countries and areas listed in paragraph
(b)(i) of additional U.S. note 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a)(ii) of additional U.S. note 3 authorizes the Secretary to modify any quantitative limitations (including
the time periods for which such limitations are applicable) which have previously been established under paragraph
(a)(i), if the Secretary determines that such modification is appropriate to give due consideration to the interests
in the U.S. sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the GATT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (iv) of additional U.S. note 3 also provides that sugar entering the United States during a quota period
may be charged to the previous quota period with the written approval of the Secretary. This notice will constitute
such written approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 11, 1993, the Secretary of Agriculture established the current quota period of October 1, 1992 through September
30, 1994 and a total quota amount of 2,268,000 metric tons, raw value. (58 FR 28545). This quota period now is being shortened
by two months, but any allocation of the current quota amount that has not been filled will be allowed to be entered during
the next quota period and charged back to the previous quota period. In addition, this notice establishes a new 14-month
quota period from August 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995, with a total quota amount of 1,322,978 metric tons.

Notice
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that I have determined, in accordance with additional U.S. note 3, that the current tariff-rate
quota period is changed from the period October 1, 1992 through September 30, 1994 to the period October 1, 1992 through
July 31, 1994. Any amounts previously allocated to any country for the quota period October 1, 1992 through September
30, 1994 that have not been entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, by July 31, 1994 and that are subsequently
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption will be charged to the quota period October 1, 1992 through July
31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I have further determined, in accordance with additional U.S. note 3, that the total amount of sugars, syrups, and
molasses described in subheadings 1701.11.01, 1701.12.01, 1701.91.21, 1701.99.01, 1702.90.31, 1806.10.41,
and 2106.90.11 of the HTS which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, during the tariff-rate
quota period from August 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995 is 1,322,978 metric tons, raw value. Of the 1,322,978 metric
tons, raw value, the base quota amount shall consist of 1,320,712 metric tons (including 84,680 metric tons for minimum
quota allocations); 1,656 metric tons, raw value, are reserved for specialty sugars as defined by the United States
Trade Representative, and 610 metric tons, raw value, are reserved as a quota adjustment amount. These amounts will
be allocated to supplying countries and areas by the United States Trade Representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I have also determined that this modification of the previous quota period and the establishment of the new quota period
and quota amount give due consideration to the interests in the United States sugar market of domestic producers and
materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The environmental assessment of this federally assisted action indicates that the project will not cause significant
local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. As a result of these findings, Hershel R. Read, State Conservationist,
has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement are not needed for this project.

A decline of salmonids (salmon and steelhead) is occurring in the watershed due in part to low water flow, high temperature,
poor water quality due to high water temperatures, and a loss of habitat. Loss of riparian vegetation from grazing
and clearing has reduced stream shade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plan involves land treatment measures and technical assistance to enhance the water quantity and quality in the
Hayfork Creek Watershed for restoration of the anadromous fisheries. This will be accomplished through (1) landowner
education and assistance in the conservation of ranch and water resources, (2) improving water conveyance systems
and redirecting water conserved to benefit surface flows and aquatic habitat and fisheries, and (3) restoration
of riparian corridors. The plan will be carried out through long-term contracts for land treatment. Project installation
will be carried out in cooperation with the South Fork Trinity River Coordinated Resource Management Planning (CRMP)
group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plan proposes to provide 5 staff years of technical assistance to work with landusers on the development of practices
of irrigation water management, proper grazing use, and channel vegetation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Notice of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency
and to various Federal, State and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are
available to fill single copy requests at the above address. Basic data developed during the environmental assessment
is on file and may be reviewed by contacting Romeo A. Rivera, Director, Water Resources Planning, (916) 757&hyph;8261.

Postponement of Final Determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 8, 1994, (59 FR 30911, June 16, 1994), the Department of Commerce (the Department) issued its preliminary determination
in the antidumping duty investigation of certain cased pencils from the PRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 21, 1994, in accordance with section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, (the Act) respondents
requested that the Department postpone its final determination in this investigation until 135 days after the date
of publication of the preliminary determination. Under section 735(a)(2) of the Act and section 353.20(b) of the
Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.20(b)) if, subsequent to an affirmative preliminary determination, the Department
receives a written, substantiated request for postponement of the final determination from producers or resellers
of a significant proportion of the merchandise, the Department will, absent compelling reasons for denial, grant
the request. Accordingly, we are postponing our final determination in this investigation until October 21, 1994.

Scope of Investigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this investigation are Class 150 stainless steel threaded (SST) pipe fittings, defined as
cast or forged stainless steel products used to connect pipe sections with an ability to withstand normal pressure
service (150 pounds per square inch (psi) at 350 degrees Fahrenheit and 300 psi at 20 to 150 degrees Fahrenheit) as well
as resistance to corrosion or extreme temperatures, or prevention of metallic contamination to materials in the
system. Included in the scope of this investigation are both finished and unfinished Class 150 SST pipe fittings of
any size. Unfinished Class 150 SST pipe fittings are defined as those products that have been advanced after casting
or forging, but which require threading and machining to finish the fittings; finished Class 150 SST pipe fittings
are defined as those products that have been formed in the shape of elbows, tees, reducers, etc. and have been further
advanced after casting or forging, and require no further processing to be acceptable as a finished product to the
end user. Class 150 SST pipe fittings are composed of alloys including, but not limited to, 304 and 316, and are manufactured
in the shape of 90-degree elbows, 45-degree elbows, street elbows, tees, crosses, couplings, reducing couplings,
half-couplings, caps, square head plugs, hex head plugs, hex bushings, unions, locknuts, and welding spuds. Excluded
from the scope of investigation are SST pipe fittings manufactured in the shape of nipples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The products under investigation are currently classifiable under subheadings 7307.19.9030, 7307.19.9060, 7307.19.9080,
7307.22.1000, 7307.22.5000, and 7307.29.0090 of the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Termination of Investigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 28, 1994, the Department of Commerce (The Department) published its final antidumping duty determination
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(59 FR 33432). In a letter dated July 22, 1994, petitioners, Capital Manufacturing Co. and Alloy Stainless Products,
Co., notified the Department that they were withdrawing their August 2, 1993, petition, and requested termination
of the antidumping investigation. A copy of this letter is available in the public file, located in room B&hyph;099
of the main building of the Department of Commerce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.17(a), upon the petitioner's withdrawal of the petition, the Department may terminate
an investigation after notice to all parties to the proceeding and after consultation with the International Trade
Commission (ITC). Furthermore, the Department may not terminate an investigation unless it concludes that termination
is in the public interest. We have notified all parties to the proceeding and consulted with the ITC. Further, because
no party has objected to termination, it is reasonable to conclude that doing so will not disadvantage a U.S. industry
producing a like product. Consequently, we have concluded that termination of the investigation is in the public
interest. Accordingly, we are terminating the antidumping investigation of Class 150 stainless steel threaded
pipe fittings from Taiwan. This action is taken pursuant to section 734(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended,
and 19 CFR 353.17(a).

Termination of Suspension of Liquidation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Commerce has instructed the U.S. Customs Service to terminate suspension of liquidation of entries
of Class 150 stainless steel threaded pipe fittings from Taiwan, entered or withdrawn from the warehouse for consumption,
on or after March 8, 1994. All estimated antidumping duties deposited on entries of the subject merchandise shall
be refunded and the bonds or other securities released at the time of liquidation.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to a request by the Municipal Castings Fair Trade Council and its individually-named members (petitioner),
the Department of Commerce (the Department) has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order
on iron construction castings from Canada. The review covers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four manufacturers/exporters of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period March 1, 1991, through

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 29, 1992. For these preliminary results, we applied best information available (BIA) for all four of the
manufacturers/exporters. The review indicates the existence of dumping margins during the period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 5, 1989, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an antidumping duty order on iron construction castings from Canada (51 FR 7890). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)
the petitioner requested an administrative review of four manufacturers/exporters. We published the notice of
initiation on April 13, 1992 (57 FR 12797). The Department is now conducting that administrative review in accordance
with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by this review are shipments of certain heavy and light iron construction castings. Heavy castings,
are limited to manhole covers, rings, and frames, catch basin grates and frames, cleanout covers and frames used for
drainage or access purposes for public utility, water, and sanitary systems, from Canada, classifiable under Harmonized
Tariff Schedule (HTS) item numbers 7325.10.0010 and 7325.10.0050. Light castings are limited to valve, service,
and meter boxes which are placed below ground to encase water, gas, or other valves, or water and gas meters, classifiable
as light castings under HTS item numbers 8306.29.0000 and 8310.00.0000. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience
and Customs purposes only. The written description remains dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This review covers sales of certain Canadian iron construction castings by Associated Foundry (Associated), Fonderie
LaPerle/LaPerle Foundry Division (LaPerle), Penticton Foundry Ltd. (Penticton), and Titan Foundry Ltd. (Titan),
during the period March 1, 1991, through February 29, 1992.

Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received only one questionnaire response, and that was from LaPerle. Based on our analysis of LaPerle's response,
we have determined that LaPerle is related to other manufacturers/exporters for which it did not provide information.
LaPerle and its related entities meet all five criteria, in addition to ownership, that the Department considers
in determining whether to collapse related parties, as laid out in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 37099 (July 9, 1993). The five criteria, in addition to ownership, are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether companies have interlocking boards of directors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether companies have similar production processes, facilities or equipment so as to facilitate shifting
of production between facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether companies operate as separate and distinct entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether companies share marketing and sales information or offices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether companies are involved in the pricing or production decisions of the other entity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on our analysis of these criteria, the information on the record indicates that 13 other companies, in addition
to those included in the notice of initiation of administrative review, are sufficiently related to be collapsed.
It is our preliminary determination LaPerle and all its related companies should be treated as a single entity. (For
more information see the analysis memorandum for the preliminary results.) Therefore, in effect, we are now conducting
a review of one single company, comprised of various individual components, including LaPerle.

In conducting our analysis of related parties in this review, we issued three supplemental questionnaires and granted
extensions for several of the responses. In spite of this, LaPerle did not provide us with enough information to adequately
support its position as an independent entity. Because none of the individual components of this entity responded
to our questionnaire, other than LaPerle, and because LaPerle, as the responding party, failed to submit a consolidated
response, only a small fraction of the required information was provided.

parties related to it, and we are not able to use LaPerle's responses for purposes of this review. Therefore, we have
considered LaPerle uncooperative. The application of first-tier BIA is appropriate because LaPerle has impeded
the proceeding by failing to give the Department the information necessary to conduct the review and by failing to
provide sufficient support that it was independent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Department's practice (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 58 FR 39729, July 26, 1993, we have applied first-tier BIA to the entity as a whole. The first-tier BIA rate in this case
is 9.8 percent, which is the highest of the rates for any firm in the original investigation (

Interested parties may request disclosure within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice and may request a
hearing within 10 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publication
or the first business day thereafter. Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted
no later than 30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to
issues raised in those comments, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication of this notice. The
Department will publish the final results of this administrative review, including the results of its analysis of
issues raised when submitted in written form, or mentioned at a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
The Department will issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because we have completed to review for the period, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993, the cash deposit requirement for merchandise subject to the order will not
be changed by the final results of this administrative review, except in the case of two of the entity's components.
Moreover, since there were no requests for reviews of other companies which were related to LaPerle, entries of all
the additional firms' merchandise have been liquidated in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(e). Therefore, only two
of the companies not included in the notice of initiation will have cash deposit rates established by this administrative
review. Accordingly, for these two firms we will instruct Customs to require cash deposits of 9.8 percent, the rate
assigned to the entire entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These administrative review and this notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C.

Final Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Commerce (the Department) determines that phthalic anhydride (PA) from Venezuela is being, or
is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930,
as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.

Case History

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the publication of our affirmative preliminary determination on May 27, 1994 (58 FR 27532), the following events
have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 27, 1994, we issued a deficiency letter to Oxidaciones Organicas, C.A. (Oxidor), respondent in this investigation,
regarding its response to Section D of the antidumping questionnaire. (Section D requests information on cost of
production and constructed value.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 6, 1994, Oxidor informed the Department that it would no longer be participating in the investigation due to
the cost and time required to fully respond to the supplemental cost questionnaire and participate in the verification.

Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The product covered by this investigation is PA, an aromatic synthetic organic chemical usually produced from a primary
petrochemical called orthoxylene, although it is sometimes produced from naphthalene. PA is predominately used
in the production of plasticizers, unsaturated polyester resins, and alkyd resins, which in turn are generally used
to produce plastics and paints. This investigation covers PA sold in either flaked or molten form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PA is classifiable under subheading 2917.35.00 of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(HTSUS). The HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes. Our written description of the scope
of this investigation is dispositive.

Period of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The period of investigation is May 1, 1993, to October 31, 1993.

Best Information Available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the ``Case History'' section of this notice, Oxidor informed the Department that it would not reply to the
Department's Section D deficiency letter and that it would not participate in verification. Section 776(c) of the
Act provides that whenever a party refuses or is unable to produce information requested in a timely manner and in the
form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation, the Department shall use the best information
otherwise available (BIA). We have done so in this investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assigning BIA, the Department applies a two-tiered methodology based on the degree of a respondent's cooperation.
Under this methodology, the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon those respondents who refuse to cooperate
or otherwise significantly impede the proceeding.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because Oxidor refused to reply to the Department's deficiency questionnaire and refused verification, we find
it has been uncooperative in this investigation. As BIA for Oxidor, we are assigning the highest margin alleged in
the petition because that margin is higher than the only calculated rate in this investigation. The highest margin
in the petition is 52.00 percent. (

In accordance with section 735(c)(4) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation
of all entries of PA from Venezuela, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are entered,

from Venezuela. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The estimated dumping
margins are as follows:

In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the International Trade Commission (ITC) of our determination.
As our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring,
or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry within 45 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the ITC determines that material injury or threat of material injury does not exist, the proceeding will be terminated
and all securities posted as a result of the suspension of liquidation will be refunded or cancelled. However, if the
ITC determines that such injury does exist, we will issue an antidumping duty order directing Customs officers to
assess antidumping duties on PA from Venezuela entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the
date of suspension of liquidation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this investigation, phthalic anhydride (``PA'') is an aromatic synthetic organic chemical usually
produced from a primary petrochemical called orthoxylene, although sometimes it is produced from naphthalene.
PA is predominately used in the production of plasticizers, unsaturated polyester resins, and alkyd resins, which
in turn are generally used to produced plastics and paints. The subject PA is produced in two physical forms, molten
and flaked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

On August 31, 1990, Venezuela became a contracting party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Since
a country cannot qualify as a ``country under the Agreement'' under section 701(b)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as
amended (``the Act'') if it is a contracting party to the GATT, Venezuela is no longer eligible for treatment as a ``country
under the Agreement'' within the meaning of section 701(b)(3) of the Act. However, because Venezuela is a GATT contracting
party and the merchandise under investigation is non-dutiable, the ITC is required to determine whether, pursuant
to section 303(a)(2) of the Act, imports of the merchandise from Venezuela materially injure, or threaten material
injury to, a U.S. industry. On December 1, 1993, the ITC preliminary determined that there is a reasonable indication
that an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason of imports of PA from Venezuela.

The Government of Venezuela (``GOV'') and Oxidaciones Organicas, C.A. (``Oxidor'') are respondents. While there
are two producers of PA in Venezuela, Oxidor accounted for over 85 percent of exports to the United States during the
POI and, hence, was selected as the sole respondent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners alleged that the government-owned petrochemical company, Petroquimica de Venezuela, C.A. (``Pequiven''),
is selling orthoxylene (an input product to PA) to Venezuelan producers of PA at preferential prices, thus providing
a subsidy under section 771(5)(A)(ii)(II) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to measure the preferential provision of goods, the Department has developed a hierarchy of benchmarks to
compare with the government's price for the good. The Department's preferred benchmark is non-selective prices
the government charges to the same or other users (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Request for Public Comments, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
54 FR 23366 (May 31, 1989), Section 355.44(f)(1)) (``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
''). If there is no non-selective benchmark price, the Department normally looks to the alternative benchmarks listed
in section 355.44(f)(2) of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The alternative benchmarks are as follows: (1) The price charged by the same seller for a similar or related good,
(2) the price charged by other sellers in the same jurisdiction for an identical good, (3) the same seller's cost of
producing the good, and (4) the price paid outside the jurisdiction for an identical good.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the preliminary determination, the Department had no information to indicate that there was a non-specific price
for orthoxylene. Pequiven reported that within Venezuela it sold orthoxylene only to the two PA producers, Oxidor
and Anhiven, who were charged the same price. However, we discovered at verification that Pequiven also made one sale
during the POI to a non-PA producer who was charged a different price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has faced a similar situation in the past. In the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aluminum Sulfate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
''), the Department examined a government-owned company which sold to two producers of the subject merchandise,
SULFORCA and FERRALCA. These two producers were charged different prices for the input product. One factor we evaluated
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aluminum Sulfate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to determine whether the price charged to FERRALCA could be used as a benchmark for SULFORCA, was to compare the quantity
and other terms of sale to the two companies. ``After comparing the quantities and terms of SULFORCA's contract to
the quantities and terms of FERRALCA's purchase orders, we determined that these [the quantities and terms] did not
provide a basis for justifying the price difference involved.'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aluminum Sulfate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, at 43441). Because the difference in price could not be attributed to the difference in quantity and terms, the price
charged to FERRALCA was determined to be a reliable benchmark.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the analysis performed in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aluminum Sulfate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we have examined the quantities and terms of Pequiven's sales to the non-PA producer and compared them to the quantities
and terms of Pequiven's sales to Oxidor. We have concluded that Pequiven's price to the non-PA producer would not be
a reliable benchmark price because there was only one sale in the POI and the sale involved too small a quantity to be
comparable to the sales made to Oxidor and Anhiven. In addition, there is no other evidence on the record indicating
that this price could serve as a proper benchmark. Therefore, we have determined that the price charged to the non-PA
producer cannot serve as an appropriate benchmark. Due to the proprietary nature of the quantities and terms of these
sales, we cannot address them in this notice; however there is a proprietary concurrence memorandum on the record
that explains the basis of our determination (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Concurrence Memorandum, August 3, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since we have concluded that we cannot use the government's price for the same good as our benchmark, we have evaluated
the alternative benchmarks in our hierarchy. The first alternative in the hierarchy is the price charged by the same
seller for a similar or related good. Consistent with our preliminary determination, we have determined that we cannot
use the first alternative benchmark because Pequiven does not sell any of the products identified on the record as
being similar to orthoxylene (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
paraxylene, metaxylene and mixed-xylene).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second alternative listed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the price charged within the jurisdiction by other sellers for an identical good or service. As stated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Carbon Black from Mexico: Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (51 FR 13269, April 18, 1986), ``[t]hese other sellers may include private sellers within the jurisdiction or foreign
sellers selling into the jurisdiction *&blank;*&blank;*'' Pequiven is the only domestic producer/seller of orthoxylene
in Venezuela. However, orthoxylene was imported into Venezuela during the POI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preliminary determination, we used U.S. export statistics on shipments of orthoxylene to Venezuela during
the period 1992&hyph;1993. From these statistics, we used the information on the one entry that occurred during the
POI to calculate a benchmark price, since this was ``a price charged within the jurisdiction by other sellers for an
identical good.'' Based on our comparison of Pequiven's price for orthoxylene with the U.S. export price (adjusted
for freight and insurance), we preliminarily determined that the Pequiven's price to Oxidor was non-preferential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have examined this transaction carefully for purposes of our final determination to determine whether it can serve
as a proper benchmark for sales of orthoxylene by Pequiven. First, we have considered the quantity involved and the
terms of sale. Based on a comparison of the U.S. export to Pequiven's monthly sales to the two PA producers, we have determined
that this sale is within the range of quantities purchased from Pequiven each month and, therefore, involves sufficiently
large quantities to serve as an appropriate benchmark.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, with respect to the terms of sale, petitioners argued that the prices reported in the U.S. export statistics
are spot prices, whereas Pequiven's prices are on a contract basis. Petitioners stated that this fact should preclude
the Department from using the U.S. export data as a benchmark since they are incomparable to Pequiven's prices. Respondents
countered that, while Pequiven did have a contract with its customers, the terms of ``contract'' and ``spot'' sales
are different in Venezuela than in the United States. Specifically, they argued that contract needs and obligations
of secured quantity are much greater in the U.S. than in Venezuela. Because the Venezuelan market is so small, respondents
took the position that a spot price is a more appropriate benchmark. Both parties have submitted world market prices
for orthoxylene as reported by the industry publications of several private reporting agencies to support their
arguments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information provided by both parties, we determined that there is a consistent difference between contract
and spot prices as reported by the private reporting agencies. Given that the degree of difference is consistent throughout
the POI, we believe it is possible to adjust the U.S. export spot price to make it comparable to a contract price. To calculate
the adjustment, we averaged the difference between monthly contract and spot prices as reported by the three reporting
services, and added the average spread for April, 1992 (the month of the single importation) to the U.S. export price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, because this import into Venezuela was reported on a FAS basis, we added an amount for ocean freight and
insurance from the United States to Venezuela. The amount for ocean freight and insurance was obtained from an independent
shipping company (see memorandum from case analyst to the file, January 14, 1994).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We then compared the adjusted U.S. export price to the price Pequiven charged for orthoxylene in the month that orthoxylene
was exported from the United States. Based on this comparison, we found that Pequiven's price was greater than the
price of imported U.S. orthoxylene.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a final check on the validity of the single importation as a benchmark, we averaged U.S. export prices (adjusted
for freight and insurance as well as the difference between the spot and contract prices) for the three months in which
we had data (one within the POI and two outside of the POI). For the two exports occurring outside of the POI, we added
the average spread between spot and contract prices for the POI to the export prices because monthly data on the difference
between spot and contract prices outside of the POI was not available. We compared the average of the adjusted U.S.
export prices to the average price Pequiven charged in the same three months and found that Pequiven's average price
was greater than the average price of the imports from the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we find that the GOV, through Pequiven, did not provide orthoxylene to PA producers at preferential rates.
Accordingly, we determine that no benefits which constitute bounties or grants within the meaning of the countervailing
duty law are being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters of PA from Venezuela.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Assistant Secretary for Administration, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, formally determined on
August 2, 1994, that portions of the meeting of the Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology which involve discussion
of proposed funding of the ATP and the MEP Programs may be closed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(B), because
those portions of the meetings will divulge matters the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly
frustrate implementation of proposed agency actions; and that portions of meetings which involve discussion of
the staffing of management and other positions at NIST may be closed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(6), because
divulging information discussed in those portions of the meeting is likely to reveal information of a personal nature
where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 28, 1994 (59 FR 14387), the National Weather Service (NWS) published its proposed certification for the relocation
of the San Francisco Weather Service Forecast Office, Redwood City, to Monterey, California, as required by the Weather
Service Modernization Act, 15 U.S.C. 313n, (the Act). In accordance with the Act, the NWS provided the public a 60-day
period in which to comment. After considering the comments received and consulting with the Modernization Transition
Committee, the NWS has determined that this action will not result in any degradation of service to the affected area
and has so certified. In accordance with the Act, the Secretary of Commerce has transmitted this certification to
Congress, and the NWS is now publishing the final certification together with a summary of the supporting documentation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Weather Service (NWS) is relocating its forecast office for Northern California from Redwood City to
Monterey. This is the first modernization action which requires a certification of no degradation of service under
the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the recommendation of the relevant Meteorologist-in-Charge, on June 24, 1994, the Assistant Administrator
of the NWS certified that this relocation will not result in any degradation of service to the affected area as required
by section 706 of the Act. On July 21, 1994, the Secretary of Commerce transmitted this certification to Congress.
The NWS is now completing the certification requirements by publishing the final relocation Certification in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The memorandum recommending certification considered and responded to all public comments received on the proposed
certification during the 60-day comment period. These comments and responses are set forth here for reference:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Both of the negative comments received centered on the belief that, if the Weather Forecast Office (WFO) is not located
in the San Francisco Bay area, services to that area could be degraded. Related to this point, these commentors focussed
on the distance of the move and argued that services would be degraded because the forecasters would not be able to ``see''
the conditions in the San Francisco Bay area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 First of all, these comments ignore the fact that this WSFO is responsible for weather services to all of northern California,
not just the San Francisco Bay area. The NWS is convinced that the relocation to Monterey will enhance weather forecasting
for the entire northern California service area. The logical conclusion of this comment is that each WFO must be located
in close proximity to the population center of its particular service area. Such a result obviously is not reasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, there will be no degradation of weather services to the San Francisco Bay Area itself. The services are
dependant on a variety of information which includes surface observations, weather radars, upper air soundings,
weather satellite data, spotter networks, aircraft reports, and numerical guidance from the National Meteorological
Center. The collection of this data and information is dependant on communications, not the exact location of that
office, and will be equally available to the Monterey office as it was in Redwood City.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commentor's concern, that the loss of personal contact between NWS personnel and the media and agencies might
degrade the overall quality of services, also is unfounded. The commentor is correct that ``the NWS depends heavily
on the media to get its warnings out.'' However, the primary means by which NWS warnings are disseminated is by telecommunications
systems such as NOAA Weather Wire, not by personal contacts. The commentor claims that television reporters in the
San Francisco area ``regularly visit and report from the office in Redwood City during weather emergencies, and that
appearances on camera by NWS forecasters add immediacy to developing weather stories and allow the public to receive
information directly from the source.'' There are network television affiliates in the Monterey area that could
provide on camera interviews with the forecasting staff from the office in Monterey. With modern day telecommunications,
these interviews can easily be broadcast over television stations located in the San Francisco Bay area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contact with cooperating and user agencies such as FEMA and emergency managers in the San Francisco Bay area will continue
even if the WSFO is relocated to Monterey. There is no reason to assume these contacts, that are currently done face-to-face,
will be less effective in the future if they are done mostly via telephone, as is done now for users in the WSFO's service
area that are outside the immediate San Francisco Bay area. Moreover, contact with cooperators and users will be enhanced
by the addition of a dedicated Warning Coordination Meteorologist to the staff at Monterey.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The two commentors opposed to the relocation also argued that, if the WFO is not located in the San Francisco Bay area,
services would be degraded because of the climatological differences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This comment is related to that above but requires some additional elaboration. There are numerous climatological
zones located in central and northern California. A primary goal of the NWS modernization is to enable each future
WFO to provide consistent weather services to its entire area of responsibility which includes the numerous climatological
regimes. To accomplish this the NWS will employ advanced computers which will greatly improve the numerical guidance
available to forecasters. Advanced weather satellites will make higher resolution imagery available allowing
forecasters to see in detail what is occurring over their area of responsibility. The number and frequency of surface
observations will be increased through the deployment of ASOS. A national network of WSR&hyph;88D Doppler radars
is already halfway completed. This will provide forecasters in Monterey the ability to view the atmosphere in more
detail than ever before possible. Not just over the San Francisco Bay area, but over all of northern and central California.
Any attempt to compare services as they exist today with those that will be available in the future is a disservice to
all the users of weather services in northern and central California.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The two commentors opposed to the relocation believe that a number of experienced forecasters will elect to retire
instead of relocate and the result will be degradation of services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Clearly, the ability of the NWS to relocate an office (or to take a number of other modernization actions) cannot be
contingent upon the number of employees that happen to retire during the process. Planning for these actions begins
years in advance whereas the actual number of employees who will retire is not known for certain until the day the move
takes place. Therefore, the NWS has to be prepared to deal with whatever vacancies occur in the same way it deals with
vacancies at any office which occur all the time, when employees retire or transfer to other jobs. In this situation,
even in the worst case scenario, a loss of 7 employees, the potential for any short term effects is negligible in view
of the fact that the office will retain 4 out of 5 lead forecasters; that it has already recruited 3 experienced forecasters
and has identified 2 additional experienced forecasters that could be detailed to Monterey during the transition;
and that the office will be able to field experienced personnel on each shift.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commentors stated that with the new technologies the proposed relocation of the NWS forecast office would not
degrade services that, in fact, they expect an enhancement of weather services. Two of the commentors stated that
collocating with the Naval Post Graduate School would be beneficial to the NWS and create new opportunities for collaborative
research activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NWS agrees. Improved warning and forecast capabilities are expected to result from this collocation. Improved
access to Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center data sources including satellite imagery from the Defense Meteorological
Satellite System as well as global, regional, and wave numerical forecast models will enable improved weather services.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commentor believed that the relocation would be more costly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The issue of cost associated with the office move is not relevant to certification. However, an Economic Analysis
(EA) was completed on May 20, 1992, by the Special Engineering Program Office which concluded that the relocation
to Monterey was the most economical. In July, 1993, the Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General validated
that EA and determined the Monterey location to be the most economical to the Government.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Supplement to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) Extended
Test Range proposal is now available for review and comment. The Supplement to the DEIS was prepared to supplement
the information provided in the TMD Extended Test Range DEIS and identifies and assesses potential environmental
impacts of additional booster drop zones associated with the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) extended test range
alternative. Only the proposed additional booster drop zones for the WSMR extended test range alternative are discussed
in the Supplement. Assessment and discussions pertaining to the overall TMD Extended Test Range proposal are contained
in the DEIS published in January 1994. The four extended test range alternatives addressed in the DEIS are Eglin AFB,
Florida, (including Cape San Blas), Western Range California (including Vandenberg AFB, Point Mugu, and San Clemente
Island), and U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll and Wake Island in the mid-Pacific.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The TMB Extended Test Range DEIS identified potentially significant environmental impacts associated with the
original booster drop zones identified for the proposed Fort Wingate Depot Activity (FWDA), New Mexico, and Green
River Launch Complex (GRLC), Utah, sites. Through consultation with appropriate government agencies, meetings
with environmental groups, contacts with local land owners, and selection of a booster having different technical
requirements, the U.S. Army has identified additional booster drop zones that may reduce environmental impacts
resulting from booster drops. In keeping with the spirit and purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),
the Army determined that a Supplement to the DEIS is appropriate to address these additional booster drop zone because
of the significant new circumstances relevant to the proposed action. At this time, use of these additional drop zones
is preferred over the use of the original drop zones addressed in the prior DEIS. However, a decision will not be made
until at least 30 days after distribution of the Final Environmental Impact Statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Supplement to the DEIS addresses the potential environmental impacts that would result from the use of these additional
booster drop zones identified for the GRLC and FWDA located in the WSMR extended test range alternative. It also identifies
any mitigation measures that could avoid or lessen those impacts. Environmental resource topics evaluated include:
air quality, airspace, noise, geology and soils, water resources, socioeconomic, hazardous materials and waste,
health and safety, land use, infrastructure and transportation, and biological and cultural resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lead agency is the U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command. Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, United
States Air Force, United States Navy, and Federal Aviation Administration are cooperating agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of the TMD Extended Test Range DEIS, additional booster drop zones were identified
for the WSMR extended test range alternative. This Supplement to the DEIS supplements the information provided in
the TMD Extended Test Range DEIS and describes and analyzes the potential impacts of utilizing these additional target
vehicle booster drop zones located along the target missile flight paths between the GRLC and FWDA launch points and
the WSMR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action associated with the overall TMD program is to conduct multiple missile test and operational flights
and supporting activities along extended-range flight paths with missile intercepts occurring over existing test
ranges or open sea areas. The proposed action includes test site modifications and launch preparations required
in order to conduct test and operational flights. Approximately 100 flight test events would be conducted from one
or more off-range locations and potentially at more than one extended test range. The four ranges under consideration
are WSMR, New Mexico; Eglin AFB, Florida (including Cape San Blas); Western Range California (including Vandenberg
AFB, Point Mugu, and San Clemente Island); and U.S. Army Kwajalein Atoll and Wake Island in the mid-Pacific. For the
purpose of environmental analysis, four tests per month from each extended test range alternative are assumed. Tests
would begin in 1995 and continue through 2000.

<DOCTITLE>Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Disposal and Reuse of Naval Training Center Orlando,
Orlando, FL</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality
(CEQ) regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508), the Department of the Navy announces its intent to prepare an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental effects of the disposal and reuse of Naval Training Center (NTC)
Orlando, Florida. This disposal and reuse is being conducted in compliance with the Defense Base Closure and Realignment
Act (BCRA) of 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with recommendations of the 1993 Base Closure and Realignment Commission, the Navy plans to close NTC
Orlando, and its three remote sites: Area ``C'', Herndon Annex, and NTC Annex. Approximately 2,020 acres and associated
buildings will be available for reuse following closure of NTC Orlando and the remote sites. NTC Orlando's functions
and operations will be relocated to other Department of Defense locations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action involves the disposal of land, buildings, and infrastructure of NTC Orlando for subsequent use.
As required by the NEPA process, the Navy will evaluate alternative reuses for the NTC Orlando properties. In accordance
with CEQ regulations, the ``no-action'' alternative of Navy retention of NTC Orlando properties in a caretaker status
will also be addressed in the EIS. However, because the process is mandated by the BCRA, selection of the ``no-action''
alternative would be considered impracticable for the Navy to implement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reuse of NTC Orlando's assets will be defined in coordination with the City of Orlando NTC Reuse Commission. Anticipated
uses include, but are not limited to: residential, industrial, commercial, office, recreational, or a combination
of these. Major environmental issues that will be addressed in the EIS include, but are not limited to: air quality,
water quality, wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, and socioeconomic impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Navy will initiate a scoping process for the purpose of determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying
the significant issues related to this action. Navy will hold a public scoping meeting on Thursday, August 25, 1994,
beginning at 7 p.m., at the Audubon Park Elementary School, 1500 Falcon Drive, Orlando, Florida. This meeting will
be advertised in the Orlando area newspapers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A brief presentation will precede request for public comment. Navy representatives will be available at this meeting
to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern to the public. It is important that federal, state,
and local agencies and interested individuals take this opportunity to identify environmental concerns that should
be addressed during the preparation of the EIS. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit
oral comments to five minutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comment in addition to, or in lieu of, oral
comments at the public meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues or topics
which the commenter believes the EIS should address. Written statements and/or questions regarding the scoping
process should be mailed no later than September 26, 1994, to: Commanding Officer, Southern Division, Naval Facilities
Engineering Command, P.O. Box 190010, North Charleston, SC 29419&hyph;9010 (Attn: Mr. Ronnie Lattimore, Code 203RL),

At a minimum, the Board is required to meet quarterly. Additional time will most likely be required for subcommittee
meetings and to fulfill the duties assigned to the Board. By law, the Board is required to hold its first meeting no later
than May 15, 1995. However, the Secretary and Assistant Secretary believe that the restructuring of the Department's
education research and dissemination effort is of such urgency and high priority that they would like to have the advice
of and collaboration with the Board begin as soon as possible. Therefore, they anticipate holding the Board's first
meeting in late November, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The pending award is based on an unsolicited application for the project entitled ``Enhancement of Methane Conversion
Using Electric Fields''. The overall objective of this project is to develop a novel, economical process for the conversion
of natural gas to more valuable products such as methanol, ethylene, and other organic oxygenates or higher hydrocarbons.
Specifically, the University of Oklahoma will investigate and develop electric field conversion and electric field-enhanced
catalytic conversion of methane, resulting in an economical process or processes for the direct conversion of natural
gas to more valuable products. The most promising process configurations and the most promising operating conditions
will be identified and the economic viability of the processes evaluated. The overall scientific or technical merits
of the new technology from these research efforts in methane conversion are primarily in the areas of transportation
and chemical feedstocks. Much of the natural gas occurs in remote areas in Alaska, and offshore reservoirs. Because
of this remoteness, the cost of transporting this gas to markets may eventually prohibit the utilization of these
resources. Therefore, considerable interest is being shown in developing a relatively simple, cost effective,
process suitable for installation at the well-head for conversion of methane to transportable liquid. Technically
this would provide new market areas for natural gas and would provide the means for transporting costly natural gas
to market at acceptable costs. If these techniques were developed it could be used to offset imported oil to this country
and would provide new transportation fuels, energy fuels and chemical feedstocks to the marketplace.

About the SWEIS. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has a policy to prepare SWEISs for large, multi-facility DOE sites [10 CFR 1021.330], such as LANL.
The purpose of a SWEIS is to provide DOE and its stakeholders with a comprehensive look at the environmental impacts
caused by its operations and activities at a site. The NEPA process allows for Federal, State, tribal, county, municipal
and public participation in the environmental review and resultant decisionmaking process. A SWEIS was last prepared
for LANL in 1979 [DOE/EIS&hyph;0018]. The planned SWEIS would replace that document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A SWEIS is a useful tool for DOE to manage its facilities and operations. It provides the DOE decisionmakers, site management,
and the public with comprehensive information on the cumulative impact of past, ongoing and planned activities at
a site in order to plan for quality stewardship of the resources entrusted to DOE's care. A SWEIS can be used to establish
an environmentally-sound operating envelope for site activities and establish thresholds of significance to identify
future environmental impacts. The SWEIS is expected to support later NEPA reviews by allowing DOE to focus on project-specific
issues and to narrow and simplify the scope of later reviews. This process is called ``tiering'' [40 CFR 1508.28].
DOE believes that the SWEIS analysis will generally provide adequate NEPA coverage for those activities and projects
covered by the SWEIS. However, a SWEIS may not replace the need for future, project-specific NEPA reviews as future
proposals for LANL facilities are developed. In accordance with 10 CFR 1021.330(d), DOE will evaluate the SWEIS at
least every five years after its completion to determine whether it should be revised.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Site-wide Analysis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SWEIS will address operations and planned activities at LANL foreseen within the next 5 to 10 years. The SWEIS will
focus on operating practices and facility management; DOE does not expect to be able to anticipate all future research
and development projects that LANL may be called upon to support over the next ten years. The Department anticipates
that the SWEIS will provide an analysis of all activities at LANL and all DOE land management activities related to
operations at LANL. The SWEIS will also examine DOE's ongoing obligations to the surrounding community under the
Atomic Energy Communities Act [42 U.S.C. 2301 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.], including proposals to transfer certain tracts of DOE-administered land to Los Alamos County. The Department
intends to use the SWEIS to develop: mitigation measures for operating and facilities management practices; a nuclear
materials storage and handling strategy; a waste management strategy; an environmental restoration strategy;
and a land transfer strategy for LANL. The SWEIS will include an analysis of the impacts of operating all major facilities
at LANL. Specific research projects or facility proposals that are not included within the SWEIS analysis would be
subject to project-specific NEPA reviews.

Los Alamos National Laboratory's mission. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department coordinates and administers the energy functions of the Federal government. Among other things,
it is responsible for the nuclear weapons program, research and development of energy technologies, and basic science
research. The Laboratory is one of DOE's primary research and development laboratories. It was established in 1943
to provide research, design, and testing for nuclear weapons and nuclear materials and remains one of the three laboratories
in DOE's nuclear weapons complex. Over the past 50 years, LANL's mission has expanded to include research in energy,
materials science, nuclear safeguards and security, biomedical science, computational science, environmental
protection and cleanup, and other basic science research. In addition to work done in support of DOE programs, LANL
provides research and science services for other Federal agencies, universities, foreign countries, and private
industry. The Laboratory is one of the largest multiprogram research laboratories in the world, with an annual budget
of about $1 billion and about 10,000 contractor and sub-contractor employees. The Laboratory covers about 43 square
miles of Federal land in north-central New Mexico in Los Alamos and Santa Fe Counties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Secretary of Energy has initiated an independent review to provide recommendations on the future missions of
all DOE Laboratories. The SWEIS will incorporate any recommendations accepted by DOE regarding the future missions
of LANL.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, certain of LANL's mission elements are being considered in several other broad-scale NEPA reviews. In
addition, about 20 proposed projects at LANL are in the process of having either an Environmental Assessment (EA)
or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic EIS (PEIS) [Notice of Intent, 55 FR 42633] will
analyze the DOE plan to formulate and implement an integrated Environmental Management program. The Laboratory
is one of the alternative sites proposed to store and process transuranic radioactive waste and store, process, and
provide on-site disposal for low-level radioactive waste, possibly including material generated at locations
other than LANL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nuclear Weapons Complex Reconfiguration PEIS [revised Notice of Intent, 56 FR 39528] analyzes alternatives
for the reconfiguration of the weapons complex due to nuclear weapons stockpile reductions. The Department currently
is considering how the scope of this PEIS should be revised further to reflect more recent budget and stockpile reduction
decisions. At this time, the Reconfiguration PEIS and its related decisions are not expected to change the weapons
mission at LANL.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Advanced Neutron Source EIS analyzes the siting, construction and operation of a research nuclear reactor [Notice
of Intent, 58 FR 31019]. The Laboratory is being considered as an alternative to the preferred site at DOE's Oak Ridge
Reservation, Tennessee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Programmatic Spent Nuclear Fuel Management and INEL Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programs
EIS includes a programmatic analysis of transporting, processing, and storing spent nuclear reactor fuel [Notice
of Availability, Draft EIS, 59 FR 32688]. The Laboratory has generated spent fuel and continues to temporarily store
this material pending the outcome of programmatic decisions following the spent fuel EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is preparing a site-wide EIS for all activities at its Pantex Plant, near Amarillo, Texas [Notice of
Intent, 59 FR 26635]. The primary mission of this facility is disassembly of nuclear weapons. The Pantex site-wide
EIS will also take a programmatic look at storing disassembled nuclear weapons components. The Laboratory disassembles
and temporarily stores radioisotopic thermoelectric generators (radioactive heat sources) that have been removed
from retired weapons and could be considered as an alternative site for other components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is preparing a PEIS for Storage and Disposition of Weapons-Usable Fissile Materials [Notice of Intent,
59 FR 31985]. The PEIS will analyze alternatives for the long-term storage and disposition of surplus nuclear materials
in order to minimize the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons capability in the world. Phase I of the project will
be to provide safe, controlled, inspectable interim storage. As part of this phase, DOE is performing a vulnerability
study to determine the risks associated with current storage of nuclear materials. Phase II will be long-term storage
or disposition of surplus material. Among other things, the PEIS will analyze a new, consolidated long-term storage
facility at five candidate sites (LANL is not a candidate site), and continued use of interim storage facilities.
The Laboratory now stores some nuclear materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is preparing a programmatic EA on its proposal to produce medical isotopes for medical applications
such as diagnostics and chemotherapy [EA determination, 02/24/93]. The proposal involves irradiating targets
in a nuclear reactor, processing the material, and disposing of waste. The original proposal was to use the Omega West
Reactor at LANL to produce the isotopes. Since that time, DOE has decided to permanently shut down that reactor, and
it would not be used for this purpose. Alternatives currently under consideration involving LANL facilities would
include fabricating targets at the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building, processing and recycling irradiated
material at that facility, and disposing of low-level radioactive waste at LANL's waste management area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Besides these broad-scale NEPA documents, DOE is in the process of conducting several environmental analyses for
specific proposed projects at LANL or has made preliminary plans to start such reviews. Through this prescoping process,
the public is invited to comment as to whether the NEPA reviews listed in Tables 1 and 2 should precede, be incorporated
into, or be deferred until after the SWEIS. In accordance with requests from the State, tribes, and the public, DOE
invites public comment as to which of these ongoing NEPA reviews should be included within the scope of alternatives
to be analyzed in the SWEIS. Specifically, as requested by the public, DOE invites comments to assist in determining
either: (1) The project has independent justification and would not prejudice the outcome of the SWEIS, and the NEPA
review can proceed; (2) the project is integral to alternatives to be analyzed in the SWEIS, and the NEPA review will
be included in the SWEIS; or (3) the project depends on the outcome of the SWEIS, and the NEPA review will be deferred
until after the SWEIS is completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These projects and DOE's initial recommendations are listed in Table 1. For a few projects, DOE does not make an initial
recommendation but will develop its recommendation after considering public comment. Table 1 also provides information
on the DOE program which sponsors the proposals and the date of the determination of the initial level of NEPA review.
The Department may initiate other projects while the SWEIS is being prepared; Table 2 lists planned projects for which
DOE believes NEPA reviews may be needed prior to completion of the SWEIS but has not yet issued a NEPA determination.
The public is invited to comment on whether these NEPA reviews should proceed independently of the SWEIS, or should
be included in the SWEIS analysis. The NOI will summarize comments received, explain whether or not DOE proposes to
continue with any of these NEPA reviews, and describe their relationship to the alternatives suggested in the NOI.

Issues and alternatives. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has not yet identified environmental issues or suggested alternatives for the SWEIS. These will be
developed over the next few months through the prescoping process with the assistance of stakeholder involvement.
The Department anticipates that alternatives will be issue-driven to allow alternatives to focus on activities
or operations which are of concern (``at issue'') to the agency or the public. The SWEIS would not analyze alternatives
to current practices for which neither the agency nor the public have identified any concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SWEIS will look at reasonable alternatives to the current situation. The public is specifically invited to comment
on whether analysis of an alternative which would describe phasing out all LANL operations and eventually decommissioning
all facilities (a ``shutdown alternative'') would be useful for comparison to ongoing activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1976, LANL was designated as one of four National Environmental Research Parks (NERPs). The NERPs were established
to contribute to the understanding of how people can live in balance with nature while enjoying the benefits of technology.
The Department has never instituted an active management plan for the LANL NERP. The public is specifically invited
to comment on whether the SWEIS should contain alternatives for managing the NERP or whether the designation should
be lifted.

The NEPA process. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DOE NEPA review process is described in the Council on Environmental Quality NEPA regulations [40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508]
and the DOE NEPA regulations [10 CFR Part 1021]. Through NEPA, Congress requires that Federal agencies consider environmental
impacts when making decisions and lay the decisionmaking process open to public scrutiny. An EIS documents the environmental
review of major Federal actions which may significantly affect the human environment; an EA may be used to determine
the need for an EIS or to document that no significant environmental impacts would be expected to occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS process begins with publication of a NOI to solicit public comments to assist in determining the scope of analysis
in the EIS [40 CFR 1501.7; 10 CFR 1021.311]. The Department documents the results of the scoping process and its plans
on how to conduct the EIS review in an Implementation Plan [10 CFR 1021.312]. An agency publishes a draft EIS to gain
public input into the environmental analysis before a final EIS is issued [40 CFR 1502.9; 10 CFR 1021.313]. An agency
issues a Record of Decision (ROD) to document its decision and to explain how the environmental considerations documented
in the EIS were balanced against other factors which led to the decision, such as technical, regulatory, or financial
considerations [40 CFR 1505.2; 10 CFR 1021.315].

A PEIS is a broad-scale analysis of proposed programs or policies [40 CFR 1502.4(b)], including proposals with geographically
connected actions [40 CFR 1502.4(c)(1)]. A SWEIS is a specific type of PEIS used to analyze connected actions at a DOE
site [10 CFR 1021.330]. An agency follows the same steps to prepare a SWEIS as for an EIS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department will conduct prescoping over the next few months. The results of prescoping will be provided in the
NOI. Through this Advance Notice, DOE asks other Federal agencies, the State, tribal governments, local governments,
and the general public to assist in identifying the scope of analysis for the SWEIS, including suggestions on issues,
alternatives, and other topics of interest. As part of the prescoping process, DOE will hold a series of public information
meetings and workshops, and provide other opportunities for public involvement. These will be publicized in local
media at least two weeks in advance. Other Federal agencies, which perform work at LANL or manage land that might be
affected by LANL activities, will be consulted about the SWEIS. Information briefings will be given to the State,
affected tribes, and local governments. Other parties with an interest in LANL's operations, such as private companies
having industrial partnerships with LANL, will be advised of the SWEIS process. The Department invites stakeholders
to submit written comments on the content of the SWEIS and suggestions on the SWEIS review process, including suggestions
for the conduct or format of public involvement opportunities, to the address given above. Comments received prior
to October 31, 1994, will be considered in developing the proposed issues and alternatives for the NOI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NOI will explain how comments and issues raised in the prescoping process have been incorporated into the suggested
alternatives and issues identified in that Notice. Publication of the NOI will be followed by a second invitation
to comment, public information meetings and workshops, and formal public scoping meetings. The results of the scoping
process will be documented in an Implementation Plan which will be made available to the public. Other Federal agencies,
the State, tribes, local governments, and the public will be given the opportunity to review and comment on the draft
SWEIS and participate in public hearings. A final SWEIS will be prepared which will explain how public comments on
the draft were considered. Following the final SWEIS, DOE intends to issue a ROD to document DOE's decisions regarding
the operation of LANL and explain the measures identified to mitigate any adverse impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of written comments, summaries of prescoping public meetings, and other materials pertaining to the development

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
Discussion: The existing wastewater treatment facility, completed in 1963, is still able to be operated safely and
reliably for a few more years, although design standards have changed considerably since that time. It is possible
that certain design details, such as wastewater stream source and type, may depend on sitewide decisions regarding
the location and use of other facilities at LANL. Detailed design for a replacement facility cannot be started until
the NEPA review is completed, which in turn would affect construction schedules. Initial Recommendation: Include
in the SWEIS.

Chemistry and Metallurgy Research (CMR) Building Upgrades, TA&hyph;3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part of a series of proposed infrastructure renovations to a 40-year-old facility used for various research projects.
CMR supports activities in several other LANL facilities. The purpose of the upgrades is to reduce risk, enhance the
safety margin, and provide for the continued safe, reliable, and effective use of the facility to support LANL missions
for at least another 20 to 30 years. Some renovations were covered by prior NEPA review and are currently underway

DP 09/13/93 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
Discussion: CMR first operated in 1952. Since then, environmental, safety and security design and operating requirements
have changed. Utility and infrastructure systems at CMR have aged and need to be replaced. Although current operations
in CMR are conducted in a way that protects the safety of workers, the public and the environment, some utility and infrastructure
upgrades would allow CMR operations to more closely adhere to current environmental, safety, and health requirements.
These include improving or replacing the building's structural, ventilation, electrical, facility monitoring,
waste management, and security systems. Another element of the CMR upgrade projects would refurbish Wings 2 and 4
at CMR, to accommodate LANL program needs. If the upgrades were deferred until after the SWEIS, CMR would continue
to be used but would also continue to deteriorate as the building systems aged. Initial Recommendation: Analyze in
the EA those components of the proposed upgrades that are needed to maintain the existing operation infrastructure,
improve safety of operations to workers and the general public, enhance CMR environmental management systems, and
provide for improved security. Include in the SWEIS the remainder of the proposed CMR upgrades which relate to long-term
programmatic needs, including refurbishing Wings 2 and 4.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed construction and operation of a new 3,000 square-foot building for mechanical and thermal tests on high
explosive materials and related assemblies in support of DOE's science-based stockpile stewardship program. The
proposal would consolidate in one building the high explosives work now done in several locations at LANL; the existing
facilities have deteriorated substantially and are inadequate to reliably support current needs. LANL has an ongoing
mission to evaluate aging weapons to ensure that the enduring nuclear weapons stockpile remains safe and reliable;
therefore, LANL must maintain the capability to assure the continuity and reliability of evaluation tests and the
safety of workers performing those tests

DP 03/10/92 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
Discussion: This is a small-scale construction project to consolidate ongoing activities at LANL and would not increase
LANL's existing testing program. If constructing the building were deferred until after the SWEIS, testing and evaluation
would continue in the existing facilities. Further deterioration of the existing buildings could disrupt the evaluation
program and create uncertainty in LANL's ability to safely and reliably test high explosives materials. A decision
to construct this building would not influence, nor be influenced by, sitewide decisions. Initial recommendation:
Proceed with EA.

Nuclear Materials Storage Facility Upgrade, TA&hyph;55 (Revision to 1986 EA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1986 EA covers actions currently needed to correct identified design and construction deficiencies. The revised
proposal is to increase the storage capacity of an existing nuclear materials storage vault from about 6.6 metric
tons of plutonium to about 25 metric tons (LANL's current inventory is about 2.6 metric tons), with a corresponding
increase in heat removal capability from 20 kilowatts to 75 kilowatts. The proposed upgrades would also allow storage
of material that generates more heat due to radioactive decay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
DP 08/10/93 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
Discussion: The 1986 EA analyzed constructing and operating the existing vault to consolidate nuclear material
storage at LANL. The proposal was revised in 1993 to allow for increased storage capability in the vault; the NEPA determination
was to revise the 1986 EA to provide the NEPA review for the increased capacity. If the revised NEPA review were to proceed,
DOE could make an early decision on whether to increase the storage capability of the existing vault. This would be
necessary if, prior to completing sitewide decisions, DOE needed to store at LANL more material, or different types
of material, than is now on-site or anticipated under current mission workloads. If a decision to increase the capacity
were deferred until after the SWEIS, DOE and LANL could continue to work towards correcting design and construction
deficiencies but could not undertake work that would lead to increased storage capacity. The SWEIS will be used to
help develop a nuclear materials storage and handling strategy, which would include projections of amounts of material
anticipated to be on site if LANL's weapons mission changed; sitewide decisions could influence decisions on the
future use and capacity of the vault. Initial Recommendation: Include in SWEIS the proposal to increase the vault's
capacity as part of nuclear materials storage and handling strategy. Work to correct existing design and construction
deficiencies would continue. Safety Testing of Pits Under Thermal Stress, CMR Building, TA&hyph;3 (formerly Fire
Resistant Pit Test Program). Proposed experiments to ensure that the enduring nuclear weapons stockpile is safe
and would not cause environmental or health problems in the event of a fire. The project would require minor modifications
to one of the hot cells at CMR, but would not require construction of any new facilities. The tests would be on disarmed
nuclear weapons devices (pits) to determine the potential for materials failure under fire conditions. LANL has
an ongoing mission to evaluate weapons to ensure that the enduring nuclear weapons stockpile remains safe and reliable

Discussion: This is a small-scale project that would not require construction of a new facility. It is not connected
to the infrastructure upgrades at CMR. If the test is deferred until after the SWEIS, some existing uncertainties
regarding the safety of the nuclear weapons in the enduring stockpile would remain unresolved. A decision to conduct
this test would not influence, nor be influenced by, sitewide decisions.

Decontaminate, Decommission and Demolish (DD&amp;D) Building 86, High Pressure Tritium Laboratory, TA&hyph;33.
Proposed demolition of a 40-year-old tritium-contaminated building after removing tritium-contaminated equipment.
Tritium inventory and equipment removal were covered under a separate NEPA review and are currently underway. The
building is being monitored to determine residual tritium levels. Future DD&amp;D of the building would be done under
the EM program, but the facility currently remains under DP management

DP/EM 11/04/91 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
Discussion: This facility has not operated since 1991. The immediate safety hazard was the removal of tritium-contaminated
equipment, which is being accomplished. There is no immediate need to perform DD&amp;D, and this action would produce
potentially contaminated building rubble that would have to be disposed of. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial Recommendation: Include in the SWEIS the remaining DD&amp;D to help determine potential waste volumes for
future disposal.

DP/EM 05/09/91
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
Discussion: A decision on where to locate the new landfill and how much capacity it should have would depend on sitewide
decisions regarding other facilities and a waste management strategy.

Actinide Source Term Waste Test Program, CMR Building, TA&hyph;3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposal to conduct tests to determine under controlled conditions how actinides (radioactive elements) behave
when exposed to brine. This test will be used to provide information important to the decision on whether or not to operate
the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, New Mexico. The test results are needed by 12/95 to complete the
WIPP performance assessment; to meet this schedule, tests must begin in 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
EM 12/09/92 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
Discussion: This is a small-scale project that would not require construction of a new facility. It is not connected
to the infrastructure upgrades at CMR. If the test program is deferred until after the SWEIS, existing uncertainties
regarding the performance of WIPP would remain unresolved and the schedule for completing the performance assessment
would not be met. A decision to conduct this test would not influence, nor be influenced by, sitewide decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial Recommendation: Proceed with EA.

Controlled Air Incinerator, Expanded Operations, TA&hyph;50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposal to use an existing incinerator to treat environmental restoration and operational waste generated at various
areas of LANL. The incinerator has previously been permitted and has operated a total of 2,607 hours over 15 years as
a research and development facility. Incinerating waste destroys toxic organic constituents and generally reduces
waste volume dramatically. Incineration is a recommended best demonstrated available technology within environmental
statutes. DOE has a milestone to complete a trial burn by 02/13/95 under its Federal Facility Compliance Agreement
with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). If the trial burn is successful, DOE and the EPA will develop a plan
for additional milestones

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
EM 10/20/90 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
Discussion: The Controlled Air Incinerator has undergone extensive safety and environmental upgrades to support
converting the facility's mission from a research and development facility to an operational facility in support
of treating both hazardous and mixed waste. The SWEIS will be used to develop a waste management strategy; analyzing
impacts of incinerating operational waste could be an important element of that strategy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial Recommendation: Include treatment operation of the incinerator in SWEIS. DOE makes no recommendation whether
work would continue to conduct a trial burn as required by the Federal Facility Compliance Agreement. DOE will continue
to work with regulators and the public to determine the appropriate activities for the Controlled Air Incinerator.

Expansion of Area G, Radioactive Waste Disposal Site, TA&hyph;54. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposal to expand an existing 63-acre low-level radioactive waste management area which is anticipated to reach
capacity in 3 to 5 years. The original proposal was to expand by an additional 70 acres to provide an additional 20 years
of disposal capability; a smaller 30-acre area is also considered, as well as a 5-acre area that would provide disposal
capability for up to 8 years. There are no archeological sites in the 5-acre area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
EM 10/20/90 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
Discussion: The original proposal would provide long-term, large-scale expansion of the waste disposal area. Some
expansion of LANL's waste handling capacity would be needed in 3 to 5 years to accommodate environmental restoration,
D&amp;D, and other operational waste. It is not clear at this time what the projected volumes of waste might be over
the next 20 years. LANL is increasing waste minimization efforts and it is possible that site missions could change;
the sitewide analysis will help develop projections of waste volume and type. The smaller, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5-acre proposal would allow for up to 8 years of additional disposal capacity in the event that it is needed while the
sitewide analysis is being completed. If no expansion takes place prior to the SWEIS, it is possible that existing
waste disposal areas may be filled prior to completing sitewide decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial Recommendation: Include in the SWEIS. If a compelling need can be shown for additional disposal capacity
prior to completing sitewide decisions, DOE may, at a later time, propose a separate NEPA review to address those needs.

Hazardous Waste Treatment Facility and Mixed Waste Receiving and Storage Facility, TA&hyph;63. Proposal to construct
and operate two waste management facilities to repackage, stage and treat hazardous and mixed wastes which cannot
be placed in land disposal areas. The two facilities would be connected actions because they would be located close
together and they support each other; therefore the NEPA review has been combined. DOE has an initial milestone of
01/30/95 for completing the detailed design for the proposed Hazardous Waste Treatment Facility to comply with its
Federal Facility Compliance Agreement with the EPA; the NEPA review must be completed prior to beginning the detailed
design. The proposal includes using small-scale, self-contained portable ``skids'' to treat the waste

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
EM 04/26/91 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
Discussion: The Hazardous Waste Treatment Facility is needed for on-site waste management and to help DOE meet compliance
milestones regarding legacy waste. Delays in completing design and initiating construction could jeopardize meeting
the Agreement. If this project is deferred until the SWEIS, the compliance milestone could not be met. The Mixed Waste
Receiving and Storage Facility, while not tied to a specific compliance milestone, would assist DOE in meeting near-term
site waste management goals. Although the NEPA determination was to analyze these two facilities together, the cumulative
impacts of waste disposal operations would be analyzed in the SWEIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial Recommendation: Proceed with EA.

High Explosives Wastewater Treatment Facility, TA&hyph;16. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposal to construct and operate a wastewater treatment facility to treat wastewater containing trace amounts
of high explosives waste. The project would include constructing a delivery pipeline and decontamination and demolition
of an existing treatment facility. The project would minimize wastewater generation by eliminating 99 percent of
current wastewater flows through a combination of wastewater elimination, recycle, and reuse. It would reduce the
number of industrial wastewater outfalls from the 17 currently in use to 1. On 6/15/94 the EPA issued an Administrative
Order to LANL requiring compliance with Clean Water Act permitting requirements. DOE has a milestone of 10/97 to start
construction under its Federal Facility Compliance Agreement with the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
EM 06/29/92 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
Discussion: DOE needs to address water pollution compliance independent of SWEIS analysis. If construction is not
started by 10/97, DOE would not meet its compliance milestone and LANL would not meet the Administrative Order. To
start construction by that date, design work must be completed; detailed design could not start until the NEPA review
is completed. If the design work was deferred until after sitewide decisions, the schedule could not be met. The SWEIS
is expected to result in a sitewide waste management strategy; this facility could be important to that strategy.
Work to minimize in-plant waste and eliminate some wastewater outfalls would not influence, nor be influenced by,
sitewide decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial Recommendation: DOE makes no recommendation at this time regarding proceeding with this NEPA review.

Mixed Waste Disposal Facility, TA&hyph;67. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed facility to treat and dispose of mixed (radioactive and hazardous) waste generated at LANL. The entire project
would consist of up to 11 waste disposal cells and would hold up to 475,000 cubic yards of waste generated by environmental
restoration work at LANL
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
EM 07/13/93 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
Discussion: The EPA issued a Hazardous and Solid Waste Act Permit to LANL that requires LANL provide a list of solid
waste management units. The workplans for cleanup of the units, to be submitted prior to the investigation phase,
will contain schedules for completing the site investigation work. These schedules, once accepted by the EPA, will
be legally enforceable milestones under the conditions described in the Permit. In addition, it is expected that
voluntary corrective actions will be undertaken to remediate a majority of the sites during the site investigation
phase. The facility would provide the capacity to safely treat and dispose of the waste expected to be generated by
this program. The NEPA review must be completed before detailed designs are started. If the detailed design phase
is delayed until the SWEIS is completed, the DOE and LANL will not be able to meet the cleanup schedules. In 1993, DOE
conducted nine public meetings on the scope of the NEPA review of the entire project to allow the project milestones
to be met while the SWEIS is under preparation. Under the Environmental Assessment currently being prepared, the
facility would be constructed for the disposal of environmental restoration waste only. Discussions concerning
the potential disposal of legacy and operational mixed waste will be part of the SWEIS environmental restoration
and waste management strategy. The total projected volume of legacy and operational mixed waste would be less than
one percent of the projected total annual waste volumes. Initial Recommendation: DOE makes no recommendation at
this time regarding proceeding with this NEPA review. However, DOE proposes to proceed with the EA review for the environmental
restoration waste only and make the draft EA available to stakeholders to assist in the decision making process. Include
in the SWEIS the analysis of the disposal of legacy and operational mixed wastes.

Laundry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE is considering proposing to locate, construct, and operate an on-site facility to launder anti-contamination
clothing which may potentially be contaminated with radioactive materials from ongoing activities 
<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
DP 
<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
Currently, laundry is done in an off-site facility. It is possible that an on-site facility would be more efficient.
This is a small-scale project that would not influence, nor be influenced by, sitewide decisions. If decisions on
the laundry are deferred until after the SWEIS, DOE would continue to use an off-site contract laundry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Receipt and Storage of Nuclear Material for Criticality Experiment, TA&hyph;18. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE is considering proposing to ship nuclear material from various DOE sites to the Los Alamos Critical Experiments
Facility (LACEF), and store the material at that facility, until it is needed for criticality experiments or training
exercises. The experiments or training exercises would be covered by separate NEPA review. DOE currently has about
3,000 unirradiated low-enriched uranium nuclear reactor fuel rods at its Hanford Plant, Richland, Washington;
about 30 kilograms of unirradiated high-enriched uranium particle bed fuel at its Sandia National Laboratory, Albuquerque,
New Mexico; and about 250 kilograms of high-enriched uranium reactor fuel from the critical mass assembly at its Health
Physics Research Reactor, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The LACEF is the only remaining DOE
facility where criticality experiments are routinely conducted. In response to the 1993 Defense Nuclear Facilities
Safety Board recommendation regarding critical facilities infrastructure, DOE is considering consolidating
unique critical mass assemblies at the LACEF in order to continue to reliably analyze the criticality of nuclear systems

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
DP 
<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
The DOE sites listed no longer have any programmatic need for this material. Hanford can no longer provide long-term
storage due to clean-up operations now going on; if not moved off-site, it will be disposed of by burial at Hanford.
The Sandia material is unique and was developed at significant taxpayer expense; the Department of Defense might
fund shipment to LANL if it can be accomplished in the near-term. The Oak Ridge material has been used as an important
calibrated radiation source for accident simulation and radiation dosimetry; this device is the only one in this
country which has been characterized to make the dosimetric measurements essential for analyzing accident conditions
and other radiation experiments. LANL has an ongoing criticality experiments and safety training program and can
make use of this material in the future. If decisions on receiving and storing the material are deferred until the SWEIS,
it is possible that storage, shipping or funding constraints would make the material unavailable to LANL. Decisions
regarding the long-term use of the LACEF would be made in the SWEIS as part of the sitewide nuclear materials storage
and handling strategy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hazardous, Low Level Radioactive, and Mixed Waste Treatment Skids. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE uses portable, self-contained treatment units, or ``skids,'' to treat hazardous, low-level radioactive, and
mixed (radioactive and hazardous) waste. In addition to the ``skids'' specifically proposed as part of the Hazardous
Waste Treatment Facility, DOE may require additional ``skids'' to treat waste at various locations at LANL 
<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
EM 
<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
The current Hazardous Waste Treatment Facility and Mixed Waste Receiving and Storage Facility proposal includes
the use of certain ``skids'' specifically for treating waste at these facilities. DOE may need to use additional ``skids''
to treat on-site waste at various locations at LANL in order to meet the schedule for DOE's Federal Facility Compliance
Agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency. The additional ``skids'' would be designed, constructed,
and possibly operated prior to completion of the proposed Hazardous Waste Treatment Facility and prior to completion
of the SWEIS to meet the Agreement schedule. If the project is deferred until the SWEIS, the ``skids'' could not be designed,
constructed or used in the near-term.

Replacement Waste Compactor TA&hyph;54. DOE is considering proposing to replace an existing 50-ton waste compactor
at the low-level radioactive waste management area at Area G, TA&hyph;54, with a 200-ton compactor in a new building
adjacent to the existing facility. Initially, DOE considered including the analysis of this proposal with the NEPA
review for the proposal to expand Area G, TA&hyph;54; however, the NEPA determination for that proposal did not include
the compactor. The existing compactor is not operating. The proposed replacement compactor would increase the operating
life of the existing waste disposal area by increasing the efficiency of waste minimization practices, including
reducing the volume of waste for disposal and eliminating void spaces between waste containers. This, in turn, would
postpone the need to expand the existing waste site 
<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
EM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
Discussion: This is a small-scale project which would increase operational efficiency and reduce waste volume.
This, in turn, would extend the useful life of the existing disposal area. If installing the proposed compactor is
deferred until the SWEIS, the existing compactor would not be replaced and inefficient waste disposal practices
would continue in the existing area. A decision to install and operate the compactor would not influence, nor be influenced
by, sitewide decisions.

Radioisotope Heat Source Fabrication, CMR, TA&hyph;3 and TA&hyph;55 (Revision to 1991 EA). Plutonium-238 is used
as a long-term, reliable source of heat that is converted to electricity to power spacecraft. In 1991 DOE completed
an EA for the Cassini mission and the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF); CRAF was later canceled. The work at LANL
to support the Cassini mission is ongoing. The project to build more units for other uses may be extended at LANL 
<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
NE 
<!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->
The 1991 EA analyzed using LANL facilities at TA&hyph;55 to support radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG)
work for the space mission. The proposal may be revised to allow for RTG work for other missions, beyond the timeframe
included in the 1991 EA, and possibly using facilities at the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building in addition
to TA&hyph;55. If so, the 1991 EA would be revised to provide the NEPA review for the revised mission. If the revised
NEPA review were to proceed, DOE could make early decisions on whether to use LANL facilities for the additional RTG
work. This would be necessary if, prior to completing sitewide decisions, DOE needed to determine where the additional
RTG work would be done in the near-term in order to meet mission schedules. If the project is deferred until the SWEIS,
it is possible that DOE may not be able to deliver heat sources to meet mission needs. Any future long-term uses of LANL
facilities for such missions, and long-term strategy for storing and handling plutonium-238, will be included in
the SWEIS.

), the Council on Environmental Quality regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts
1500&hyph;1508), and the Department's Implementing Procedures (10 CFR Part 1021), the DOE announces its intent
to prepare a Site-wide Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Nevada Test Site and other off-site test locations
within the State of Nevada. The purpose of this Notice is to invite the participation of Federal, state, and local agencies,
affected Indian tribes, and other interested persons in the process that DOE will follow to comply with NEPA, and to

In order to meet present and potential future mission responsibilities at the Nevada Test Site, the Department proposes
to evaluate resource management alternatives for the Nevada Test Site which would support current and future defense
related missions, research and development, waste management, environmental restoration, infrastructure maintenance,
and facility upgrades and alternative uses over the next 5&hyph;10 years. This Site-wide EIS will address numerous
issues, including, without limitation: (1) environmental restoration and other Departmental activities at the
Nevada Test Site and at off-site locations in the State of Nevada where DOE conducted nuclear experiments, which include
the Project Shoal Area, Central Nevada Test Area, Tonopah Test Range, and portions of the Nellis Air Force Range; and
(2) transportation and disposal of wastes, which are generated on and off-site of the Nevada Test Site.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department's responsibilities are mandated by statute, Presidential direction, and Congressional authorization
and appropriation. Other activities may be directed by regulatory mandates identified in compliance agreements
or orders or other enforceable documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nevada Test Site occupies 1,350 square miles in southern Nevada, and is located approximately 65 miles northwest
of Las Vegas. The Nevada Test Site is bordered to the north, west, and east by the Nellis Air Force Range, and on the south
by Bureau of Land Management-administered lands. To the east, the Nevada Test Site shares a nearly contiguous border
with lands managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the Desert Game Range. The western half of the Game Range
is also used by the U.S. Air Force, which shares a contiguous boundary with the Nevada Test Site. The Nevada Test Site
is a remote, secure facility for conducting underground testing of nuclear weapons and for evaluating the effects
of nuclear weapons on military communications systems, electronics, satellites, sensors, and other materials.
Since the signing of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty in 1974, it has been the only site used by the United States for underground
nuclear weapons testing. In September 1992, Congress, within the framework of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, imposed
a nine-month moratorium on underground nuclear testing. President Clinton extended the moratorium in July 1993
for an additional 15 months and subsequently, in March 1994, extended the moratorium through September 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing land use on the Nevada Test Site falls into four general categories: Testing Areas; Reserved Areas; Industrial/Research
Areas; and Waste Management Areas. Most of the work on the Nevada Test Site has been and continues to be related to national
defense, with a growing emphasis on environmental restoration and waste management programs. Changing world conditions
and national policies have reduced the need for testing programs, and other DOE and non-DOE activities are now being
considered for siting at the Nevada Test Site. A map showing existing land use at the Nevada Test Site and the locations
of the off-site tests is available on request to Donald R. Elle at the above address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nevada Test Site is a unique facility. It is a large remote area with tightly controlled access, with a substantial
infrastructure, and the capability to conduct tests with hazardous and radioactive materials. The southwest region
of the Nevada Test Site provides support for nonweapons and nonnuclear weapons programs and for short term activities
such as the nuclear weapons accident exercises conducted by the Nuclear Emergency Search Team. In 1993, DOE designated
the Nevada Test Site as a National Environmental Research Park. The Research Park is available for use by the scientific
community as an outdoor laboratory for research on the effects of human activities on the desert ecosystem. Land not
used for mission or other purposes has been designated as reserved areas, available for future development. The northern
part of the Nevada Test Site is reserved as an underground nuclear weapons testing area. Nuclear test locations are
at Yucca Flat, Pahute Mesa, Rainer Mesa, and Buckboard Mesa. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste management activities have been ongoing at the Nevada Test Site since 1952. For ease of identification, the
Nevada Test Site has been divided into numbered geographic ``Areas''. Waste Operations are conducted in several
areas. Sanitary and solid waste are disposed of in Areas 23 and 9. Hydrocarbon-contaminated soils are disposed of
in a permitted landfill in Area 6. Radioactive waste management sites are located in Areas 3 and 5. Area 5 is also the
location of a 90-day hazardous waste accumulation site. Waste streams continue to be generated, stored, and disposed
of at the Nevada Test Site. Radioactive wastes are also shipped to the Nevada Test Site for disposal from other Department
and Department-authorized sites. Waste management operations at Nevada Test Site include: Accumulation of hazardous
waste; disposal of low-level radioactive waste including some classified waste; management of mixed radioactive
and hazardous waste; storage of mixed transuranic waste; and disposal of sanitary waste.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mixed transuranic waste is stored on a pad at Area 5 under conditions set forth in the July 1992 Settlement Agreement
between DOE and the State of Nevada. A consent agreement signed by DOE and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection
in 1994 allows storage at Area 5 of mixed waste generated during characterization activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through 1994 there have been 1054 nuclear tests conducted by the United States, 928 of which were conducted on the Nevada
Test Site. Defense research and weapons test verification activities were conducted at other test locations in Nevada.
Nuclear devices were detonated underground at the Project Shoal Area and the Central Nevada Test Area. From 1957 to
1963, many safety tests using special nuclear materials and chemical explosives were conducted at sites on the Nevada
Test Site, Nellis Air Force Range, and Tonopah Test Range to test the safety of nuclear weapons in accident situations.
These tests have resulted in the release of radioactive materials and surface contamination over large areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Yucca Mountain site is located on the southwestern boundary of the Nevada Test Site. In the 1987 amendments to the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), Congress directed DOE to characterize the Yucca Mountain site for possible development
of a geologic repository for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high level nuclear waste. Prior to passage of the 1987
amendments, DOE had prepared an environmental assessment (EA) which included an analysis of the effects of site characterization
activities at Yucca Mountain (DOE/RW&hyph;0073, May 1986). If DOE ultimately recommends approval of the Yucca Mountain
site to the President, that recommendation must be accompanied by an EIS prepared under the specific provisions of
the NWPA. All activities regarding the characterization of the Yucca Mountain site, and any eventual construction
and operation of a repository, including environmental review, are regulated by the process prescribed in the NWPA.
Therefore, the Nevada Test Site EIS will address ongoing Yucca Mountain site characterization activities only as
they relate to the cumulative impacts of activities on the Nevada Test Site during the period covered by the EIS, using
the Yucca Mountain EA as a baseline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management surround the Nevada Test Site and Nellis Air Force Range
on all sides. The Tonopah Test Range is located in the northwestern portion of the Nellis Air Force Range, and is operated
by Sandia National Laboratories, under contract with the DOE Albuquerque Operations Office, and through a Memorandum
of Agreement between the Department of Energy's Albuquerque and Nevada Operations Offices. The Central Nevada Test
Area is located approximately 60 miles east of Tonopah between Warm Springs and Currant (approximately 160 miles
north of Las Vegas), and the Project Shoal Area is located approximately 30 miles southeast of Fallon (approximately
90 miles east of Reno and 285 miles northwest of Las Vegas). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nevada Test Site, Nellis Air Force Range, and Tonopah Test Range each have restricted-access areas that are not
open to the public for purposes such as agriculture, mining, land disposal of wastes, or mineral leasing. With the
exception of very limited special hunting access to a portion of the Nellis Air Force Range, these sites are not open
for recreational use. The Project Shoal Area and the Central Nevada Test Area are not restricted-access areas and
are open for general public uses including grazing and recreation, but not to mining. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public roads link the Project Shoal Area and the Central Nevada Test Area with the Nevada Test Site and these may be used
to ship wastes to the Nevada Test Site. In addition, some public roads may be used to transport waste from Nellis Air
Force Range and Tonopah Test Range to the waste management locations on the Nevada Test Site or elsewhere. Public roads
are also used to ship low level radioactive waste from other DOE sites to the Nevada Test Site and to ship hazardous waste
from the Nevada Test Site to permitted disposal facilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Preliminary Identification of Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is to develop a resource management plan for the Nevada Test Site. The Department of Energy needs
a site resource management plan that would allow it to continue its missions in a way that minimizes or avoids environmental
impacts. A preliminary set of resource management alternatives for evaluation in the EIS has been identified below.
The final set of alternatives and issues to be considered in the EIS will reflect consideration of the public input
received during the scoping period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
No Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the no action alternative, existing missions and operations would continue at the present level. Environmental
restoration activities would continue at the Nevada Test Site and at off-site test locations within the State of Nevada.
Off-site test location activities would be consistent with the applicable land use plans of the controlling agency.
This alternative includes the potential to resume underground nuclear testing and conducting other nuclear weapon
related experiments at the Nevada Test Site. Expanded use of the Nevada Test Site for defense-related experiments,
alternative energy source technology development, non- or counter-proliferation research and development and
environmental technology development would not be pursued. Waste management activities would continue to support
existing DOE missions and operations in the same manner and degree as at present and in the recent past. Continuing
activities at the Area 3 and 5 radioactive waste management sites include: the disposal of low-level radioactive
wastes generated from both on-site activities and off-site DOE and Department of Defense facilities such as the Fernald
Field Office near Cincinnati, Ohio; the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (formerly the Rocky Flats Plant),
Golden, Colorado; the Amarillo Area Office (Pantex), Amarillo, Texas; and the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Aberdeen,
Maryland. Other continuing activities include storage of transuranic and other wastes, accumulation of hazardous
wastes prior to off-site shipment for disposal, and disposal of on-site generated mixed waste that meets the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) land disposal restriction criteria. Groundwater characterization would
continue with the associated waste management activities. This alternative is intended to encompass current operations,
including waste management and technology development operations without the improvements or expansion which
would occur under the expanded use alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Expanded Use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this alternative, maximum use would be made of the Nevada Test Site in support of national programs of both a defense
and non-defense nature. National Defense activities could include a resumption of underground nuclear testing
with the required support activities; conducting other nuclear weapons related experiments; the construction
and operation of various types of simulator facilities and other experimental test facilities; tritium production;
plutonium storage and disposition; nuclear weapons storage and disassembly and similar activities that could be
best conducted at a remote site. The site could also be used for various exercises and technology development aimed
at countering nuclear terrorism or proliferation activities. Non-defense programs could include the study of alternative
energy sources including the construction and operation of various solar energy facilities that would demonstrate
the effectiveness of the technologies; expanded use of the Liquefied Gaseous Fuels Spill Test Facility; and increased
use of the site as an Environmental Research Park.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This alternative would include continuation of on-going waste management activities, planned waste management
and environmental restoration activities, and enhanced usage of the Site for waste management activities. In addition
to on-going activities, planned waste management activities proposed for the Area 5 radioactive waste management
site include construction and operation of: certification facilities for various types of waste, expanded mixed
waste disposal facilities for on- and off-site generated mixed waste, increased capacity for hazardous and mixed
waste storage, waste treatment facilities, closure barriers or caps, and infrastructure improvements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced usage would include, for example, options to utilize the Nevada Test Site as specified in other DOE and Department
of Defense NEPA documents (such as the Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic EIS which, among
other things, addresses a programmatic alternative under which all DOE low-level radioactive wastes would be disposed
of at the Nevada Test Site); regional treatment of mixed waste in accordance with the Federal Facility Compliance
Act; and disposal of mixed and transuranic wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department will consider other resource management alternatives, i.e., variations of the no action alternative
that would involve no new projects or a phased reduction in current operations, and no shipments or reduced shipments
of off-site waste to the Nevada Test Site. The Department invites public comment on the above, and suggestions regarding
other resource management alternatives that should be considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following is a list of forthcoming NEPA documentation related to this EIS that have the potential for affecting
its scope by inclusion of the Nevada Test Site as an alternative site for the action being considered: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Reconfiguration Programmatic EIS_On July 23, 1993, the Department published a revised Notice of Intent (56 FR
39528) to prepare a Programmatic EIS for reconfiguration of its nuclear weapons complex due to nuclear weapons stockpile
reductions. The Department currently is considering how the scope of this Programmatic EIS should be revised further
to reflect more recent budget and stockpile reduction decisions. The Nevada Test Site is a potential alternative
site in this EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Fissile Materials Storage and Disposition Programmatic EIS will address the long-term storage of all fissile
nuclear materials and disposition of surplus fissile nuclear materials. The Notice of Intent announcing the preparation
of this EIS was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 31985), on June 21, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic EIS will address waste management alternatives
for existing and proposed actions and DOE complex-wide issues associated with long-term waste management policies
and practices. In this Programmatic EIS, the Department is evaluating the Nevada Test Site as an alternative site
for managing DOE wastes. An Implementation Plan for this Programmatic EIS was issued in January 1994. The final Programmatic
EIS is scheduled to be issued in 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Spent Nuclear Fuel Management and Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Restoration and
Waste Management Programs EIS analyzes the potential environmental consequences of alternatives to the transportation,
receipt, processing, and storage of the Department's spent nuclear fuel. The Nevada Test Site is being evaluated
as a potential spent nuclear fuel management site in this analysis, but the Department has stated that the Nevada Test
Site is not the preferred alternative; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Proposed Policy for the Acceptance of United States Origin Foreign Research Reactor Spent Nuclear Fuel EIS
will address the potential environmental impacts of the proposed policy renewal and its implementation. Under a
renewed policy, the United States could accept up to 15,000 foreign research reactor spent fuel elements over a 10
to 15 year period. The Nevada Test Site is a potential storage site in this EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Continued Operation of the Pantex Plant and Associated Storage of Nuclear Weapons Components EIS will address
the potential environmental impacts of the continued operation of the Pantex Plant. These include near- to mid-term
foreseeable activities and the nuclear component storage activities at other Department sites associated with
nuclear weapon disassembly at the Pantex Plant, over the next 5 to 10 years. The Nevada Test Site is being considered
as a potential site under the relocation of operations alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The environmental restoration program at the Fernald Environmental Management project is divided into five
operable units. For each operable unit, a feasibility study/proposed plan is being prepared to provide a detailed
evaluation of the leading remedial alternative for each area of contamination. Nevada Test Site may be identified
as the preferred candidate disposal site for portions of the low level waste generated during cleanup activities
for each operable unit. The current schedule for the Department to submit the feasibility study/proposed plans to
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for approval is as follows: Operable Unit 1 (Waste Pits), submitted July
1994; Operable Unit 2 (Solid Waste Units), to be submitted August 1994; Operable Unit 3 (Production Area), to be submitted
November 1996; Operable Unit 4 (Silos), submitted December 1993; and Operable Unit 5 (Environmental Media), to be
submitted in February 1995.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5) it is making a discretionary financial
assistance award based on the criteria set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(B) under Grant Number DE-FG01&hyph;94CE41130
to the Natural Resources Defense Council. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount of $100,000
by the Department of Energy for the purpose of developing a pollution prevention program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(H) that a noncompetitive award
based on a proposal, which is meritorious based on the Department's general evaluation, is justified. The activity
is being conducted by the applicant using its own resources or those donated or provide by third parties, however,
DOE support of that activity would enhance the public benefits to be derived and DOE knows of no other entity which is
conducting or is planning to conduct such activity. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount
of $100,000. The proposed project is fully compatible with the mission of the Office of Industrial Technology, the
sponsoring office. This project will allow DOE to develop a regulatory framework, implemented on a pilot basis, that
will prevent pollution and reduce emissions generated in the industrial sector; and it provides an opportunity to
make further progress toward environmental protection, foster industrial innovation to prevent pollution, and
increase the effectiveness of environmental programs.

Take notice that on July 19, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural) filed revised tariff sheets to
be a part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1 (Tariff), to be effective September 1, 1994. Natural's filing
was originally docketed in Docket No. RS92&hyph;45&hyph;018, and is being redocketed as Docket No. RP94&hyph;346&hyph;004.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural states that the purpose of the filing is to implement the Stipulation and Agreement on Gas Supply Realignment
Cost Recovery between Natural and the Natural Customer Group as filed on February 1, 1994, and approved by the Commission
with modifications on May 12, 1994. The tariff sheets modify two areas of the General Terms and Conditions of Natural's
Tariff: Section 22, relating to rollover rights and Section 38, relating to recovery of gas supply realignment costs.
Natural requests waiver of the Commission's Regulations, including the requirements to &sect;154.63, to the extent
necessary to permit the tariff sheets to become effective September 1, 1994. Natural states that copies of its filing
were served on all parties to this proceeding, jurisdictional transportation customers and interested state regulatory
agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest this filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, in accordance with &sect;&sect;385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before August 19, 1994. Protests will be considered
by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties
to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on
file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is redocketing the material in the record related to the instant compliance filing into Docket No.
RP94&hyph;346&hyph;000. This material is listed in the Appendix to this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All parties in Natural's restructuring proceedings in Docket No. RS92&hyph;45&hyph;000 are automatically parties
to the redocketed proceedings and need not file motions to intervene. However, due to the large number of parties on
the service list in Natural's restructuring proceeding, the Secretary is establishing a restricted service list
for the redocketed filings in accordance with &sect;385.2010 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. The restricted
service list will be the only service list maintained with respect to the redocketed filings. Parties wishing to be
included on the restricted service list must submit to the Secretary of the Commission the names and addresses of the
persons designated for service on or before August 19, 1994.

Take notice that on August 1, 1994, NorAm Gas Transmission Company (NGT) tendered for filing proposed changes in its
FERC Gas Tariff, by filing Fourth Revised Volume No. 1. NGT states that the proposed tariff sheets reflect an annual
overall jurisdictional rate increase of approximately $42.5 million, described on Statement G, based on the twelve
month period ending April 30, 1994, as adjusted. NGT also states that the filing reflects rate design changes required
to implement Commission policy, as set forth in the Commission's Rate Design Policy Statement and in Order No. 636.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGT states that in this filing it establishes additive zone rates for its throughway system and a market lateral surcharge
to be charged to shippers with delivery points on market laterals. NGT establishes in this filing a new pooling rate
schedule that establishes a pooling service that complements the zone rate proposal. NGT proposes in this filing
to recover in its rates the costs associated with Line AC, and requests removal of the ``at-risk'' condition imposed
with respect to Line AC. The filing also includes certain miscellaneous tariff changes including modifications
to Rate Schedules FSS and NNTS, and to NGT's imbalance resolution mechanism.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGT states that copies of the filing were served on NGT's jurisdictional customers and interested state public service
commissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rules
211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 18 CFR 385.214). All such motions
or protests should be filed on or before August 11, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing
to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available
for public inspection.

Motions to intervene in the above-captioned proceeding were due on July 1, 1994. A motion to intervene out of time was
filed on July 12, 1994, by El Paso Natural Gas Company. No answers in opposition to the motion were filed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The movant appears to have a legitimate interest under the law that is not adequately represented by other parties.
Granting the intervention will not cause a delay or prejudice any other party. It is in the public interest to allow
the movant to appear in proceeding. Accordingly, good cause exists for granting the late intervention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to &sect;375.302 of the Commission's Regulations (18 CFR 375.302 (1988)), the movant is permitted to intervene
in this proceeding subject to the Commission's rules and regulations under the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;717&hyph;717(w).
Participation of the late intervenor shall be limited to matters set forth in its motion to intervene. The admission
of the late intervenor shall not be construed as recognition by the Commission that the intervenor might be aggrieved
by any order entered in this proceeding.

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), EPA is given the responsibility of regulating
the manufacture, sale, and use of pesticides to ensure that there are no unreasonable adverse effects to human health
or the environment as a result of the use of a pesticide. Regulatory decisions that carry out this responsibility are
reached by evaluating the risks and benefits associated with the pesticide's use, as well as with alternative pesticides
and pest control methods. This process determines what degree of risk is reasonable while taking into consideration
the economic and social benefits gained from the pesticide, ensuring that the risks do not outweigh the benefits.
The Agency has several mechanisms in place to effect this balance if the results of the risk and benefit evaluations
indicate that unreasonable adverse effects are likely from the pesticide's use and that regulatory action is warranted.
Each of these mechanisms has advantages and disadvantages that range from the length of time required to reach the
regulatory decision, the amount of Agency resources necessary, to the degree the public is involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the Agency has reason to believe that the use of a currently registered pesticide may result in unreasonable adverse
effects to human health or the environment, a structured review of the pesticide of concern may be carried out through
the formal Special Review process. The risk criteria initiating this review process and the regulations governing
it are set forth in 40 CFR part 154. The formal Special Review process as set forth in these regulations provides the
opportunity for public input through the solicitation of comments at two distinct stages of the review: The formal
announcement of initiation of the Special Review (Position Document 1) and the announcement of the Agency's preliminary
decision (Position Document 2/3). The Agency considers all significant comments before reaching a final decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formal Special Review process can prove to be resource intensive and time-consuming due in part to its discrete
stages and the opportunities provided for public comment. The Government Accounting Office (GAO) issued reports
in 1980 and 1986 concluding that the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) was not completing reviews of potentially
hazardous pesticides in a timely manner. Similarly, in 1984, the House of Representatives Committee on Government
Operations found that the Special Review process was not quickly reaching decisions on potential risks that were
found to be associated with certain pesticide uses. Recently, the Agency's Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducted
an audit of the Special Review process and presented its results in a final report dated July 22, 1993. This report,
while critical of some aspects of the Special Review process and the time involved in completing the reviews, also
raised concerns about using negotiated settlement agreements to achieve pesticide risk reduction rather than initiating
new Special Reviews. The OIG concluded that negotiated settlement agreements do achieve risk reduction more quickly
than the formal Special Review process, but was concerned that negotiated decisions were made between the Agency
and pesticide registrants at the expense of public involvement. The report also reflected concern that the Agency
does not notify the public of risk concerns while a decision is being made whether or not to formally initiate a Special
Review; i.e., during the pre-Special Review (that period of time after a preliminary (Grassley-Allen) notification
is sent to the registrants but before issuance of the public announcement (Position Document 1) initiating the Special
Review). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other mechanisms are available to achieve pesticide risk reduction at a more accelerated pace than is afforded through
a normal Special Review. They include the issuance of a Position Document 1/2/3 which combines the first two position
documents issued in the formal Special Review process into one. This is used when enough information is available
at the outset of a Special Review to fully assess the risks and benefits and reach a proposed decision. Additional mechanisms
include issuing Notices of Intent to Cancel (NOIC), Suspension Orders, or Emergency Suspension Orders as provided
under FIFRA section 6. These mechanisms can be used to remove pesticides from the market that pose significant risks
or imminent hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Agency has used all of these different means in the past to effect pesticide risk reduction, recently,
negotiated settlement agreements have been used more and more frequently. Through the process of negotiation, the
Agency and the registrant(s) reach a mutual agreement that legally commits the registrant(s) to specific measures
that will reduce potential risks associated with a pesticide's use. Such measures typically include modifying the
terms of registration by cancellation of uses, changing use patterns, changing application methods, or altering
the manufacturing formula. The same scientific principles and weight-of-evidence information that govern the
decisions made during a formal Special Review also apply to negotiated settlements; that is, carefully analyzing
risks, benefits, and alternative pest control methods to ensure that the risk reduction measures desired will not
result in risks that outweigh the benefits or that risks are reduced to the greatest extent practical while data are
being generated to better understand the risks associated with the use of the pesticide. The agreements also make
every effort to ensure that a pesticide use will not shift to an alternative pesticide or pest control method of equal
or greater risk concern or result in the trading of one risk for another. By using the same analyses as those used in a
formal Special Review, the public and the environment should be afforded the same level of protection in a more timely
fashion. The main difference is that the Special Review process formally provides opportunities for public involvement
before reaching risk reduction decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In all negotiated settlement agreements, the Agency reserves the right to take additional regulatory action if evidence
arises that warrants it. Similarly, the Agency can remove restrictions if additional data are reviewed later that
indicate risks are of less concern than previously thought. Negotiated settlement agreements, however, should
not be viewed as an exclusive mechanism to achieve a final risk reduction decision. They may be used to reach an ultimate
goal of the Agency such as use cancellation or use reduction, or they may be used as an interim measure to reduce risks
while additional data are being generated, or during any stage of an ongoing Special Review prior to the Agency making
its final decision. Although the Agency has been criticized for neglecting to include affected constituency groups
(e.g., users and public interest groups) in risk reduction decisions made through negotiated settlement agreements
and for not making the general public aware of risk concerns for pesticides being considered for the formal Special
Review process, several steps already have been taken to open up the decision-making process to the public whenever
possible. Specific examples of how the Agency has provided for public involvement in recent negotiated settlement
agreements are provided below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Parathion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In September 1991, due to concerns of acute poisonings to workers exposed to parathion, the Agency reached a negotiated
settlement agreement with the registrants whereby all but nine uses of parathion were voluntarily canceled. The
Agency held public hearings in December 1992 to solicit public involvement and gain additional information on the
risks and benefits of the remaining nine uses. These hearings were held in Amarillo, Texas; Lincoln, Nebraska; and
Baltimore, Maryland and were announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to encourage all interested parties to participate. The Agency also polled State and regional offices for advice
and input.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2,4-D
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In June 1992, in an effort to reduce the amount of exposure to persons applying 2,4-D and therefore reduce potential
risks, the Agency met with the 2,4-D Task Force and requested that they include end-user input in the development of
such measures. Also, through meetings and telephone conversations, the Agency actively included distributors
and end-users to help develop effective and fair exposure reduction measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Granular carbofuran
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. According to 40 CFR 154.35(c), the Agency must publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to modify an earlier determination in a way that might increase a risk that was the subject of a Special Review. During
the final stages of the Special Review of granular carbofuran, the Agency negotiated a settlement agreement with
the registrants to phase out most uses. In order to extend the registration for the use of carbofuran on rice, the Agency
formally requested public comment as required under 40 CFR 154.35(c). The denial of extensions of registrations
for two other uses, corn and sorghum, did not require such request for comment. The Agency, however, announced in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its decision to deny extension of the registration for corn and sorghum uses and allowed the opportunity for comment
from affected individuals or groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Azinphos-methyl
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Due to its concerns regarding the hazards azinphos-methyl posed to fish from use on sugarcane in Louisiana, the Agency
reached an agreement with the registrants to amend their registrations in April 1993. The agreement, including prescription
use, was the result of a cooperative effort between the Agency, Louisiana State officials, and the pesticide registrants.
Through the use of public workshops held in Louisiana to collect additional information about azinphos-methyl use
and alternative pesticides, the Agency advanced the use of negotiated settlement agreements by actively soliciting
public input that contributed to the decision-making process. The workshops were announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and participation of all interested parties was encouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, in order to keep the public better informed of its risk concerns, the Agency has, as a matter of general
policy, made available to the public those dockets established for pre-Special Review chemicals which have had private
notifications issued for 6 months but have not yet had a Special Review formally initiated. The Agency will continue
this procedure. In addition, the Agency will announce those Special Review and pre-Special Review chemicals for
which a public docket is available in the January edition of the quarterly Pesticide Reregistration Progress Report.
Also, OPP's ``Status of Pesticides in Reregistration and Special Review'' (Rainbow Report) provides a comprehensive
status of all chemicals currently undergoing reregistration and Special Review. To receive copies of these reports
or to be added to the mailing list, please write or fax the following address: U.S. EPA, NCEPI, P.O. Box 42419, Cincinnati,
OH 45242&hyph;0419, Telephone (513) 891&hyph;6561, Fax (513) 891&hyph;6685. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mechanisms that may provide opportunities for public input that the Agency has not frequently used but will consider
in the future, include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Holding public hearings provided under FIFRA section 6(b)(2). This section of FIFRA allows the Agency to issue
a notice to hold hearings to determine whether or not a registration should be canceled or its classification changed
and ``such notice shall be sent to the registrant and made public.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Requesting additional information and views from interested parties, particularly users, user associations
and public interest groups, through solicitation of comments and notification of public hearings provided under
FIFRA section 21(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Publishing the Agency's risk concern and proposed regulatory action for a particular pesticide in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, soliciting public comment. In fact, the Administrative Conference of the United States recently adopted Recommendation
93-5 concerning Procedures for Regulation of Pesticides. One of its final recommendations was that EPA provide public
notification of pesticide risk concerns once negotiations begin, publicize the availability of a public docket,
the proposed settlement and establish a ``compliance docket'' to address the effectiveness of the mitigated measures
formally adopted. This recommendation was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4675).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is committed to the responsibilities set forth in FIFRA and views pesticide risk reduction as an evolving
process where flexibility is a key element for successfully reducing risk posed by pesticides. For this reason, the
Agency feels that having the option of several mechanisms to achieve risk reduction provides for effective strategies
that suit the varied situations that may present themselves. Each of the options lends itself to particular circumstances
when other risk reduction mechanisms would prove less effective; therefore, the Agency will continue to consider
all of the options available to promote safe and beneficial pesticide use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. General Policy to Provide for Public Involvement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the Agency's responsibility to investigate all registered pesticides thought to cause unreasonable adverse
effects to human health or the environment and to reduce those risks to levels that the Agency feels are reasonable
while considering the benefits of use. It is the Agency's goal to reduce significant risks as quickly as possible,
considering all aspects of the chemical and utilizing the most efficient and effective regulatory option(s) available.
In cases where negotiated settlement agreements are appropriate, it will be the Agency's general policy to provide
opportunity for public involvement, whenever possible. The Agency understands the importance of public input in
reaching regulatory decisions, especially input from grower and user groups closely associated with a particular
pesticide of concern who may provide useful risk and benefit information that the Agency would find helpful in reducing
risks while not significantly reducing the efficacy of the pesticide. Other critical information that could be obtained
through public input and that the Agency views as essential to making effective decisions includes human or environmental
incident data held by end-user groups or other environmental organizations. The Agency will continue to consider
those mechanisms used in the past to encourage public involvement and will maintain an openness for innovative approaches
that will allow for greater public involvement in negotiated settlement agreements.

IV. Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is requesting comments and suggestions on its existing or proposed means to acquire public input that can
be used to enhance our risk/benefit analyses and the resulting regulatory decisions. The Agency is also seeking comment
on the advantages and disadvantages of having affected or interested parties involved in negotiations.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice is issued pursuant to section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),
7 U.S.C. 136d(f)(1). It announces the Agency's decision to grant Soil Chemicals Corp.'s request for cancellation
of the registration of Brom 70/30 (EPA registration number 8536-10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brom 70/30 is a fumigant product used to control nematodes and soil fungi as well as several other soil-borne pathogens
on strawberries, tomatoes, seed beds, and floral and nursery crops. This product contains 1,3-dichloropropene
and methyl bromide, and EPA has recently taken action affecting the regulatory status of both of these active ingredients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,3-Dichloropropene is registered by DowElanco and is marketed as Telone and Telone C-17. In addition to selling
Telone as an end-use product, DowElanco also sells Telone to reformulators such as Soil Chemicals Corp., who add other
active ingredients for specialized pesticidal needs. 1,3-Dichloropropene was placed in EPA's special review in
1986 based on cancer concerns for applicators and loaders. Groundwater contamination and possible residues in food
were also noted. Several studies were required through the pesticide reregistration program to further define human
exposure and potential ground water contamination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 7, 1992, EPA and DowElanco entered into an agreement to modify the registrations and labels of its 1,3-dichloropropene
products to reflect risk-reduction measures. The risk reduction measures were sought both through use reduction
and through 1,3-dichloropropene-specific technology to reduce the amount of the chemical that escapes into the
atmosphere. In addition, timeframes were set for all remaining studies, and DowElanco revised its product stewardship
program to reflect the label changes. The agreement also specified that a clause be added to the Telone labels requiring
that any product reformulated from or containing the Telone product bear an EPA-approved label containing all of
the required changes in the timeframes specified in the agreement. EPA sent copies of the agreement to all registrants
of products containing Telone with instructions as to how and when to respond.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 24, 1993, Soil Chemicals Corp. submitted labels for the first label changes from the October 1992 agreement,
which were to take effect June 30, 1993. Soil Chemicals Corp. submitted labels for its 1,3-dichloropropene/chloropicrin
products, as well as the Brom 70/30 product. These labels were rejected because new uses had been added to the revised
labels without proper compensation agreements, as well as for other deficiencies. Soil Chemicals Corp. resubmitted
corrected revised labels for the products containing 1,3-dichloropropene and chloropicrin, but none for Brom 70/30.
Because the Brom 70/30 label does not contain the required changes for 1,3-dichloropropene, this product is now misbranded
under FIFRA section 12(a)(1)(E) and subject to enforcement action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA issued its final regulation for the worker protection standard (WPS) on August 21, 1992. The WPS provides
basic information and protective measures for all persons involved in the handling of pesticides both during and
after application. EPA decided to issue guidance for each fumigant separately since the chemical properties, and
thus protective requirements, of each fumigant differ greatly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to 1,3-dichloropropene's small molecular size and high volatility, EPA requires tight-fitting protection,
such as respirators, gloves, and face-sealing goggles. For methyl bromide, however, its corrosivity demands loose-fitting
protective clothing. If tight-fitting clothing were also worn during methyl bromide use, the trapped chemical could
cause serious skin damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the conflicting WPS requirements and noncompliance with the label requirements arising from the October
1992 agreement, EPA issued a letter to Soil Chemicals Corp. on March 7, 1994, outlining the issues as discussed above,
and explaining regulatory options to address the non-compliance with both the Telone label and the WPS.

II. Request for Voluntary Cancellation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a letter dated March 21, 1994, Soil Chemicals Corp. requested voluntary cancellation of Brom 70/30. The company
noted in the letter that it had not sold the product for the past 2 years and, further, claimed that neither the company
nor supplemental distributors have any product under their custody. This claim is supported by results of a 1990 Data
Call-In that was issued to collect information on use, usage, and product performance from 1988 to 1990. Soil Chemicals
Corp. reported no use of Brom 70/30. In addition, Soil Chemicals Corp. asked that the 90-day comment period allowed
by section 6(f) of FIFRA be waived.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. EPA's Decision on the Request for Voluntary Cancellation and Existing Stocks Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is hereby granting Soil Chemicals Corp.'s request to cancel the registration of Brom 70/30. EPA is not allowing
the sale, distribution, or use of any existing stocks due to Soil Chemicals Corp.'s noncompliance with the October
1992 agreement and the requirements associated with the WPS. That standard mandates that any product sold after April
21, 1994 must bear language from the WPS. Because Soil Chemicals Corp. has not submitted a label for approval, any Brom
70/30 product is out of compliance and subject to enforcement action. EPA expects little or no impact to distributors
or users because the registrant reported no stocks in the channels of trade, and because the results of a 1990 Data Call-In
for products containing 1,3-dichloropropene showed no use of this product from 1988 to 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Cancellation Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 6(f)(1) of FIFRA, a registrant may request at any time that EPA cancel any of its pesticide registrations.
EPA must publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of receipt of the request to allow public comment before granting the request unless either the registrant
requests a waiver of the notice or the Administrator determines that the continued use of the pesticide would pose
unreasonable adverse affects on the environment. Soil Chemicals Corp. requested voluntary cancellation and waived
any comment period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I approve the order cancelling the registration of Brom 70/30. Accordingly, this cancellation shall be effective
and no person may distribute, sell, or use this product as of August 10,1994. Any sale, distribution or other disposition
of existing stocks that is not consistent with the terms of this Order will be considered a violation of FIFRA section
12(a)(2)(K) and/or section 12(a)(1)(A), as appropriate.

Description: In the Second Report and Order issued in GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252, the Commission adopted rules to implement
Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by Section 6000(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993. The new rules adopted: (1) interpret the elements that define the terms ``commercial mobile radio service
(CMRS)'' and ``private mobile radio service (PMRS);'' (2) based on these definitions, determine the regulatory
status of existing mobile services and of personal communications services (PCS); (3) address the degree to which
those services that will be classified as CMRS will be subject to regulation under Title II of the Act; and (4) address
the other issues, including interconnection rights and preemption of state regulatory authority over mobile service
providers. Traditional private carriers now reclassified as commercial mobile radio services providers will be
subject to certain Title II provisions. The statute preempts state regulation of entry and rates for both CMRS and
PMRS providers. States may petition the Commission for authority to regulate CMRS rates under some circumstances.
The information collected as a result of this rulemaking will create regulatory symmetry among similar mobile services.
This symmetrical regulatory structure will promote competition in the mobile services marketplace and will serve
the interests of consumers while also benefitting the national economy.

Notice is given that a complaint filed by Amzone International, Inc. and Universal Cargo Management, Inc. (``Complainants'')
against Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., Ltd. (``Respondent'') was served August 4, 1994. Complainants allege that

and 1709(b)(12), by failing and refusing to make available, in response to ``me-too'' requests, the essential terms
of a service contract to Complainants, both of which are alleged to be similarly situated shippers, on the same basis
as made available to the original contract shipper, and by granting another Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier's
``me-too'' request for the same service contract.

Title: Inventory of Child Care Management Information Systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB No. New.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is responsible for a number of Federal programs which promote
the economic self-sufficiency and social well-being of low-income families and children. Current ACF child care
programs that provide funding to States, Territories, Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations for this purpose include:
Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)/Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS), At-Risk Child
Care (ARCC), Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), and Transitional
Child Care (TCC).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years, Federally-funded child care programs have grown in complexity and size. Increased monitoring and
reporting is required in order to assure program accountability and respond effectively to congressional requests
for information about the management, integration and use of funds for these various child care programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until recently, ACF has awarded grants to States, Territories, Indian Tribes, and Tribal organizations to develop
and enhance the automation of child care program operations. To this end, grantees were encouraged to use computers
and information systems technologies to operate their child care programs more efficiently and effectively. However,
no systematic approach has been untaken by ACF to determine the scope of management information systems (MIS), especially
the computerization of day care operations or the capabilities, utilization, functions and configuration of computer
systems for the management and administration of Federal child care programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This survey will be used to develop an inventory of child care MIS for State, Territory and Tribal Grantees. ACF needs
this information to develop baseline information from which to identify technical assistance needs of its grantees.
In addition, this information will assist ACF in program evaluation, management, and monitoring of child care programs.

A copy of the NOFA is attached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAs that are interested in participating in the program will use an application kit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The information provided by the applicants will be reviewed and evaluated against the ranking factors contained
in the NOFA for possible funding. The applicants will be notified of their selection/rejection. The information
is necessary so that the applicants can apply and compete for funding opportunities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. We have considered the use of improved technology since there is no other way to obtain the information except directly
from the HAs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There will be no duplication of information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. There is no similar information already available which could be used or modified for this purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. We have attempted to minimize the burden on the public housing agencies by using an application kit which includes
all the necessary documents for application purposes and contains detailed instructions for completing the information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The information will be collected on a one-time basis as funding is available for Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. There are no special circumstances that require the collection to be conducted in a manner which is inconsistent
with the guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Before and during the drafting of the NOFA, informal meetings were held with Executive Directors of Housing Authorities,
Youth Corps organizations, and labor union representatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. No assurances of confidentiality is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. No sensitive questions were asked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. We do not estimate that there will be any additional costs for the Federal Government. The applications will be
reviewed in accordance with HUD's existing review and monitoring requirements. Annual cost to the respondent is
estimated to be minimal since the application submission may be prepared by the public housing agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. We estimate that the information requirement of the proposed NOFA will have the following reporting burdens:

supplementary information: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 21, 1994, the Department published a Notice of Funding Availability for Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control
in Priority Housing (FR&hyph;3643) in the Federal Register at 59 FR 19880 (``NOFA''). The NOFA announced the availability
of $142 million for grants to States and local governments. The NOFA also stated that to be considered for funding,
an original and two copies of the application must be physically received in the Office of Lead-Based Paint Abatement
and Poisoning Prevention in Washington no later than 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time on July 6, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the three days immediately prior to the date that applications were due under the NOFA, July 4 through July 6, East
Central Illinois, specifically Southeastern Cook County, Will County and Kankakee County, were subjected to severe
weather conditions, which disrupted electrical service to many of the communities in this part of Illinois.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, due to a weather emergency and a prolonged regional power outage, the Department is extending the deadline
of 3:00 pm Eastern Time on July 6, 1994 for submission of applications under the NOFA for Southeastern Cook County,
Will County and Kankakee County, Illinois. The Department will accept applications received from this region by
3:00 pm Eastern Time on July 7, 1994 if (1) the applicant submits a certification demonstrating that the applicant's
ability to prepare or submit the application was substantially impaired by the above-described power outage; and
(2) the Department approves the certification.

and Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act (ELIHPA) Programs

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Notice sets forth amended processing instructions for Title II and Title VI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title II has over 4 years of operating experience and Title VI has over a year and a half of operating experience. During
this time, we have received numerous suggestions and comments from the Field as well as the industry regarding program
changes. After reviewing these suggestions and comments, we have determined that a number of policies and instructions
set forth in the current Notices and HUD Handbook 4350.6 should be revised to speed the delivery of the programs and
better serve our clientele.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In preparing these instructions, we were aware of the problems some Offices were experiencing coordinating the different
review functions, which has in some cases made the program more difficult to administer. We have assembled a combined
Housing Management-Housing Development preservation unit to work exclusively on this program. This unit has proven
beneficial in understanding and providing solutions to the different review functions. This Notice contains instructions
for both the Production and Asset Management Branches. It is hoped that combining these instructions will eliminate
some of the coordination problems, provide additional processing tools and the administrative flexibility needed
to better administer the program.

Applicability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following language replaces that published in this part of MCCII, because some public commenters claim that the
language was ambiguous:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These instructions apply to all Title II and Title VI processing stages not already completed by June 6, 1994, the issuance
date of this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an owner or purchaser made a submission prior to June 6, 1994, or the HUD Field Office did an analysis or issued a decision
prior to June 6, 1994, the submission, analysis, or decision 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
need not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be revised. The owner or purchaser 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at its option, request that it be allowed to make a new submission or that HUD staff do a new analysis or make a new decision
based on MCCII. If an owner requests further processing by HUD staff, it should include with the request authorization
to extend the processing period sufficiently, if applicable. All reasonable requests should be honored by the HUD
Field Office staff. In no case will HUD staff require a new submission; nor will it unilaterally reanalyze or make a
new decision where such action has already been completed.

Intent after June 6, 1994.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Davenport Limited (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit
pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(b) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned permit number
PRT&hyph;782829. The requested permit, which is for a period not to exceed 20 years, would authorize the incidental
take of the endangered black-capped vireo (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Vireo atricapillus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). The proposed take would occur as a result of the construction and operation of a residential development within
the 210-acre tract of lands known as Davenport Ranch west of Austin, Travis County, Texas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has prepared an environmental assessment/habitat conservation plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take
permit application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) will
not be made before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c)
of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6)

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``Taking'' of endangered species, like the black-capped vireo. However, the Service,
under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is incidental
to, and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are
at 50 CFR 17.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicant plans to build a residential development located west of Austin approximately 2 miles north of the intersection
of Highway 360 and Farm to Market road 2244 in Travis County, Texas. The development will occupy approximately 107.8
acres with 22.5 acres proposed as parkland and 13.9 acres as greenbelt. These activities will permanently eliminate
about 33 acres of occupied and/or suitable black-capped vireo habitat. The Applicant proposes to mitigate the incidental
take by avoiding direct impacts to vireos, preserving undeveloped areas in their natural state, and by creating,
enhancing, and maintaining 100 acres of black-capped vireo habitat offsite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant considered five alternatives but rejected four of them because they were not economically viable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Restoring endangered or threatened animals or plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members
of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most listed species native to the Unites
States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria
for recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing recovery measures
needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), requires development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote conservation of
a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity for
public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during the public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and
other Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery
plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This recovery plan addresses recovery needs of five species which share a common habitat area by using an ecosystem
approach that addresses conservation of basic habitat features the organisms share. The Draft Plan also addresses
more localized or species specific problems and needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fountain darter was listed as endangered on October 13, 1970 (35 FR 16047) and critical habitat was designated
on July 14, 1980 (45 FR 47355). The fountain darter is a small fish that inhabits both the Comal and San Marcos ecosystems
and was described by early collectors to be abundant in both ecosystems. Fountain darters prefer constant temperature
and undisturbed stream floor habitats that have a mixture of submergent plants and mats of filamentous algae.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Marcos gambusia was listed as endangered with critical habitat on July 14, 1980 (45 FR 47355). This fish has
only been known to occur in a small segment of the San Marcos River and apparently prefers relatively shallow, quiet,
shaded, and thermally constant waters over a muddy substrate. The San Marcos gambusia has not been relocated since
1982, although several surveys have been made in its historical habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Marcos salamander was listed as threatened with critical habitat on July 14, 1980 (45 FR 47355). It is a small
salamander that remains aquatic throughout its life cycle. The San Marcos salamander occurs in rocky or sand and gravel
areas with thermally constant, flowing water near spring openings. Habitat for this salamander usually includes
aquatic mosses or filimentous algae that provide cover and food. San Marcos salamanders have been found near all major
spring openings scattered throughout Spring Lake at headwaters of the San Marcos River system, and extending into
rocky habitat below Spring Lake Dam.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas wild-rice is an aquatic plant that was listed as endangered on April 26, 1978, (43 FR 17910) and critical habitat
designated on July 14, 1980 (45 FR 47355). This plant is only known from the San Marcos River system where it was once
abundant in Spring Lake and the river. By 1967, the species had declined significantly in abundance and distribution.
Plants usually grow underwater except for emergent flowering stalks, and are found in constant temperature, flowing
water of varying depths.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Texas blind salamander was listed as endangered on March 11, 1967 (32 FR 4001). It is a small aquatic, unpigmented
salamander with reduced eyes that are cave-adapted. The Texas blind salamander's habitat is in water-filled cavernous
areas in the San Marcos portion of the Edward's Aquifer. The species has been collected and studied through collections
and observations made from caves with pools that access the underground water table, and from well samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most imminent threat facing the five listed aquatic species is loss of stream flows and/or water levels in the Edward's
Aquifer necessary to sustain the Edward's Aquifer and associated stream ecosystems. The species are also threatened
by pollution from runoff or discharges associated with urbanization of surrounding areas. Additional threats include
impacts from recreational activities, predation, and habitat destruction or modification caused by human activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective of the Draft Plan is to secure the survival of these endangered or threatened species in their native
ecosystems. Downlisting criteria are given in the plan for two of the five species. The Draft Plan addresses broad
regional threats to ecosystem integrity as well as local threats to each species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional recovery efforts outlined in the Draft Plan include protection of the Edward's Aquifer, the San Marcos springs
and river ecosystem, and the Comal springs and river ecosystem. The Draft Plan addresses need for a mechanism to manage
groundwater withdrawals in order to assure continued springflows, and identification and management of existing
or potential impacts to water quality in the Edwards Aquifer and the Comal and San Marcos River ecosystems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address more local threats, the Draft Plan recommends development of local spring and river management plans,
control of non-native species, and cooperative work with local landowners and water users to alleviate threats to
the affected species and their habitat. Other recovery efforts outlined include developing propagation techniques
and maintaining a broodstock that represents genetics of existing wild populations. The Draft Plan includes tasks
to continue monitoring the status of all five species and their habitats, research to determine the biological and
ecological requirements of each species, studies to evaluate threats and develop management techniques of each
species, and inform the public of significance of these ecosystems to maintaining the Region's economy and quality
of life for all.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Dendroica chrysoparia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). The take would occur as a result of the construction of and operation of a residential development on a 270-acre tract
in Austin, Travis County, Texas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has prepared an environmental assessment/habitat conservation plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take
permit application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) will
not be made before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``Taking'' of endangered species, like the golden-cheeked warbler. However, the
Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is incidental
to, and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are
at 50 CFR 17.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicant plans to build a residential development located northwest of Austin near the intersection of Ranch
Road 2222 and City Park Road in Travis County, Texas. The development will occupy approximately 116 acres with the
remaining 153 acres proposed as a conservation area. These activities will permanently eliminate about 107 acres
of occupied golden-cheeked warbler habitat. The Applicant proposes to mitigate the incidental take via preservation
and management of about 153 acres as a golden-cheeked warbler preserve through a conservation easement. Additionally,
the Applicant will conduct territorial mapping surveys on lands adjacent to the proposed development, provide operating
and maintenance funds for the lands (on-site 153 acres) to be preserved, conduct the necessary biological surveys,
minimize clearing of lots, establish a 300-foot buffer of no construction from a golden-cheeked warbler territory
during the breeding season, and revegetate with native plant species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant considered three alternatives but rejected two of them because they were not economically viable.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the provisions of NEPA, the Service prepared an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the reintroduction
of gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. The conference report (House Report No. 102&hyph;256)
that accompanied the 1992 U.S. Department of the Interior appropriations bill (Public Law 102&hyph;154) directed
the Service to prepare a draft EIS on wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho, in consultation
with the National Park Service and Forest Service. The conference report further directed that the EIS cover a broad
range of alternatives and follow normal distribution patterns including appropriate Congressional distribution.
The 1993 U.S. Department of the Interior appropriations bill (Public Law 102&hyph;381) directed the Service to finalize
the EIS and stated that it expected the preferred alternative to conform to existing law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service evaluated and considered alternatives for the long range recovery and management of wolf populations
in the Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho areas as presented in the FEIS and reviewed and considered public
and agency comments. Based upon that evaluation and review, the Service selected the Proposed Action Alternative
as described in the FEIS for implementation. Reintroduced populations of gray wolves are proposed to be designated
as nonessential experimental populations according to the provisions of section 10(j) of the Act. A proposed nonessential
experimental population rule will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and provided for review by the public. Based upon public comment and the results of a continuing Service-led monitoring
program to document wolf breeding activity in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, the Service will decide whether to issue
and implement a final rule as soon as practicable. The process to establish these regulatory guidelines and the opportunity
for public comment will be widely publicized. This determination was based on a thorough analysis of environmental,
social, economic, and similar considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 15, 1994, the Secretary of the Interior approved a Statement of Findings and Record of Decision adopting the
selected alternative. On July 19, 1994, the Secretary of Agriculture approved a concurring Record of Decision. These
documents are available from the office named above under

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
H. L. &amp; W. Coal Company, 14 Maple Street, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania 17963 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.335 (construction of seals) to its H. L. &amp; W. Slope No. 2 (I.D. No. 36&hyph;07269) located in Schuylkill
County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner requests a modification of the standard to permit alternative methods of seal
construction using wooden materials of moderate size and weight due to the difficulty in accessing previously driven
headings and breasts containing inaccessible abandoned workings; to accept a design criterion in the 10 psi range;
and to permit the water trap to be installed in the gangway seal and sampling tube in the monkey seal for seals installed
in pairs. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection
as would the mandatory standard.

H. L. &amp; W. Coal Company, 14 Maple Street, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania 17963 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.340 (underground electrical installations) to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
H. L. &amp; W. Slope No. 2 (I.D. No. 36&hyph;07269) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. As an alternative
to removing the batteries and transporting them in the gunboat to the surface for charging, the petitioner proposes
to charge batteries on the mine's locomotive when all miners are out of the mine and to have the intake air which is used
to ventilate the charging station continue through its normal route to the last open crosscut and into the monkey airway
(return). The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection
as would the mandatory standard.

H. L. &amp; W. Coal Company, 14 Maple Street, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania 17963 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.360 (preshift examination) to its H. L. &amp; W. Slope No. 2 (I.D. No. 36&hyph;07269) located in Schuylkill
County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to examine each seal for physical damage from the slope gunboat during
the preshift examination after an air quantity reading is taken inby the intake portal and to test for the quantity
and quality of air at the intake air split locations off the slope in the gangway portion of the working section. The
petitioner proposes to physically examine the entire length of the slope once a month. The petitioner asserts that
the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Due to hazardous conditions and roof falls, certain areas of the intake
haulage slope and primary escapeway cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to examine these areas from
the gunboat/slope car with an alternative air quality evaluation at the section's intake level, and to travel and
thoroughly examine these areas for hazardous conditions once a month. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate
method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use cross-sections instead of contour lines through the intake
slope, at locations of rock tunnel connections between veins, and at 1,000 feet intervals of advance from the intake
slope and to limit the mapping of mine workings above and below to those present within 100 feet of the vein being mined
except when veins are interconnected to other veins beyond the 100 feet limit through rock tunnels. The petitioner
asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory
standard.

4, Box 393A, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania 17963 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1100&hyph;2(a)(2)
(quantity and location of firefighting equipment) to its L. V. No. 3 Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08405) located in Schuylkill
County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use only portable fire extinguishers to replace existing requirements
where rock dust, water cars, and other water storage are not practical. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate
method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

(i) (mine map) to its L. V. No. 3 Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08405) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner
proposes to use cross-sections instead of contour lines through the intake slope, at locations of rock tunnel connections
between veins, and at 1,000 feet intervals of advance from the intake slope and to limit the mapping of mine workings
above and below to those present within 100 feet of the vein being mined except when veins are interconnected to other
veins beyond the 100 feet limit through rock tunnels. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would
provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

Consolidation Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241&hyph;1421 has filed a petition
to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.503 (permissible electric face equipment; maintenance) to its Dilworth Mine
(I.D. No. 36&hyph;04281) located in Greene County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use 800 feet trailing
cables with three-phase 480 volt to supply power to loading machines, shuttle cars, roof bolters and section ventilation
fans while developing longwall panels. The petitioner states that the cables would not be smaller than No. 4 A.W.G.
for the ventilation fans, center bolters, and shuttle cars and not smaller than No. 2 A.W.G. for the loading machines;
and that adequate training would be provided to all miners designated necessary by the operator. The petitioner asserts
that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

R &amp; S Coal Company, 8 West Main Street, Goodspring, Pennsylvania 17981 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.1400 (hoisting equipment; general) to its Primrose Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08221) located in Schuylkill
County, Pennsylvania. Because of the steep, frequently changing pitch and numerous curves and knuckles in the main
haulage slope, the petitioner proposes to use the gunboat without safety catches in transporting persons. As an alternative,
when using the gunboat to transport persons, the petitioner proposes to use an increased rope strength safety factor
and secondary safety connections which are securely fastened around the gunboat and to the hoisting rope above the
main connecting device. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same
measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

Genwal Coal Company, P.O. Box 1420, Huntington, Utah 84528 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR
75.350 (air courses and belt haulage entries) to its Crandall Canyon Mine (I.D. No. 40&hyph;01715) located in Emery
County, Utah. The petitioner proposes to use belt air to ventilate the face area and to install a low-level carbon monoxide
detection system that would provide both visual and audible alarm signals as an early warning device in belt entries
used as intake air courses, which would provide two separate and distinct intake air escapeways to the miners working
in the development sections. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least
the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Co. (Haddam Neck Plant); Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR&hyph;61, issued to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPCO, the licensee), for operation
of the Haddam Neck Plant, located in Middlesex County, Connecticut.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment will revise the Haddam Neck Technical Specifications (TS) to allow an increased limit for
fuel enrichment. The change will allow the storage of fuel with an enrichment not to exceed a nominal 5.0 weight percent
(w/o) U&hyph;235 in the Haddam Neck Plant new and spent fuel storage racks. The proposed action is in accordance with
the licensee's amendment request dated January 6, 1994, as supplemented March 16, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current new and spent fuel storage rack maximum nominal enrichment is 3.9 w/o U&hyph;235 for Zircaloy clad fuel
and 4.0 w/o U&hyph;235 for stainless steel clad fuel. The licensee has changed fuel vendors and has ordered higher
enriched fuel (5.0 w/o U&hyph;235) for the upcoming outage scheduled to start in January 1995. The TS change is necessary
for the storage of the new and eventually used fuel in the new and spent fuel storage racks. The licensee is planning
to go to a longer cycle, which requires the use of the higher enriched fuel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision to the TS. The staff has concluded that the analysis
methods used are acceptable and capable of predicting the reactivity of the Haddam Neck Plant storage racks with a
high degree of confidence. The licensee has analyzed the new fuel storage racks for three different configurations
as required by the NRC and determined that the staff criteria are met. Storage of fuel assemblies with nominal enrichments
greater than 4.60 w/o U&hyph;235 were evaluated by means of reactivity equivalencing. This concept is predicated
on the reactivity decrease associated with the addition of integral fuel burnable absorbers (IFBA), which the staff
has found acceptable in previous fuel storage applications. Fuel in the spent fuel racks was analyzed using alternating
rows of fresh and burned (irradiated) fuel assemblies. For nominal storage cell design, uncertainties due to tolerances
in fuel enrichment and density, fuel pellet dishing, storage cell I.D. and pitch, stainless steel thickness, and
B4C panel width were accounted for as well as eccentric fuel positioning. To enable the storage of burned fuel assemblies
initially enriched to greater than 3.2 w/o U&hyph;235, the concept of burnup credit reactivity equivalencing was
used. This analysis is predicated upon the reactivity decrease associated with fuel depletion and has been previously
accepted by the staff for spent fuel storage analysis. The maximum Keff of the alternating rows storage configuration
was 0.9485 when combined with all known uncertainties and meets the staff criteria of Keff less than 0.95.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TS change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types
of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or
cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
radiological environmental impacts associated with this proposed TS amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendment does involve features located entirely
within the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has
no other environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental impacts of transportation resulting from the use of more highly enriched fuel and extended burnup
rates have been discussed in the generic staff assessment entitled ``NRC Assessment of the Environmental Effects
of Transportation Resulting from Extended Fuel Enrichment and Irradiation,'' dated July 7, 1988, and published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 11, 1988 (53 FR 30355) as corrected on August 24 1988 (53 FR 32322). As indicted therein, the environmental
cost contribution of the proposed increase in fuel enrichment and irradiation limits are either unchanged or may
in fact be reduced from those summarized in Table S&hyph;4 as set forth in 10 CFR 51.52(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the staff concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological environmental impacts
associated with the proposed amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed amendment,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the amendment would be to deny the amendment request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment
and would result in unjustified cost to the licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not considered previously in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Haddam Neck Plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff consulted with the Connecticut State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated January 6, 1994, as supplemented
March 16, 1994, which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,
2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Russell Library, 123 Broad

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of its regulations to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;32, DPR&hyph;37, NPF&hyph;4, and NPF&hyph;7 issued
to Virginia Electric and Power Company, (the licensee), for operation of the Surry Power Station Units 1 and 2, located
in Surry County, Virginia, and North Anna Power Station Units 1 and 2, located in Louisa County, Virginia.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application dated May 27, 1994, for exemption from certain
requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors
against radiological sabotage.'' The exemption would allow implementation of a hand geometry biometric system
for site access control such that picture badges and access control cards for certain non-employees can be taken offsite.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, paragraph (a), the licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection
system and security organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), specifies that ``licensee shall control all points of
personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) specifies that ``A numbered picture badge
identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.''
10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., contractors) may be authorized
access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the
protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area *&blank;*&blank;*''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, employee and contractor identification badges, coupled with their associated access control cards,
are issued and retrieved on the occasion of each entry to and exit from the protected areas of the Surry and North Anna
sites. Station security personnel are required to maintain control of the badges while the individuals are offsite.
This practice has been in effect at the Surry and North Anna Power Stations since each operating license was issued.
Security personnel retain each identification badge, as well as the associated access control card, when not in use
by the authorized individual, within appropriately designed storage receptacles inside a bullet-resistant enclosure.
An individual who meets the access authorization requirements is issued an individual picture identification card
and an individual access control card which allows entry into preauthorized areas of the station. While entering
the plant in the present configuration, an authorized individual is ``screened'' by the required detection equipment
and by the issuing security officer. Having received the badge, the individual proceeds to the access portal, inserts
the access control card into the card readers, enters a personal identification number (PIN), and passes through
the turnstile which unlocks if the preset criteria are met. Once inside the station, the individual's PIN is not required
in order to further utilize the access authorization card.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This present procedure is labor intensive since security personnel are required to verify badge issuance, ensure
badge retrieval, and maintain the badges in orderly storage until the next entry into the protected area. The regulations
permit employees to remove their badges from the site, but an exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to permit
contractors to take their badges offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has completed its evaluation of the licensee's application. Under the proposed system, all individuals
authorized to gain unescorted access will have the physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) recorded
with their badge number. Since the hand geometry is unique to each individual and its application in the entry screening
function would preclude unauthorized use of a badge, the requested exemption would allow employees and contractors
to keep their badges at the time of exiting the protected area. The process of verifying badge issuance, ensuring badge
retrieval, and maintaining badges could be eliminated while the balance of the access procedure would remain intact.
Firearm, explosive, and metal detection equipment and provisions for conducting searches will remain as well. The
security officer responsible for the last access control function (controlling admission to the protected area)
will also remain isolated within a bullet-resistant structure in order to assure his or her ability to respond or to
summon assistance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of a hand geometry biometrics system exceeds the present verification methodology's capability to discern an
individual's identity. Unlike the photograph identification badge, hand geometry is nontransferable. During
the initial access authorization or registration process, hand measurements are recorded and the template is stored
for subsequent use in the identity verification process required for entry into the protected area. Authorized individuals
insert their access authorization card into the card reader and the biometrics system records an image of the hand
geometry. The unique features of the newly recorded image are then compared to the template previously stored in the
database. Access is ultimately granted based on the degree to which the characteristics of the image match those of
the ``signature'' template.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since both the badge and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected area, the proposed system would
provide for a positive verification process. Potential loss of a badge by an individual, as a result of taking the badge
offsite, would not enable an unauthorized entry into protected areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The access process will continue to be under the observation of security personnel. The system of identification
badges coupled with their associated access control cards will continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized
access to protected areas without escorts. Badges will continue to be displayed by all individuals while inside the
protected area. Addition of a hand geometry biometrics system will provide a significant contribution to effective
implementation of the security plan at each site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental
impact. With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed change does not affect non-radiological
plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered denial of the proposed action. Denial of the application
would result in no change in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and
the alternative action are similar.

This action did not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statements
related to operation of Surry Units 1 and 2, and North Anna Units 1 and 2.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based
upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to two separate license amendment requests from licensee Centerior Energy (Centerior) dated June 2, 1994
and June 6, 1994, the staff hereby notices the request by Centerior to amend the Perry Nuclear Power Plant (Perry) and
Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (Davis-Besse) operating licenses to reflect a new owner-operator of Perry and
Davis-Besse. The new owner-operator, temporarily named (``NEWCO'' by Centerior, will result from the proposed
merger between the Toledo Edison Company (TE) and the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI)_both existing
licensees and owners of the Perry and Davis-Besse facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff has interpreted the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations, to require
an antitrust review of an owner or operator prior to the proposed new owner taking possession of the facility or prior
to the proposed new operator assuming responsibility for operating the facility in question. Where the new operator
is a non-owner, the staff has developed, with the Commission's approval, an antitrust license condition that prohibits
the new operator from marketing or brokering power or energy from the facility. (This type of license condition would
not apply in the instant case because NEWCO will be both an owner and an operator of Perry and Davis-Besse.) The intent
of the staff in developing the non-owner operator license condition is to forgo the need for an extended review of the
operator's competitive practices and any accompanying analysis of how any practices impact or could impact the electric
bulk power services market. By agreeing not to be involved in the facility's marketing or brokering of bulk power services,
the staff believes the new non-owner operator will not possess enough market power to significantly impact the market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The instant amendment requests involve two licensees, TE and CEI, that have undergone antitrust reviews by the staff
at the construction permit and operating license stages of the licensing process. The construction permit antitrust
review in the combined Perry/Davis-Besse proceeding resulted in extensive antitrust license conditions obligating
TE and CEI to cease certain anticompetitive practices and make available certain bulk power services to power entities
in the affected bulk power services market. This review analyzed the practices of the power pooling group known as
CAPCO, i.e., Central Area Power Coordination Group, as a whole and also the practices of the five individual utility
operating companies, including TE and CEI, that made up CAPCO. The staff believes the construction permit antitrust
review and the operating license review, which found no significant antitrust changes since the previous review,
adequately defined the problems associated with TE's and CEI's competitive practices and addressed these problems
during the review process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The license conditions that evolved from the Commission's antitrust review process are extensive and procompetitive.
The licensee has agreed that the new owner-operator will be bound by the existing antitrust license conditions now
binding TE and CEI_by doing so, the staff believes that there is no need to conduct another antitrust review as a result
of the proposed merger nor is there any need to seek public comment on the proposed merger.

Mr. Raymond Tarr was President and Mr. Milton R. Hamilton was an authorized user and the Executive Vice-President
of Omni-Wave Electronics Corporation (Licensee), the holder of expired Byproduct Materials License No. 20&hyph;05520&hyph;05
(License) issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 30 on November 15,
1985. The License authorized the possession and use of cobalt-60 in any form, up to 10 millicuries, and krypton-85
in any form, up to 500 millicuries, in accordance with the conditions specified therein. The License expired on April

Since the expiration of the License, the byproduct material has remained at 22 Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, Massachusetts,
01930, in a building co-owned by Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton. It was represented to the NRC during a telephone conversation
on August 20, 1992, between Mr. Milton Hamilton, Licensee, and Mr. Charles Amato, NRC, that there has been two successors
of Omni-Wave Electronics, RCM Corporation and Cherokee Electronics Corporation. The Licensee did not submit an
application for renewal of the License pursuant to 10 CFR 30.37 prior to its expiration, nor did the Licensee notify
the Commission, in writing, pursuant to 10 CFR 30.36, of a decision not to renew the License. On January 27, 1992, the
NRC, Region I, issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to the RCM Corporation, ATTN: Mr. Milton Hamilton, as successor to
the Licensee, for failure to request renewal, or to file a notice of non-renewal or transfer of the byproduct material,
prior to expiration of the License. The letter forwarding the NOV directed RCM Corporation to place the radioactive
material in its possession in secure storage until such time as it acquired an NRC license, and stated that no other
use of that material or purchase of additional material was authorized. RCM Corporation applied for a possession
license on March 19, 1992. However, in a telephone conversation with Mr. Charles G. Amato, Health Physicist, NRC,
Region I, on July 29, 1992, Mr. Hamilton stated that RCM Corporation was undergoing reorganization and requested
that the application be withdrawn. In a letter dated August 3, 1992, the RCM Corporation withdrew its application
for a possession license. As of this date, you Omni-Wave, RCM Corporation or Cherokee Electronics Corporation have
not applied for, nor obtained, an NRC license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 11, 1993, the NRC, Region I, issued a Confirmatory Action Letter No. 1&hyph;93&hyph;004 (CAL) to Mr. Milton
Hamilton of the Omni-Wave Electronics Corporation confirming the Licensee's commitment to develop and submit a
decommissioning plan to the NRC Region I office by September 15, 1993, and that the decommissioning work be completed
by November 15, 1993. The CAL also stated that Omni-Wave Electronics committed to prepare and transmit to the NRC by
November 15, 1993, a report showing the disposition of radioactive material with copies of all shipping papers. On
September 9, 1993, Mr. Hamilton requested an extension to the date stated in the CAL, in order to raise funds for the
completion of the decommissioning. He stated that due to a very tight budget and the approximate cost for decommissioning,
it was anticipated that the decommissioning would be accomplished within 30&hyph;45 days. As of this date, a report
has not been transmitted to NRC describing the decommissioning of the facility, nor have copies of shipping papers
been submitted to the NRC showing the disposition of radioactive material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 15, 1994, the NRC conducted a special confirmatory safety inspection at 22 Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, Massachusetts.
The inspection was performed to identify licensed material still in possession under an expired license and to assure
that the material was in safe storage. The inspection included the pump room area of the facility, the manufacturing
area, and the storage area used for licensed material. The NRC inspector identified cobalt-60 and krypton-85 byproduct
material, cobalt-60 contamination, and cobalt-60 waste, at the facility located at 22 Blackburn Drive, Gloucester,
Massachusetts.

Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton, as co-owners of the building at 22 Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, Massachusetts, remain
in possession of non-exempt radioactive material without a license. This is prohibited by Section 81 of the Atomic
Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended, and by 10 CFR 30.3, which state that, (except for persons exempt as provided in
10 CFR Parts 30 and 150), no person shall possess or use byproduct material except as authorized in a specific or general
NRC license. Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton continue to possess the radioactive material contrary to Section 81 of the
AEA and 10 CFR 30.3, without an NRC license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Improper handling of the byproduct material can result in unnecessary exposure to radiation. The Atomic Energy Act
and the Commission's regulations require that the possession of licensed material be under a regulated system of
licensing and inspection. Given the circumstances surrounding Messrs. Tarr's and Hamilton's possession of the
byproduct material and failure of Mr. Hamilton, whether acting on the behalf of the Licensee or RCM Corporation, as
successor to the Licensee, or as an individual, to respond adequately to the NOV and CAL, I lack the requisite reasonable
assurance that the health and safety of the public will be protected while Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton remain in possession
of the radioactive material without the required NRC license.

B. Continue to maintain safe control over the byproduct material, by keeping the material in locked storage and no
allowing any person access to the material, except for purposes of assuring the material's continued safe storage,
until the material is transferred to a person authorized to receive and possess the material in accordance with the
provisions of this Order and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Transfer the cobalt-60 and the krypton-85 byproduct material and all associated radioactively contaminated
waste located at 22 Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, Massachusetts within 30 days to a person authorized to receive and
possess the material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Decommission the facility within 60 days of the date of this Order and DFI and provide: (1) a notification of when
decommissioning has been completed, and (2) a report providing the information required by 10 CFR 30.36 (c)(1)(v)(A)
and (c)(1)(v)(B), appending to it the original and one copy of NRC Form&hyph;314, ``Disposition of Radioactive Material,''
with copies of all shipping papers. This 60 day period does not excuse the continuing violation of the requirements
in 10 CFR 30.36 to remove radioactive contamination, properly dispose of byproduct material, submit a completed
form NRC&hyph;314, and conduct a radiation survey of the premises.

In addition to issuance of this Order, the Commission requires further information from Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton
in order to determine whether the Commission can have reasonable assurance that in the future, should Messrs. Tarr
or Hamilton perform licensed activities under any other NRC license, Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton will conduct any activities
in accordance with NRC requirements, and to determine whether enforcement action is warranted against Messrs. Tarr
or Hamilton, as individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, pursuant to sections 161c, 161o, and 182 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commissions's
regulations in 10 CFR 2.204, Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton are hereby required to submit, either jointly or separately,
to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, within the timeframe
specified below, a statement in writing, under oath or affirmation, on the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Within 10 days of the date of this Order and DFI, inform the NRC, by letter, how each intends to comply with NRC requirements;
in particular, how you intend to maintain safe control over the byproduct material prior to the transfer of the material
to an authorized recipient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Within 15 days of the date of this Order and DFI, Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton shall provide a decommissioning plan for
NRC review and approval, which will meet the applicable requirements of 10 CFR 30.36.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Within seven days following transfer of the radioactive material, Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton shall provide: (1)
confirmation that the cobalt-60 and the krypton-85 have been transferred; and (2) a copy of the certification from
the authorized recipient that the byproduct material has been received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. At least two working days prior to the date of the transfer of the byproduct material, Mr. Tarr or Mr. Hamilton shall
notify Dr. Ronald Bellamy, Chief, Nuclear Materials Safety Branch, NRC, Region I, by telephone (610&hyph;337&hyph;5200)
so that the NRC may, if it elects, observe the transfer of the material to the authorized recipient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Within 30 days of the date of this Order and DFI, if Messrs. Tarr and Mr. Hamilton believe they do not have sufficient
funds to complete the transfer and decommissioning, they must provide specific evidence supporting such a claim
by submitting: (1) an estimate of the cost of the transfer and decommissioning, and the basis for the estimate, including
the license number and identity of the person who would perform the transfer and decommissioning; (2) written statements
from at least two banks stating that Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton could not qualify for a loan to pay for the transfer of
the byproduct materials and decommissioning of the facility; (3) copies of Federal income tax returns for the years
ending 1993, 1992, 1991, and 1990, for both Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton; (4) copies of all Bankruptcy Court submittals
for the Licensee, RCM Corporation and Cherokee Electronics Corporation; copies of all Bankruptcy Court decisions
related to the above corporations; and copies of all correspondence between these corporations and the NRC related
to the bankruptcy proceedings; and (5) a signed agreement to allow the NRC to receive Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton's credit
information from a credit agency. A SUBMITTAL OF EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT FUNDS DOES NOT EXCUSE
NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THIS ORDER.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Within 30 days of the date of this Order and DFI provide: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A list of all NRC licensees for whom Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton perform licensed activities, or with whom they are
associated in any other capacity;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. A statement as to why the NRC should have confidence that Messrs. Tarr and Hamilton would comply with NRC requirements
in the event that they perform licensed activities under another NRC license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. A statement as to why, in light of the facts set forth above, the NRC should not issue an Order to both Messrs. Tarr and
Hamilton, as individuals, prohibiting them from engaging in NRC-licensed activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information is needed to light of the continued violations of Commission requirements. Copies of the response
to this Demand for Information also shall be sent to the Regional Administrator, Region I, 475 Allendale Road, King
of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, and to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing your response, the NRC will determine whether further action is necessary to ensure compliance with
NRC requirements.

The NASD is proposing to amend the Prompt Receipt and Delivery of Securities Interpretation (``Interpretation'')
issued by the NASD Board of Governors under Article III, Section 1 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice. Specifically,
the NASD proposes to amend the Interpretation to require members to annotate their affirmative determinations as
to stock availability that are required to be made when effecting short sales. The following is the complete text of
the proposed rule change. (Additions are italicized and deletions are bracketed.)

 may accept a customer's purchase order for any security unless it has first ascertained that the customer placing
the order of its agent agrees to receive securities against payment in an amount equal to any execution, even though
such an execution may represent the purchase of only a part of a larger order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 the member or person associated with a member must make a notation on the order ticket at the time [he takes] the order

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
is taken
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 which reflects [his] 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
the
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 conversation with the customer as to the present location of the securities in question, whether they are in good deliverable
form and [his] 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
the customer's
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 ability to deliver them to the member within five (5) business days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
(B) To satisfy the requirement for an ``affirmative determination'' contained in subsection (b)(2) above for customer
and proprietary short sales, the member or person associated with a member must keep a written record which includes:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) if a customer assures delivery, the present location of the securities in question, whether they are in good deliverable
form and the customer's ability to deliver them to the member within five (5) business days; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) if the member of person associated with a member locates the stock, the identity of the individual and firm contacted
who offered assurance that the shares would be delivered or that were available for borrowing by settlement date and
the number of shares needed to cover the short sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The manner by which a member or person associated with a member annotates compliance with the ``affirmative determination''
requirement contained in subsection (b)(2) above (e.g., marking the order ticket, recording inquiries in a log,
etc.) is not specified by this Interpretation and, therefore, shall be decided by each member. However, an affirmative
determination and annotation of that affirmative determination must be made for each and every transaction since
a ``blanket'' or standing assurance that securities are available for borrowing is not acceptable to satisfy the
affirmative determination requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) No change.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The NASD is proposing an amendment to the Interpretation dealing with affirmative determinations made by members,
or those persons associated with such members, in connection with short sales. The proposed amendment to the Interpretation
establishes a requirement for a member to annotate the affirmative determination made before effecting a short sale.
The affirmative determination requirement already appears in the Interpretation and requires members or associated
persons to assure that securities are available to cover the short position. The Interpretation currently requires
the executing member or an associated person, in connection with any sale, to make an affirmative determination that
delivery will be received from the customer or that the securities will be able to be borrowed by settlement date. For
long sales, the affirmative determination is required to be noted on the order ticket at the time the order is placed.
However, the rule does not require that such determination be evidenced in any specific manner for short sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new rule would require members or associated persons to annotate, on the trade ticket or on some other record maintained
for that purpose by the member firm, the following information:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1. If a customer assures delivery, the member or associated person must annotate that conversation noting the present
location of the securities; whether the securities are in good deliverable form; and whether they will be delivered
to the firm within time for settlement; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If the member or associated person locates the stock, an annotation must be made that identifies the individual
and firm contacted who offered assurance that the shares would be delivered or were available for borrowing by settlement
date; and the number of shares needed to cover the short sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manner by which a member or person associated with a member annotates compliance with the ``affirmative determination''
requirement contained in subsection (b)(2) above (e.g., marking the order ticket, recording inquiries in a log,
etc.) is not specified by this Interpretation and, therefore, shall be decided by each member. However, an affirmative
determination and annotation of that affirmative determination must be made for each and every transaction since
a ``blanket'' or standing assurance that securities are available for borrowing is not acceptable to satisfy the
affirmative determination requirement.

requirements already imposed by the Interpretation and will enable the NASD to examine member compliance with the
requirements more effectively. Requiring firms to annotate each and every affirmative determination also will
make clear the NASD's longstanding policy that firms cannot rely on daily facsimile sheets of ``borrowable stocks''
to satisfy their affirmative determination requirements under the Interpretation. The annotation requirement
will preclude this practice as members or their associated persons will have to annotate the name of the person contacted
and number of shares for each short sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring annotation of affirmative determinations will also enhance the NASD's ability to examine for compliance
with various other NASD short sale rules including those found in Article III, Section 21 of the Rules of Fair Practice
(record keeping) and in the Uniform Practice Code, Section 71 (mandatory delivery requirements for certain restricted
securities). Further, the annotation requirement will assist in examining for compliance with the short sale rule
or ``bid test,'' recently approved by the SEC.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the NASD is proposing to amend the Interpretation to require that members or their associated persons
maintain a written record evidencing their compliance with the affirmative determination requirement for each
customer or proprietary short sale.

The NASD believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6) requires
that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in
regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities,
to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and in general
to protect investors and the public interest. The proposal will enable the NASD to more effectively enforce an already
existing provision of the Prompt Receipt and Delivery Interpretation requiring members or their associated persons
to affirmatively determine that shares relating to a short sale are available for delivery to a purchaser.

proposed rule change on October 25, 1993, pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act. On October 29, 1993, the Commission
issued an Order of Summary Abrogation abrogating the NASD's October 25th rule change. The Commission's Order of Summary
Abrogation suggested that the procedures provided by Section 19(b)(2) of the Act provide a more appropriate mechanism
for determining whether the NASD's rule change is consistent with the Act. Thus, on November 1, 1993, the NASD refiled
its rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(2).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following Interpretation of Article III, Section 1 of the Association's Rules of Fair Practice is adopted by the
Board of Governors of the Association pursuant to the provisions of Article VII, Section 3(a) of the Association's
By-Laws and Article I, Section 3 of the Rules of Fair Practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Interpretation is based upon the premise that members have an obligation to make a bona fide public distribution
at the public offering price of securities of a public offering which trade at a premium in the secondary market whenever
such secondary market begins (a ``hot issue'') regardless of whether such securities are acquired by the member as
an underwriter, as a selling group member, or from a member participating in the distribution as an underwriter or
a selling group or otherwise. The failure to make a bona fide public distribution when there is a demand for an issue
can be a factor in artificially raising the price. Thus, the failure to do so, especially when the member may have information
relating to the demand for the securities or other factors not generally known to the public, is inconsistent with
high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade and leads to an impairment of public
confidence in the fairness of the investment banking and securities business. Such conduct is, therefore, in violation
of Article III, Section 1 of the Association's Rules of Fair Practice and this Interpretation thereof which establishes
guidelines in respect to such activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the case of any other Interpretation issued by the Board of Governors of the Association, the implementation
thereof is a function of the District Business Conduct Committees and the Board of Governors. Thus, the Interpretation
will be applied to a given factual situation by individuals active in the investment banking and securities business
who are serving on these committees or on the Board. They will construe this Interpretation to effectuate its overall
purpose to assure a public distribution of securities for which there is a public demand.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Board of Governors has determined that a member who makes an allocation to a restricted person or account of an offering
that trades at a premium in the secondary market shall not be considered to have violated this Interpretation if it
cancels the allocations for such restricted person or account, prior to the end of the first business day following
the date on which secondary market trading commences and reallocates such security at the public offering price to
an non-restricted person or account.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Except as provided herein, it shall be inconsistent with high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable
principles of trade and a violation of Article III, Section 1 of the Association's Rules of Fair Practice for a member,
or a person associated with a member, to fail to make a bona fide public distribution at the public offering price of
securities of a public offering which trade at a premium in the secondary market whenever such secondary market begins
regardless of whether such securities are acquired by the member as an underwriter, a selling group member or from
a member participating in the distribution as an underwriter or selling group member, or otherwise. Therefore, it
shall be a violation of Article III, Section 1 for a member, or a person associated with a member, to:

(a) This prohibition shall not apply to a person in a limited registration category as that term is defined below; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The prohibition shall not apply to sales to a member of the immediate family of a person associated with a member
whose is not supported directly or indirectly to a material extent by such person if the sale is by a broker/dealer other
than that employing the restricted person and the restricted person has no ability to control the allocation of the
hot issue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) In the case of a foreign broker/dealer or bank which is participating in the distribution as an underwriter, the
agreement among underwriters contains a provision which obligates the said foreign broker/dealer or bank not to
sell any of the securities which it receives as a participant in the distribution to persons enumerated in paragraphs
(1) through (5) above, or in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph (6) hereof; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the case of sales to a foreign broker/dealer or bank which is not participating in the distribution as an underwriter,
the selling member:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
(i) Makes an affirmative inquiry of such foreign broker/dealer or bank as to whether the ultimate purchasers would
be persons enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (5) hereof and receives satisfactory assurance that the ultimate
purchasers of the securities so purchased would not be such persons, and that the securities would not be sold in a manner
inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph (6) hereof;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A recording is made on the order ticket, or its equivalent, or upon some other supporting document, of the name
of the person to whom the inquiry was made at the foreign broker/dealer or bank as well as the substance of what was said
by that person and what was done as a result thereof; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The order ticket, or its equivalent, is initialed by a registered principal of the member.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The obligations imposed upon members in their dealings with foreign broker/dealers or banks by this paragraph 8(b)
can be fulfilled by having the foreign broker/dealer or bank to which sales falling within the scope of this Interpretation
are made execute Form RF&hyph;1, or a reasonable facsimile thereof. This form, which gives a blanket assurance from
the foreign broker/dealer or bank that no sales will be made in contravention of the provisions of this Interpretation,
can be obtained at any District Office of the Association or at the Executive Office. The acceptance of an executed
Form FR&hyph;1, or other written assurance, by a member must in all instances be made in good faith. Thus, if a member
knows or should have known of facts which are inconsistent with the representations received, such will not operate
to satisfy the obligations imposed upon him by this paragraph.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
Scope and Intent of Interpretation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In addition to the obvious scope and intent of the above provisions, the intent of the Board of Governors in the following
specific situations is outlined for the guidance of members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
Limited Business Broker/Dealer
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The restrictions placed on associated persons pursuant to Paragraph 2 of the Interpretation shall not apply to persons
associated with NASD members engaged solely in the purchase or sale of either investment company/variable contracts
securities or direct participation program securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
Issuer Directed Securities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This Interpretation shall apply to securities which are part of a public offering notwithstanding that some or all
of those securities are specifically directed by the issuer to accounts which are included within the scope of paragraphs
(3) through (8) above. Therefore, if a person within the scope of those paragraphs to whom securities were directed
did not have the required
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [an] investment history [with the member or registered representative from whom they were to be purchased], the member
would not be permitted to sell him such securities. Also, the ``disproportionate'' and ``insubstantial'' tests
would apply as in all other situations. Thus, the directing of a substantial number of securities to any one person
would be prohibited as would the directing of securities to such accounts in amounts which would be disproportionate
as compared to sales to members of the public. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
If such issuer-directed securities are sold to the issuer's employees or directors or potential employees or directors
resulting from an intended merger, acquisition, or other business combination, such securities may be sold without
limitation as to amount and regardless of whether such employees have an investment history as required by the Interpretation;
provided, however, that in the case of an offering of securities for which a bona fide independent market does not exist,
such securities shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or hypothecated for a period of three months following
the effective date of the offering.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This Interpretation shall also apply to securities which are part of a public offering notwithstanding that some
of those securities are specifically directed by the issuer on a non-underwritten basis. In such cases, the managing
underwriter of the offering shall be responsible for insuring compliance with this Interpretation in respect to
those securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the above, sales of issuer directed securities may be made to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
non-employee/director
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 restricted persons without the required investment history after receiving permission from the Board of Governors.
Permission will be given only if there is a demonstration of valid business reasons for such sales (such as sales to
distributors and suppliers [or key employees], who are in each case incidentally restricted persons), and the member
seeking permission is prepared to demonstrate that the aggregate amount of securities so sold is insubstantial and
not disproportionate as compared to sales to members of the public, and that the amount sold to any one of such persons
is insubstantial in amount
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
; provided, however, that such securities shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or hypothecated for
a period of three months following the effective date of the offering.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Securities purchased pursuant to a stand-by arrangement shall not be subject to the provisions of the Interpretation
if the following conditions are met:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 -->
1. The stand-by agreement is disclosed in the prospectus.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The stand-by arrangement is the subject of a formal written agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The managing underwriter represents in writing that it was unable to find any other purchasers for the securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The securities purchased shall be restricted from sale or transfer for a period of three months.

Beneficial Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term beneficial interest means not only ownership interests, but every type of direct financial interest of any
persons enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (4) hereof in such account [, including, without limitation, management
fees based on the performance of the account].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Provided, however, that no restricted person shall be deemed to have a beneficial interest in an account receiving
a hot issue as a result of ownership of an interest in an investment partnership or corporation, or similar type account
(``investment entity''), if the following conditions are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The investment entity establishes a separate brokerage account, with a separate identification number, for its
new-issue purchases. At the end of each fiscal year, the general partner, or similarly situated party, will certify
in writing to its independent certified public accountants that: (a) all hot issues purchased by the investment entity
were placed in this new-issue account; and (b) that the participants in the new-issue account are not restricted persons
under this Interpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Prior to the execution of the initial hot issue transaction, the investment entity's accountant or attorney will
provide a written representation that complies with paragraph B of the section of this Interpretation entitled ``Investment
Partnerships and Corporations.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. As part of its audit procedure for the investment entity, the indendent certified public accountant will confirm
in writing to the investment entity that all allocations for the new-issue account were made in accordance with the
provisions of the applicable investment entity agreement that restricts participation in hot issue purchases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The investment entity will maintain in its files copies of the certifications, representations, and confirmations
referred to in paragraphs (1)&hyph;(3) above for at least three years following the last purchase of a hot issue for
the new-issue account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The investment entity will accept investment funds from other investment entities only if such other accounts
provide the same documentation and assurances described in paragraphs (1)&hyph;(4) above that restricted persons
will not participate in the purchase of hot issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The certifications and documents required in paragraphs (1)&hyph;(3) above shall be provided to the member holding
such account at such time as these certifications and documents are filed with the investment entity and its independent
certified public accountant and, the member shall make such documentation available to the NASD upon request.

Venture Capital Investors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This Interpretation shall not prohibit the sale of hot issues in an initial public offering to a person restricted
under the Interpretation or to an account in which such restricted person has a beneficial interest (a ``Venture Capital
Investor'') if the following conditions are met:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Venture Capital Investor has held an ownership interest in the company issuing the hot issue securities for
a period of one year prior to the effective of the public offering;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The acquisition of the hot issue securities in the public offering does not increase the percentage equity ownership
of the Venture Capital Investor in the company above that held three months prior to the filing of the registration
statement in connection with the offering; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Venture Capital Investor received no special terms in connection with the purchase; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The securities purchased shall be restricted from sale or transfer for a period of three months following the conclusion
of the offering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
Violations by Recipient
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In those cases where a member or person associated with a member has been the recipient of securities of a public offering
to the extent that such violated the Interpretation, the member or person associated with a member shall be deemed
to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of the Rules of Fair Practice and this Interpretation as well as the member
who sold the securities since their responsibility in relation to the public distribution is equally as great at that
of the member selling them. In those cases where a member or a person associated with a member has caused, directly or
indirectly, the distribution of securities to a person falling within the restrictive provisions of this Interpretation
the member or person associated with a member shall also be deemed to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of the
Rules of Fair Practice and this Interpretation. Receipt by a member or a person associated with a member of securities
of a hot issue which is being distributed by an issuer itself without the assistance of an underwriter and/or selling
group is also intended to be subject to the provisions of this Interpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
Violations by Registered Representative Executing Transaction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The obligation which members have to make a bona fide public distribution at the public offering price of securities
of a hot issue is also an obligation of every person associated with a member who causes a transaction to be executed.
Therefore, where sale are made by such persons in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this Interpretation,
such persons associated with a member will be considered equally culpable with the member for the violations found
taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the particular case under consideration.

Disclosure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The fact that a disclosure is made in the prospectus or offering circular that a sale of securities would be made in a
manner inconsistent with this Interpretation does not take the matter out of its scope. In sum, therefore, disclosure
does not affect the proscriptions of this Interpretation.

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
(i) Purpose of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Overview of Free-Riding and Withholding Interpretation. The purpose of the Interpretation is to protect the
integrity of the public offering system by ensuring that members make a bona fide public distribution of ``hot issue''
securities and do not withhold such securities for their own benefit or use the securities to reward other persons
who are in a position to direct future business to the member. Hot issues are defined by the Interpretation as securities
of a public offering while trade at a premium in the secondary market whenever such trading commences. The Interpretation
prohibits members from retaining the securities of hot issues in their own accounts and prohibits members from using
sales of such securities to directors, officers, employees and associated persons of members and other broker/dealers.
It also restricts member sales of ``hot issue'' securities to the accounts of specified categories of persons, including
among others, senior officers of banks, insurance companies, registered investment companies, registered investment
advisory firms and other persons within such organizations whose activities influence or include the buying or selling
of securities. These basic prohibitions and restrictions are also made applicable to sales by members of hot issue
securities to accounts in which any such persons may have a beneficial interest and, with limited exceptions, to members
of the immediate family of those persons restricted by the Interpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Rule proposal background
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. At its May 1992 meeting, the Board of Governors appointed a special committee (the ``Committee'') to examine the
Interpretation to determine if the Interpretation's restrictions, definitions and obligations are relevant in
today's securities markets. The Committee was comprised of representatives of the Association's National Business
Conduct, Corporate Financing and Insurance Affiliated Members Committees as well as members of the NASD Board of
Governors. The Board also asked the Committee to examine various interpretative issues that had been raised with
the NASD. The Committee met numerous times from May 1992 until April 1993 and received input and suggestions, both
in writing and in person, from members, issuers, law firms, the NASD's Legal Advisory Board, and the staff of various
NASD departments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1993, the NASD published for comment proposed modifications to the Interpretation based on its review and
suggestions received. The NASD received 36 comment letters on the proposed modifications. The Committee considered
the comments and made final recommendations to the National Business Conduct Committee (``NBCC'') in November 1993.
The Board considered and approved the NBCC's recommendations on November 14, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change includes language clarifications to facilitate understanding of the Interpretation's
application, as well as substantive modifications. The following discusses the substantive modifications proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Substantive proposed modifications
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The NASD is proposing several substantive modifications to the Interpretation, including changes in connection
with limited business broker/dealers, investment partnerships and corporations, stand-by arrangements, venture
capital investors, securities offerings covered by the Interpretation, and issuer-directed securities. The NASD
believes that the proposed substantive changes clarify the scope of the Interpretation and remedy certain unintended
effects the Interpretation has had in its present form. Specifically, the NASD believes that the Interpretation
has prohibited transactions which do not implicate the Interpretation's objective of a bona fide distribution of
hot issue securities to the public, and may have created unduly burdensome restrictions and expense for NASD members
and their customers. Thus, the NASD believes that the proposed changes, described further below, appropriately
restrict prohibited persons from receiving hot issues without engendering unintended restrictions inconsistent
with the purpose of the Interpretation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Stand-by arrangements. If an offering begins trading at a premium when the secondary market begins, the Interpretation's
restrictions are implicated and may affect the successful completion of the offering by prohibiting the sale to stand-by
purchasers, due to a person restricted under the Interpretation having a beneficial interest in the stand-by account.
The NASD believes that securities purchased pursuant to a stand-by arrangement (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
an agreement to purchase securities not purchased during the offering period) by a restricted account should not
be subject to the Interpretation if the conditions proposed are met. The NASD believes that the proposed conditions
(prospectus disclosure, a formal agreement, absence of any other purchaser and a three month holding period) remedy
any potential derogation from the Interpretation that such a sale could cause, while facilitating a bona fide distribution
of the securities offered.

Of course, any resales by the stand-by purchasers would need to be conducted in compliance with all applicable regulatory
requirements including prospectus delivery pursuant to Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Definition of immediate family. The Interpretation presently restricts immediate family members of persons
enumerated in Paragraph 2 (persons associated with broker/dealers), and Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Interpretation
(persons having a connection to the offering and individuals related to banks, insurance companies and other institutional
type accounts) from participating in hot issue distributions. The Interpretation defines immediate family members
very broadly and includes such persons as father-, mother-, brother- and sister-in-law. An immediate family member
of a person associated with a broker/dealer is prohibited from purchasing hot issues to the same degree as the associated
person, unless it can be demonstrated that the associated person does not contribute directly or indirectly to the
support of the immediate family member. In the latter circumstance, the immediate family member of the associated
person may purchase a hot issue under the same conditions as those persons restricted pursuant to Paragraphs 3 and
4 of the Interpretation. Specifically, such persons may purchase hot issues if: (1) The securities were sold to such
persons in accordance with their normal investment practice with the member making the distribution; and (2) the
securities sold are insubstantial and not disproportionate in amount as compared to sales to members of the public
and that the amount sold to any one such person is insubstantial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that in its present form, the immediate family member provisions often place inequitable restrictions
on a person with a fairly attenuated connection to a restricted person named in the Interpretation (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the sister-in-law of a bank vice-president), and often result in unduly burdensome compliance difficulties for
members monitoring whether such persons are restricted or become restricted. The NASD believes that the proposed
modifications to the immediate family member provisions will ensure that those persons with a substantial nexus
to a restricted person will be similarly restricted under the Interpretation, provide a clearer test for NASD members
in determining whether such persons are restricted, and eliminate the Interpretation's application to persons
not intended to be restricted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed modifications would:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) retain the investment history exemption, and expand it to include the use of investment history at firms other
than the member making the allocation. The burden of obtaining such information would remain with the firm making
the sale;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) eliminate the immediate family restrictions on persons other than those associated with broker/dealers (categories
3 and 4 referenced above) and the Interpretation would only apply to the enumerated individuals in those categories
and to persons who are supported directly or indirectly to a material extent by the restricted person;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) with respect to persons associated with broker/dealers, continue to apply the immediate family restrictions
to persons supported by the restricted individual and to allocations by the restricted individual's firm, but would
no longer prohibit sales to non-supported family members of a person associated with a broker/dealer by a broker/dealer
that does not employ the restricted person, where the restricted person has no ability to control the allocation of
the hot issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There would continue to be a violation if it could be determined that the restricted person has a beneficial interest
in the account to which an allocation was made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Venture capital investors. The NASD believes that bona fide venture capital investors should be allowed to purchase
a hot issue to maintain their percentage ownership in an entity, notwithstanding that the venture capital investor
may be a restricted person, or that such person may have a beneficial interest in the venture capital account. The NASD
notes that the venture capital investor often plays a pivotal role in the continued viability of an entity prior to
its public offering, and that such an investor should be allowed to maintain his or her own ownership interest after
the entity completes its public offering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The venture capital investor, in order to purchase the hot issue without implicating the Interpretation's restrictions,
would have to meet the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) one year of preexisting ownership in the entity;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) no increase in the investor's percentage ownership above that held for the three months prior to the filing of a
registration statement in connection with the initial public offering;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) a lack of special terms in connection with the purchase; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) the venture capital investor shall not assign, sell, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the securities
for a period of three months following the effective date of the registration statement in connection with the offering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the conditions imposed on the venture capital investor ensure that the securities may be purchased
by a bona fide venture capital investor who has had an on-going interest in an entity, and protect against any attempt
to circumvent the Interpretation's restrictions by investing in an entity shortly before its public offering.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Investment partnerships and corporations. The Interpretation, under ``Investment Partnerships and Corporations,''
generally disallows sales of a hot issue to an investment partnership or corporation, or similar account (``investment
partnership'') if a restricted person has a beneficial interest in the entity. Thus, an investment partnership with
several limited partners would be ``tainted'' due to the limited partnership interest of the restricted person.
In August 1992 and October 1993 Notices to Members, the NASD announced it was going to allow investment partnerships,
on an interim basis, to use a ``carve out'' mechanism to prevent restricted persons with an interest in an investment
partnership from participating in hot issue allocations. This ``carve out'' mechanism requires the NASD member
making such allocation to set up a separate account for these transactions and obtain from the investment partnership
and its accountants documentation that indicates that the restricted persons are prevented from participating
in a hot issue allocation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the carve-out methodology is the most equitable and appropriate approach for investment partnerships
in which restricted persons have a beneficial interest, and that the carve-out procedure should be codified as proposed
under the Beneficial Interest section of the Interpretation. The carve-out procedure would not allow a person restricted
under the Interpretation to receive a hot issue allocation inconsistent with the Interpretation's provisions;
but would also not inequitably penalize those not restricted under the Interpretation due to their interest in an
investment partnership in which a restricted person also has an interest. A typical scenario is where a limited partnership
with a large number of limited partners is restricted under the Interpretation because one of the limited partners
is an officer of an insurance company, and therefore restricted under Paragraph 4 of the Interpretation. Rather than
restricting the whole limited partnership, the carve-out procedure would allow the limited partnership to purchase
the hot issue by properly allocating the hot issue away from the restricted limited partner according to the specified
requirements proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the NASD believes that a beneficial interest, as defined under the Interpretation, should not be created
by the receipt of a management fee based on the performance of an account. The NASD believes that investment partnerships
and other similar accounts typically require that the management fee structure of such accounts include a performance-based
component. Thus, an investment advisor restricted under Paragraph 4 of the Interpretation could restrict an entire
investment partnership, in which no restricted persons have an interest, based solely on the investment advisor
receiving a fee based on the performance of the securities in the investment partnership account. The Beneficial
Interest provision of the Interpretation is intended to address those accounts in which a restricted person has a
substantive, albeit not necessarily direct ownership, interest that should be appropriately restricted. The NASD
believes that the receipt of a performance-based fee, without the existence of any other beneficial interest, should
not create such an interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Definition of public offering. In its present form, the Interpretation's definition of a public offering includes
virtually any and all distributions of securities, whether registered or unregistered under the Securities Act.
The NASD has found that the definition has had the unintended effect of implicating the Interpretation's restrictions
for bona fide private placements of securities which do not present the potential abuses that the Interpretation
is intended to guard against. The NASD believes that the proposed modification to the definition, which in essence
does not apply the Interpretation to a traditional private placement of securities, is appropriate because such
distributions generally are limited in scope and have holding periods placed on the privately placed securities.
Thus, the NASD believes that such placements should not be within the purview of the Interpretation in that distribution
is limited and that the potential for restricted persons to purchase the securities and resell or ``flip'' them in
a short period of time is limited due to the resale restrictions placed on such offerings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Associated person definition. Article I, Section (m) of the NASD By-Laws defines a ``person associated with a member''
to include a partner of a broker/dealer and any person who is directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by such
member, whether or not such person is registered with the Association. The NASD has found that a certain degree of confusion
exists as to the status of passive investors in broker/dealers, such as broker/dealer limited partners, equity owners,
or subordinated lenders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes, that under certain circumstances, such persons should not be considered persons associated with
a broker/dealer due to their limited, passive investment in a broker/dealer. Thus, the NASD has proposed that if a
person owns or has contributed 10% or less to a broker/dealer's capital, such person should not be construed to be an
associated person; provided that, such ownership interest is a passive investment, the person does not receive hot
issues from the member in which she has the interest, and that the broker/dealer is not in a position to direct hot issues
to the person. The NASD believes that the limitations placed on such persons in order not to be considered associated
persons will prevent the same from attempting to use their ownership interests in a broker/dealer to effect the purchase
of hot issues, and circumvent the Interpretation's objective of a bona fide distribution of a hot issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Persons associated with limited business broker/dealers. Similar to the status of persons with a limited ownership
interest in a broker/dealer, the NASD believes that persons associated with certain broker/dealers that transact
a limited securities business should also not be restricted as other associated persons under Paragraph 2 of the Interpretation.
Specifically, the NASD proposes that persons associated with broker/dealers whose business is limited to direct
participation programs or investment company/variable product securities not be restricted under the Interpretation
to the same extent as those persons associated with broker/dealers with a more comprehensive securities business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Typically, a broker/dealer's business is limited pursuant to a restrictive agreement executed by the member as a
condition to its membership in the Association. In that persons associated with such limited broker/dealers are
not in a position to sell, distribute, or withhold hot issue securities, the NASD does not believe that such persons
would be in a position to inhibit a bona fide distribution of a hot issue security. The NASD notes that the proposed modification
applies only to a person associated with such a limited broker/dealer, and not to the broker/dealer itself. The NASD
does not believe that it is appropriate for any NASD member to purchase a hot issue security for its own account, regardless
of the extent of its securities business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Issuer directed securities. Presently, an employee of an issuer, who also is restricted under the Interpretation,
must receive permission from the NASD Board of Governors in order to purchase hot issue securities of its employer,
if the employee does not have the requisite investment history with the NASD member making the securities distribution.
For example, an employee of a manufacturing company who is married to the senior officer of a bank would be restricted
under the Interpretation because he or she is the immediate family member of a restricted person under Paragraph 3
of the Interpretation. Under the proposed changes to Paragraph 3 of the Interpretation, the employee would still
be restricted if the senior officer of the bank directly or indirectly supports the employee. If permission is granted
by the board of governors, the employee is allowed to purchase the securities of the employer without meeting the investment
history requirement, but the amount purchased would still have to meet the insubstantial and not disproportionate
tests described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that it is inequitable to impose such restrictions on employees of issuers who are in most cases tangentially
restricted under the Interpretation, in connection with their purchase of securities issued by their employer.
The NASD notes that issuer-directed share programs are viewed as a valuable tool in employee development and retention,
and does not believe that the objectives of the Interpretation are furthered by imposing essentially the same restrictions
on such purchases as those not involving an employer/employee relationship. Thus, the proposed modifications to
the Issuer Directed Securities section of the Interpretation will allow employees of issuers to purchase hot issue
securities of the employer under the same terms and conditions as persons associated with NASD members are permitted
in connection with purchases of securities issued by the member, pursuant to an exemption provided in Section 13 of
Schedule E to the NASD's By-Laws.

Cancellation safe harbor. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD believes that it is appropriate to clarify in the Interpretation that it will not be a violation if a NASD member
makes an allocation of a hot issue to a restricted person or account, so long as the member cancelled the trade and reallocated
the security at the public offering price to an unrestricted account, prior to T+1 of the initial transaction. The
NASD believes that the clarification will remedy any concerns caused by inadvertent violations of the Interpretation
that are corrected by the NASD member making the distribution. Sales following cancellation would need to be made
in compliance with applicable laws, including section 5 of the Securities Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act in
that the proposed changes to the Interpretation will promote just and equitable principles of trade by facilitating
the bona fide distribution of hot issue securities to the public, and protect against the receipt of hot issues by persons
restricted under the Interpretation. Further, the NASD believes that the proposed changes and clarifications to
the Interpretation are consistent with Section 15A(b)(9) in that they alleviate certain inequities caused by the
Interpretation, which imposed burdens on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes
of the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Association received 36 letters commenting on Notice To Members 93&hyph;40 (the ``Notice''), the proposed amendments
to the Interpretation. The commenters include the American Bar Association, the Securities Industry Association,
twelve law firms, nine investment advisers/asset managers, seven broker/dealers, three insurance companies,
two associations, and one CPA firm. Below is a summary of the more significant and/or recurring issues raised in the
letters and the NASD's position in connection with the same. The topics addressed follow the order in which they were
presented in the Notice, beginning at page 258. Following that discussion are topics not included in the Notice, but
raised in the comment letters.

Securities to be Covered
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the solicitation of comments on debt securities, those who did comment recommended that rated debt
securities, especially corporate debt securities, be excluded from the Interpretation. The commenters maintained,
in general, that the pricing of such securities is made in conjunction with a comparison to U.S. Treasury securities,
that their price fluctuates relative to interest rates, and that such securities are typically considered fungible
by investors, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
investors look for a certain grade of debt, and do not focus on the issuer, as in equity offerings. Thus, they maintained
that the abuses that the Interpretation seeks to prevent are not evident in rated debt offerings, and that the Interpretation's
methodology is inapplicable to the trading of such securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD has considered that it does not typically bring enforcement actions in this area, but has concluded that the
continued coverage of debt securities is warranted for purposes of deterring any potential future problems in this
area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those who commented generally supported the proposal. One commenter maintained that the five-month holding period
was too long in that it went beyond the period in which the purchaser should be exposed to the market risk for the securities.
It proposed a holding period of no longer than three months, which it maintains is adequate time for the market to establish
some equilibrium for the security. Another commenter believed that it is unclear to whom an underwriter has to represent
that it was unable to find any other purchaser for the securities, and suggested that a representation in the prospectus
should suffice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the various holding periods under the Interpretation and in the Free-Riding provisions of
Schedule E to the By-Laws dealing with offerings by members of their own securities should be uniform and has therefore
proposed a three month holding period.

Cancellation of Trades as ``Safe Harbor''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter believed that there would not be any implications under SEC Rule 10b&hyph;6 for the proposed safe harbor
so long as the cancellation and reallocation was completed before settlement date. A different commenter suggested
that any concerns with Rule 10b&hyph;6 could be remedied by obtaining a no-action letter from the SEC. Another commenter
suggested that any notice of cancellations and reallocations would have to be given to the restricted purchaser no
later than the day after purchase, and a further commenter maintained that the proposal was too reactive. It suggested
that the NASD establish a procedure where hot issues were characterized as such before the distribution via indications
of interest, so as to prevent sales to restricted accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD notes that for purposes of Rule 10b&hyph;6, a distribution includes ``the entire process by which in the course
of a public offering the block of securities is dispensed and ultimately comes to rest in the hands of the investing
public.''
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, a distribution continues if a broker-dealer withholds any part of an offering in proprietary or nominee accounts
and later sells those securities to the public after secondary trading has begun.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, a cancellation of a bona fide purchase order will not reopen the distribution where there is no reason for
the underwriter to believe that the purchase order would be cancelled.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Whether a particular cancellation and reallocation for purposes of compliance with the Interpretation will raise
an issue under Rule 10b&hyph;6 will depend upon the facts and circumstances involved in that cancellation and reallocation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Those who commented strongly supported the lifting of the immediate family restrictions on persons restricted under
Paragraphs three and four of the Interpretation. One commenter expressed concern that the retention of the immediate
family restriction in connection with allocations by the broker/dealer that employs the restricted person (as opposed
to allocations by broker/dealers that do not employ the restricted person) creates a new category of restricted persons
that may prove burdensome for the member who is making the distribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD does not believe that any new restricted category is being created and believes that the proposed modifications
are appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Several of the commenters supported the proposed exemption as described in the Notice. In addition, virtually all
proposed that the exemption be expanded to apply to all persons, notwithstanding their level of registration, if
they are associated with broker/dealers that do a limited business. They maintained generally that such representatives
are proscribed from doing any securities business which is beyond the scope of the limited broker/dealer's prescribed
business (e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
investment company securities), and maintained that the potential for abuse by one that has a general license is unlikely.
Some of the commenters contended that limited broker/dealer representatives often have a Series 7 (general securities
representative) license in order to comply with state law, and one commenter maintained that the exemption as proposed
would create a disincentive for persons with limited registrations from seeking further registration/education.
Various commenters believed that a firm-based exemption should include the firms listed in the Notice as well as firms
that do not underwrite or distribute initial public offerings, merger and acquisition boutique firms that do not
trade, and private placement firms.

The NASD does not believe that it is appropriate for any NASD member to purchase a ``hot issue'' for its own account and
that the categories of exemption should not be expanded to include member firms or expanding the categories to be exempted.
The NASD, however, agrees with the suggestion of several commentators that this exemption be expanded to cover all
persons associated with direct participation program or investment company/variable product broker/dealers
regardless of their registration status. The Association has considered that the NASD's Membership Committee encourages
members to qualify their registered persons through Series 7 even if they are going to do limited activities and that
these individuals should not be penalized for holding such licenses.

Investment Partnerships and Corporations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were several comments on the proposed changes, and opposition to applying the Interpretation to investment
partnerships and corporations in general. First, all those who commented on substituting a certified public account's
certification in lieu of an attorney opinion letter, including the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(``AICPA''), maintained that the certification would not work because the certification is more legal than factual,
and because the analysis for certification would not comply with the ``Attestation Standards'' necessary for a CPA
to render such a certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the proposed amendments, several of the Commenters had general policy concerns with investment
partnerships and corporations. Most believed that the Interpretation should not apply to partnerships because:
(1) partnerships typically represent interests of individual investors, thus the objectives of a bona fide distribution
are furthered by distribution to partnerships; and (2) the Interpretation unfairly discriminates between mutual
fund type accounts and partnerships because of size, maintaining that there is no need for delineation because most
limited partners have no control over the purchase and sale of securities for the account and do not exercise any discretion.
One commenter maintained that precedent for such a position could be found in rules and interpretations under &sect;16
of the Exchange Act, which does not require officers to disgorge profits resulting from transactions through investment
partnerships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, most maintained that receipt of performance-based fees alone should not restrict an account, maintaining
that partnership law typically requires that a general partner/manager maintain some 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 equity position in the partnership. In addition, one commenter believed that the responsibility for opening up a
separate hot issue account should rest with the member. Several of the commenters suggested various 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provisions which would allow the participation by investment partnerships in hot issues, notwithstanding the presence
of a restricted person(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD has considered the comment of the AICPA that accountants cannot provide the certification proposed in the
Notice and therefore has proposed that a written representation of an accountant 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 counsel be substituted for the accountant's certification. This written representation would replace the existing
``opinion of counsel'' under paragraph B of the Investment Partnerships and Corporations section of the Interpretation.
The NASD believes that the proposed ``written representation'' satisfies the Association's objective of ensuring
that Members seek the counsel of an independent, qualified third party in meeting their obligations under the Interpretation,
while not imposing any requirements that are unduly burdensome or unnecessarily problematic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD has also considered various comments that indicate that more trustees and institutional investors are demanding
that performance-based fees be charged rather than asset based fees for money management services and therefore
has proposed that performance-based fees be deleted from the definition of beneficial interest under the Interpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to other comments, the NASD believes that securities placed into a carved out ``hot issue'' account should
remain in that account until sold. The Association does not believe that such securities should be subject to ``journaling''
to the regular account after a specified time period in that such a procedure would be difficult to monitor.

Foreign Mutual Funds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board of Governors solicited comment as to exempting foreign mutual funds from the Investment Partnerships and
Corporations section of the Interpretation, similar to the exemption provided for sales to investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. One commenter suggested that the exemption apply only to foreign
investment companies which are subject to regulation under foreign laws expressly designed for investment companies
and/or satisfy minimum standards that the NASD would establish. Another commenter expressed disappointment that
the Notice did not address the application of the Interpretation to foreign broker/dealers in general.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD is concerned as to whether the Association can adequately determine whether a foreign country's mutual fund
regulation is similar to our own. The NASD has concluded, therefore, that no provisions should be adopted at this time.
If, however, the NASD can develop a substantial equivalence standard, the issue could be revisited.

Venture Capital Investors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those who commenter generally supported the exemption, and proposed certain revisions. One commenter maintained
that allowing the venture capital investor to purchase only up to his percentage ownership for the prior year was too
limiting in that a venture capitalist could make a crucial contribution after the one year mark, well before the issuer
goes public, and should be able to recover that contribution in stock. Another commenter believed that the requirement
that no special terms be received by the purchasers should be qualified to limit that to ``special terms from the member''
because a venture capitalist typically enters into special arrangements with the issuer which could be construed
as prohibited special terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes it is an appropriate requirement that a venture capital investor have an ownership interest in the
entity for at least one year prior to the offering; however, in response to the comments, the NASD believes that it is
appropriate to use three months before the date that the registration statement is filed as the date to be used for calculating
the investors' existing ownership interest. The NASD, in keeping with its prior recommendation, believes that a
three month holding period for the securities received in the distribution is appropriate.

Ownership Interests in a Broker/Dealer
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commentators asked for advice on when passive investors who are limited partners, equity owners or subordinated
lenders of a broker/dealer would be construed as associated persons under the Interpretation. In other words, what
ownership or contribution percentage would trigger associated person status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that if the person owns or has contributed 10% or less to the firm's capital, does not receive hot issues
from the member in which he has the interest, and that member is not in a position to direct hot issues to the investor,
then the NASD should not construe the investor to be an associated person solely by virtue of the investment in the broker/dealer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Category 4 Restricted Persons
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commentators asked whether managers/advisors of hedge funds, investment partnerships or of other similar
entities would be construed as a restricted person under Paragraph four of the Interpretation (sales to the senior
officer of a bank, investment company or other institutional type account).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that managers of investment partnerships or corporations, hedge funds, and other similar accounts
are clearly involved with the buying or selling of securities for an institutional type account and, as such, are restricted
under Paragraph four of the Interpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Private Placements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commentators sought advice on how the Interpretation should be applied to members who receive securities
of an issuer in a private placement. The definition of ``public offering'' as currently set forth in the Interpretation
is comprehensive. The definition includes all distributions ``*&blank;*&blank;* of securities whether underwritten
or not; whether registered, unregistered or exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, and whether
they are primary or secondary distributions, including intrastate distributions and Regulation A issues, which
sell at an immediate premium, in the secondary market.'' As such, the definition by its terms covers these private
placements. Such distributions may involve securities which are either registered or unregistered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the definition of public offering is unnecessarily broad and does not believe that the Interpretation
should cover traditional ``private placements'' of unregistered securities. Thus, the NASD has proposed a definition
of a public offering consistent with the definition provided in Schedule E to the Association's By-Laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Issuer Directed Exemption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commentators requested that employees of an issuer or the issuer's parent who are restricted persons be exempt
from the Interpretation when purchasing shares of their employer or its parent. Currently, such exemptions can only
be granted on a case-by-case basis by the NASD Board of Governors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD agrees that the issuer directed share exemption should be modified to allow restricted employees to purchase
under the same terms and conditions as employees of member firms do under Schedule E of the By-Laws, thereby eliminating
the need for applications to the NASD.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 under the Act, proposes to adopt Floor Procedure Advice F&hyph;24, AUTO&hyph;X
Contra-Party Participation (The Wheel), in order to implement an automated mechanism for assigning floor traders
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, specialists and Registered Option Traders (``ROTs'')), on a rotating basis, as contra-side participants to AUTO&hyph;X
orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advice F&hyph;24 codifies Wheel eligibility and the procedures by which Wheel participants must sign on/sign off.
It also establishes the rotation upon which trades will be allocated among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wheel participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of the Advice summarizes AUTO&hyph;X eligibility by stating that public customer orders up to the maximum
permissible size would be eligible for AUTO&hyph;X.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Paragraph (b) establishes that the Wheel will assign contra-parties by rotating through the list, in consecutive
order, trade by trade. Paragraph (c) requires specialists to participate on the Wheel and permits ROTs to participate
in assigned issues. It also limits ROTs to Wheel participation in one Wheel assignment area, which is defined as two
contiguous quarter turrets at any one given time.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 ROTs must sign onto the Wheel in person on the trading floor from terminals designated by the Exchange and may sign on
in individual options. ROTs who sign on before 9:30 a.m. may remain on the Wheel for the entire trading day; those who
sign on after 9:30 a.m. are eligible for Wheel participation beginning at 12:30 p.m. After 12:30 p.m., no new sign ons
are permitted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c) also governs signing off the Wheel. An ROT may sign off the Wheel at any time during the trading day, which
becomes effective for all listed options. However, an ROT may sign off twice each trading day and still be eligible
to sign on again that day; after the third sign off, that ROT is no longer eligible for the Wheel that day. ROTs who sign
on for the half-day session beginning at 12:30 p.m. may only sign off once and still be eligible to sign on again that
day. In addition, no two associated or dually affiliated ROTs may be on the Wheel for the same option at the same time.
Paragraph (d) permits a Floor Official to modify the aforementioned sign on/sign off procedures in extraordinary
circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) details the rotation of trades among Wheel participants. Specifically, the first ten contracts of
any AUTO&hyph;X order are assigned to a single Wheel participant, with the specialist receiving the first execution
of the day in each respective listed option. For those AUTO&hyph;X orders greater than ten contracts, each additional
ten-lot or remaining portion thereof is assigned to the next individual Wheel participant. The next order is similarly
assigned, beginning with the next participant after the last to receive an execution. If there are five or more ROTs

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed
rule change, and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and
(C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to increase the efficiency and liquidity of order execution through AUTO&hyph;X
by adopting a ``Wheel'' for the automated assignment of floor traders as contra-parties to incoming AUTO&hyph;X
orders. The Phlx believes that the Wheel will make AUTO&hyph;X more efficient, as contra-side participation will
be assigned automatically and no longer entered manually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AUTO&hyph;X system is the automatic execution feature of the Exchange's Automated Options Market (``AUTOM'')
system.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 AUTO&hyph;X provides customers with automatic executions of eligible option orders at displayed markets.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 AUTO&hyph;X orders are currently given executions automatically and immediately. ROTs are added later as contra-side
participants to such orders with manual keypunch entries, which can cause delays and errors in processing executions.
The proposed Wheel is designed to eliminate manual keypunching of contra-side participant information relating
to AUTO&hyph;X executions and the errors that sometimes result from such keypunching. It also provides a rotation
schedule by which floor traders will automatically be assigned as the contra-party to AUTO&hyph;X orders and will
do so in a manner that reduces the number of contra-side participants, which in most cases will be reduced to one contra-side
per trade.

AUTOM is an on-line system that allows electronic delivery of options orders from member firms directly to the appropriate
specialist on the Phlx options trading floor, with electronic confirmation of order executions. On March 31, 1988,
the Commission first approved the Phlx's operation of the AUTOM system on a pilot basis. Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 25540 (March 31, 1988), 53 FR 11390.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, floor trader contra-side participation currently defaults to the account of the specialist if no step
is taken to manually add the participation of a ROT. ROTs are eligible for participation when they have established
priority or parity at the execution price.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Consequently, before contra-side information can be added, the trading crowd has to resolve among itself which floor
trader(s) had priority or parity at the execution price. Quite often, several floor traders are on parity, thus requiring
keypunch entries for each such trader. The more contra-side participants which must be added to a trade, the more of
a delay there is in processing the participant information to the trade and the more the process becomes prone to keypunch
errors and additional manual paperwork.

Currently, if one or more ROTs have priority or parity, the order will be split as evenly as possible between all such
ROTs and the specialist.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Wheel will automatically include eligible ROTs in AUTO&hyph;X executions and specify how such trades will be
split among the specialist and ROTs. The specialist and any signed on ROTs will be listed on the Wheel, and contra-side
participation of AUTO&hyph;X orders will then be assigned to them in circular rotation with each ten lot or order (whichever
is smaller) constituting an assignment. The specialist receives the first trade of the day in each respective option.
Thereafter, the Wheel turns to assign trades to ROTs in an order standardized for that day on a random basis.

The first ROT is selected randomly from all ROTs that sign on prior to 9:30 a.m. All other ROTs are prioritized for receipt
of orders based on the badge numbers following sequentially the first ROT's badge number. If other ROTs sign on for
the 12:30 p.m. session, the priority list is rerandomized for that session.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, if specialist S and ROTs R, O, and T are on the Wheel in XYZ option, the first order for 9 contracts is assigned
automatically to S. The next order, which is for 25 contracts, is assigned ten each to R and O, and five to T. The third
order, for 20 contracts, is assigned ten contracts to S and ten to R. If there are five or more ROTs signed onto the Wheel,
the specialist participates in the first trade of the day and thereafter receives every fifth execution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believe that the proposed AUTO&hyph;X Wheel and corresponding Advice are intended to facilitate orderly
transactions in AUTO&hyph;X, with full trading crowd participation. The sign on/sign off requirements, including
the assigned option and Wheel assignment area requirements, are intended to ensure that the ROT is present and actively
awaiting AUTO&hyph;X orders in those options in which AUTO&hyph;X executions are to be manually received.

 in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, as well as to protect investors and the public interest by promoting ROT participation as contra-parties
to AUTO&hyph;X trades and reducing opportunities for keypunching errors through increased automation.

1. The Fund is a Maryland corporation registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end, diversified management investment
company. G.R. Phelps is the investment adviser for the Fund. The Fund currently consists of six separate portfolios,
(individually a ``Portfolio'' and collectively, the ``Portfolios''): The Money Market Portfolio, the Government
Securities Portfolio, the Income Portfolio, the Total Return Portfolio, the Growth Portfolio, and the International
Equity Portfolio. Each Portfolio has its own investment objective, or objectives, and policies. Presently, shares
of the Fund are sold to Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company (``CML'') to be credited, as appropriate, to its
Panorama Separate Account, CML Variable Annuity Account A, CML Variable Annuity Account B, and CML Accumulation
Annuity Account E. Each of these separate accounts established by CML funds benefits under variable annuity contracts
issued by CML. Shares of the Fund are also sold to C.M. Life Insurance Company (``C.M. Life''), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of CML, to be credited to its Panorama Plus Separate Account to fund benefits under variable annuity contracts issued
by C.M. Life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Shares of the Fund, may, in the future, be sold to other separate accounts established by CML or C.M. Life or to other
issuers of variable annuity or variable life insurance contracts. Specifically, the Fund intends to offer its shares
to separate accounts of any interested insurance company, including insurance companies unaffiliated with CML,
in order to fund variable annuity contracts, single premium variable life insurance contracts, scheduled premium
variable life insurance contracts, and/or flexible premium variable life insurance contracts (referred to collectively
as ``variable contracts''). Such Participating Insurance Companies will establish their own Separate Accounts
and will design their own variable contracts.

It is anticipated that Participating Insurance Companies will rely on Rules 6e&hyph;2 or 6e&hyph;3(T) under the
1940 Act with respect to their scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts, respectively, although some
Participating Insurance Companies also may rely on individual exemptive orders. The use of a common management investment
company as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts
is referred to herein as ``mixed funding.'' The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment
medium for separate accounts of unaffiliated insurance companies is referred to herein as ``shared funding.'' Applicants
request an order of the Commission exempting the Participating Insurance Companies and their Separate Accounts
(and, to the extent necessary, any principal underwriter and depositor of such an Account) from Sections 9(a), 13(a),
15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(B)(15) under the 1940 Act, to the extent
necessary to permit mixed and shared funding.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) provides the exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act that
are discussed below only if the separate account is organized as a unit investment trust, all the assets of which consist
of the shares of one or more registered management investment companies which offer their shares exclusively to variable
life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurer. Thus, those exemptions under
Rule 6e&hyph;2 are not available if a separate account invests in a fund engaged in mixed and/or shared funding. Rule
6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) provides similar exemptions, but only if the separate account is organized as a unit investment
trust, all the assets of which consist of the shares of one or more registered management investment companies which
offer their shares exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life insurance company,
offering either scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts or flexible premium variable life insurance
contracts, or both; or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of
an affiliated life insurance company, or which offer their shares to any such life insurance company in consideration
solely for advances made by the life insurer in connection with the operation of the separate account. Thus, the exemptions
set out in Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) are available if the underlying fund is engaged in mixed funding, but are not available
if the fund is engaged in shared funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act provides, among other things, that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment
adviser or principal underwriter of any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company
is subject to a disqualification enumerated in Sections 9(a)(1) or (2) of the 1940 Act. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(i)
and (ii) and Rules 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(i) and (ii) under the 1940 Act provide exemptions from Section 9(a) under
certain circumstances, subject to the limitations on mixed and shared funding imposed by the 1940 Act and the rules
thereunder. These exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals
or companies that directly participate in the management of the underlying management company. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii)
and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) each provide a partial exemption from Sections 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940
Act to the extent those sections have been deemed by the Commission to require ``pass-through'' voting with respect
to an underlying fund's shares.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants state that the partial relief granted in Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) from the
requirements of Section 9 of the 1940 Act, in effect, limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance
with Section 9 to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of Section 9. Applicants states that
those 1940 Act Rules recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act to apply the provisions of Section 9(a) to the many individuals in a large
insurance company complex, most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in
that organization. Applicants state that it is unnecessary to apply Section 9(a) to individuals in various unaffiliated
Participating Insurance Companies (or affiliated companies of Participating Insurance Companies) that may utilize
the Fund as the funding medium for variable contracts. According to Applicants, there is no regulatory purpose in
extending the Section 9(a) monitoring requirements because of mixed or shared funding. The Participating Insurance
Companies are not expected to pay any role in the management or administration of the Fund. Moreover, those individuals
who participate in the management or administration of the Fund will remain the same regardless of which Separate
Accounts or insurance companies use the Fund. Applicants argue that applying the monitoring requirements of Section
9(a) because of investment by other insurers' Separate Accounts would be unjustified and would not serve any regulatory
purpose. Further, the increased monitoring costs would reduce the net rates of return realized by contractowners.

4. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) under the 1940 Act assume the existence of a pass-through
voting requirement with respect to management investment company shares held by a separate account. The Application
states that pass-through voting privileges will be provided with respect to all variable contractowners so long
as the Commission interprets the 1940 Act to require pass-through voting privileges for variable contractowners.
Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) under the 1940 Act provide exemptions from the pass-through
voting requirement with respect to several significant matters, assuming the limitations on mixed and shared funding
imposed by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder are observed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) under the 1940 Act give the Participating Insurance Companies
the right to disregard voting instructions of contract holders. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii)(A) 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) each provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contractowners with respect
to the investments of an underlying fund, or any contract between a fund and its investment adviser, when required
to do so by an insurance regulatory authority (subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(7)(ii)(A)
of Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) under the 1940 Act). Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii)(B) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) each provide that the insurance company may disregard voting instructions of contractowners if the contractowners
initiate any change in the underlying investment company's investment policies, principal underwriter, or any
investment adviser (subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii), (b)(7)(ii)(B), and (b)(7)(ii)(C) of Rules
6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) under the 1940 Act). Applicants represent that these rights do not raise any issues different
from those raised by the authority of state insurance administrators over separate accounts. Under Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)
and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15), an insurer can disregard contractowner voting instructions only with respect to certain
specified items. Applicants also note that the potential for disagreement among Participating Separate Accounts
is limited by the requirements in Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) that the participating insurance company's disregard
of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific good faith determinations.

6. The Application states that making the Fund available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance
companies to offer variable contracts, and that this should result in increased competition with respect to both
variable contract design and pricing, which can be expected to result in more product variation and lower charges.
Applicants believe that mixed and shared funding should provide several benefits to variable contractowners. Mixed
and shared funding would eliminate a significant portion of the costs of establishing and administering separate
funds. Mixed and shared funding also would provide the Fund with a larger pool of funds, thereby promoting economies
of scale and permitting increased safety through greater diversification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicants see no significant legal impediment to permitting mixed and shared funding. Separate accounts organized
as unit investment trusts historically have been employed to accumulate shares of mutual funds which have not been
affiliated with the depositor or sponsor of the separate account. Applicants do not believe that mixed and shared
funding will have any adverse Federal income tax consequences.

Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the requested order is granted, Applicants consent to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A majority of the Board of Directors of the Fund (the ``Board'') shall consist of persons who are not ``interested
persons'' of the Fund, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, and as modified by any
applicable orders of the Commission, except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death, disqualification,
or bona-fide resignation of any director or directors, then the operation of this condition shall be suspended: (a)
For a period of 45 days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the Board; (b) for a period of 60 days if a vote of shareholders
is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies; or (c) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by order
upon Application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Board will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests
of the contractowners of all Separate Accounts investing in the Fund. A material irreconcilable conflict may arise
for a variety of reasons, including: (a) An action by any state insurance regulatory authority; (b) a change in applicable
Federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action
or interpretative letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (c) an
administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (d) the manner in which the investments of any series
are being managed; (e) a difference in voting instructions given by variable annuity contractowners and variable
life insurance contractowners; or (f) a decision by an insurer to disregard the voting instructions of contractowners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Participating Insurance Companies and G.R. Phelps will report any potential or existing conflicts to the Board.
Participating Insurance Companies and G.R. Phelps will be responsible for assisting the Board in carrying out the
Board's responsibilities under these conditions by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary
for the Board to consider any issues raised. This includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by each Participating
Insurance Company to inform the Board whenever contractowner voting instructions are disregarded. The responsibility
to report such information and conflicts to and to assist the Board will be a contractual obligation of all insurers
investing in the Fund under their agreements governing participation in the Fund and these responsibilities will
be carried out with a view only to the interests of the contractowners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If it is determined by a majority of the Board, or a majority of the disinterested directors of the Board, that a material
irreconcilable conflict exists, then the relevant insurance companies, at their expense and to the extent reasonably
practicable (as determined by a majority of the disinterested directors), shall take whatever steps are necessary
to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict, up to and including: (a) Withdrawing the assets allocable
to some or all of the Separate Accounts from the Fund or any Portfolio and reinvesting such assets in a different investment
medium, including another Portfolio of the Fund, or submitting the question as to whether such segregation should
be implemented to a vote of all affected contractowners and, as appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate
group (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
annuity contractowners or life insurance contractowners of one or more Participating Insurance Companies) that
votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to the affected contractowners the option of making such a change;
and (b) establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account. If a material irreconcilable
conflict arises because of a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard contractowner voting instructions,
and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, then the insurer may be required,
at the Fund's election, to withdraw the insurer's Separate Account's investment in the Fund and no charge or penalty
will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a Board determination
of a material irreconcilable conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action shall be a contractual obligation
of all Participating Insurance Companies under their agreements governing participation in the Fund and these responsibilities
will be carried out with a view only to the interests of contractowners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this Condition 4, a majority of the disinterested members of the Board shall determine whether or not
any proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict, but, in no event, will the Fund or
G.R. Phelps be required to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract. No Participating Insurance Company
shall be required by this Condition 4 to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract if any offer to do so
has been declined by vote of a majority of the contractowners materially adversely affected by the material irreconcilable
conflict.

5. The Board's determination of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and its implications shall be
made known in writing promptly to all Participating Insurance Companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all variable contractowners
so long as the Commission continues to interpret the 1940 Act as requiring pass-through voting privileges for variable
contractowners. Accordingly, Participating Insurance Companies will vote shares of the Fund held in their Separate
Accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely-received from contractowners. Each Participating
Insurance Company will vote shares of the Fund held in the Participating Insurance Company's Separate Accounts for
which no voting instructions from contractowners are timely-received, as well as shares of the Fund which the Participating
Insurance Company itself owns, in the same proportion as those shares of the Fund for which voting instructions from
contractowners are timely-received. Participating Insurance Companies shall be responsible for assuring that
each of their Separate Accounts participating in the Fund calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with
other Participating Insurance Companies. The obligation to calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent
with all other Separate Accounts investing in the Fund shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance
Companies under their agreements governing participation in the Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Fund will comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act requiring voting by shareholders, and, in particular, the
Fund will either provide for annual meetings (except to the extent that the Commission may interpret Section 16 of
the 1940 Act not to require such meetings) or comply with Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act (although the Fund is not one of
the trusts described in Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act), as well as with Section 16(a) of the 1940 Act and, if and when applicable,
Section 16(b) of the 1940 Act. Further, the Fund will act in accordance with the Commission's interpretation of the
requirements of Section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of directors and with whatever rules the Commission
may promulgate with respect thereto.

8. The Fund shall disclose in its prospectus that (a) the Fund is intended to be a funding vehicle for all types of variable
annuity and variable life insurance contracts offered by various insurance companies, (b) material irreconcilable
conflicts possibly may arise, and (c) the Fund's Board of Directors will monitor events in order to identify the existence
of any material irreconcilable conflicts and to determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to any such
conflict. The Fund will notify all Participating Insurance Companies that Separate Account prospectus disclosure
regarding potential risks of mixed and shared funding may be appropriate.

9. If and to the extent that Rule 6e&hyph;2 and Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) under the 1940 Act as amended, or Rule 6e&hyph;3 under
the 1940 Act is adopted, to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the 1940 Act, or the rules promulgated thereunder,
with respect to mixed or shared funding, on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted
in the order requested in this Application, then the Fund and/or Participating Insurance Companies, as appropriate,
shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T), or Rule 6e&hyph;3, as such
rules are applicable.

10. The Participating Insurance Companies and/or G.R. Phelps, at least annually, shall submit to the Fund's Board
of Directors such reports, materials, or data as the Board reasonably may request so that the directors of the Fund
may fully carry out the obligations imposed upon the Board by the conditions contained in this Application and said
reports, materials, and data shall be submitted more frequently if deemed appropriate by the Board. The obligations
of the Participating Insurance Companies to provide these reports, materials, and data to the Fund's Board of Directors,
when the Board so reasonably requests, shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies
under their agreements governing participation in the Fund.

to determining the existence of a conflict, notifying Participating Insurance Companies of a conflict, and determining
whether any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board
or other appropriate records, and such minutes or other records shall be made available to the Commission upon request.

1. JHVLICO, a wholly-owned subsidiary of John Hancock, is a stock life insurance company chartered under the laws
of Massachusetts in 1979. Account U, which is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust, is a separate
investment account of JHVLICO. Account U funds scheduled premium variable life insurance policies and single premium
variable life insurance policies issued by JHVLICO in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;2 of the 1940 Act. JHVLICO and its Account
U also intend to issue certain flexible premium variable life insurance policies (the ``Account U Policies''), in
reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) under the 1940 Act.

2. John Hancock is a mutual life insurance company chartered under the laws of Massachusetts in 1862. Account UV, which
is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust, is a separate investment account of John Hancock. Account
UV funds: (i) Flexible premium variable life insurance policies based on the joint lives of two insureds, issued by
John Hancock in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T); and (ii) scheduled premium, annual premium and single premium policies
issued by John Hancock in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;2 under the 1940 Act. John Hancock and its Account UV intend to issue
certain flexible premium variable life insurance policies (the ``Account UV Policies), in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)
under the 1940 Act. (The Account U Policies and the Account UV Policies are substantially identical and are referred
to herein collectively as the ``Policies.''

The Applicants have obtained exemptive relief from the Commission to the extent necessary to permit Account U and
Account UV to support variable life insurance policies issued in reliance on both Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T)
under the 1940 Act. Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19898 (Nov. 24, 1993)(order), and 19817 (Oct. 27, 1993)(notice),

3. John Hancock is a registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer, and is the principal underwriter
for Account U, Account UV and the Policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Like other variable life insurance policies issued in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T), the Policies provide for
premium flexibility, together with a death benefit and a surrender value that may increase or decrease daily depending,
in part, on the investment performance of an underlying mutual fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Each year, as specified in the Policy, John Hancock and JHVLICO (collectively, the ``Companies'') will deduct
from each premium payment a charge equal to 4% of premiums paid in such year up to one ``target premium'', to cover sales
expenses. No sales charge will be deducted from premiums paid in excess of one target premium in any Policy year. The
Companies intend to make this deduction only in the first ten Policy years, but the Companies reserve the right to deduct
this charge for a longer period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. For Policies having a current sum insured (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
face amount) of at least $250,000, the Companies will waive one-half of any sales charge that otherwise would be deducted
from premium payments. The continuation of this waiver is not guaranteed, and the Companies may withdraw it at any
time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Companies will deduct a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') only if a Policy is surrendered in full
or stays in default past its grace period. This charge is computed as a percentage of base Policy target premiums (target
premiums less any component thereof that is attributable to additional rider benefits), according to the following
schedule:

9. The Companies also will deduct from each premium payment a charge, currently equal to 1.25% of each premium payment,
to cover the estimated cost of the federal income tax treatment of the Policies' deferred acquisition costs_commonly
referred to as the ``DAC tax.''
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>

charge, an issue charge, a maintenance charge, an insurance charge, a charge for mortality and expense risks, a charge
for any extra mortality risks, a charge for any optional rider benefits and a charge for partial withdrawals. The Companies
also reserve the right to impose a charge for taxes other than the DAC tax charge, if such taxes are incurred in the future.

11. The Applicants represent that, except to the extent that exemptive relief has been obtained from the Commission
pursuant to this or any other applicable exemptive application, all charges under the Policies will comply with all
of the applicable limitations, terms, conditions and requirements of the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder.
To the extent permitted by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, the sales and administrative charges under the Policies
may be reduced in the case of sales to a class of associated individuals or to a trustee, employer, or similar entity
where the Companies anticipate that the sales to members of the class will result in lower than normal sales or administrative
expenses.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 27(a)(3) of the 1940 Act generally provides that the amount of sales charge deducted from any of the first
twelve monthly payments on a periodic payment plan certificate may not exceed proportionately the amount deducted
from any other such payment, and that the amount deducted from any subsequent payment may not exceed proportionately
the amount deducted from any other subsequent payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. With limited exceptions, Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(ii) grants an exemption from Section 27(a)(3), provided
that the proportionate amount of sales charge deducted from any payment during the contract period does not exceed
the proportionate amount deducted from any prior payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. With respect to sales charges deducted from other than premiums, Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(d)(1) provides in pertinent
part, and with limited exceptions, that Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(ii) shall be deemed to be satisfied if the amount
of sales load deducted pursuant to any method permitted under Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(d) does not exceed the proportionate
amount of sales load deducted prior thereto pursuant to the same method.

A. Front-End Sales Charge Limitation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Companies will not impose the 4% front-end sales charge upon the amount of any premium payments received in any
Policy year that is in excess of the target premium for that year. Consequently, the front-end sales charge may apply
to some premium payments and not to others. The Applicants request an exemption from Section 27(a)(3) and Rules 6e&hyph;3(T)
(b)(13)(ii) and (d)(1) (also referred to herein collectively as the ``stair-step provisions'') to the extent necessary
to permit this sales charge structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.The Applicants represent that the sales charge deducted from the first target premium paid under a Policy in any
Policy year, as compared with the absence of such a charge deducted from premiums in excess thereof, in part reflects
the fact that lower overall distribution costs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, commissions paid to sales persons) are incurred in connection with such excess premiums over the life of the Policies.
To deduct a sales charge from the excess premiums would generate more revenue than either Company believes is necessary
to adequately defray such expenses. The Applicants submit that the structure of the front-end sales load under the
Policies provides a significant benefit to Policy owners by passing through to them lower distribution costs with
respect to excess premiums.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The Applicants further submit that it would not be in the interest of Policy owners to require the deduction from excess
premiums of a sales charge that is higher than the Applicants deem necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicants submit that the flexibility in the timing and amount of premium payments afforded Policy owners are
desirable features. The Applicants also note that, subject to the other exemptive relief requested in the application,
the Policies would continue to comply with all of the other sales charge limitations and requirements in Rule 6e&hyph;3(T),
even if the front-end sales charge were deducted from all premium payments. Such a front-end charge structure, however,
also would clearly be less favorable to Policy owners than that provided under the Policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. In addition, the Applicants represent that the proposed sales load structure would not deduct large amounts of
front-end sales charges so early in the life of the Policy that an investor redeeming in the early periods would recoup
little of his or her investment, a perceived abuse of periodic plan certificates identified by Commission staff in
past no-action letters.

4. The Applicants represent that the sales charge structure under the Policies is relatively straightforward and
easily understood, as compared with that of many other variable life insurance policies that are currently being
offered. The Applicants further represent that owners of Policies will benefit from the sales charge structure of
the Policies, and that the prospectuses for the Policies will contain disclosure informing owners how to minimize
sales charge deductions from premiums paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Applicants submit that the Commission has indicated that the policies underlying the ``stair-step'' requirement
in Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) would not be contravened by fluctuations in sales load which result from factors beyond the control
of Policy issuers (such as the Companies),
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 and that this principle is equally applicable in the present circumstance.

B. Front-End Sales Charge Reduction for Large Policies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each Company will waive a portion of any sales charge that otherwise would be deducted from premiums paid on a Policy
with a current sum insured of at least $250,000. The continuation of this waiver is not contractually guaranteed,
and the waiver may be withdrawn or modified by each Company at any time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Under certain circumstances, the Policy owner may take action that results in a Policy's sum insured being reduced
after issue. For example, under certain of the available death benefit options, a partial withdrawal of the Policy's
cash surrender value reduces the sum insured on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Because the waiver of a portion of the front-end
sales charge applies only when the current sum insured is at least $250,000, and because the waiver is not guaranteed,
it is possible that the reduction could apply at some times with respect to a given Policy and not at subsequent times
with respect to the same Policy. The Applicants request an exemption from Section 27(a)(3) and Rules 6e&hyph;3(T)
(b)(13)(ii) and (d)(1) to the extent necessary to permit this sales charge structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Applicants submit that reduction of these charges will not unduly complicate the sales charge structure, and
represent that the operation of the sales charge reduction will be fully disclosed in the prospectuses pertaining
to the Policies. The Applicants submit that the reduction will clearly be of benefit to those Policy owners to whom
it applies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. CDSC Structure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The maximum CDSC under the Policies is 26% of premiums paid in each of the first three Policy years that are not in excess
of one base Policy target premium. Premiums paid in excess of one year's base Policy target premium in any of the first
three Policy years are not subject to any CDSC. Thus, the CDSC may apply to some premium payments made during the first
three Policy years, but not to others. This could be interpreted to be prohibited by Section 27(a)(3) and Rules 6e&hyph;3(T)
(b)(13)(ii) and (d)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Applicants represent that they could have structured their 26% CDSC to apply to all premiums up to three base
Policy target premiums, regardless of when paid. The Applicants further represent that although that structure
would comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder (subject only to the other exemptive
relief requested herein), it would result in a higher CDSC for Policy owners who pay excess premiums in at least one
of the first three Policy years, or who pay a total of less than three base Policy target premiums during the first three
Policy years. The Applicants submit that the CDSC structure under the Policies is more favorable to purchasers than
would be the case if, as generally contemplated by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T), the amount of sales charge with respect to any
premium payments did not depend on the year in which such payments were made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Applicants represent that the CDSC with respect to the first base Policy target premium in each of the first three
Policy years, as compared with the absence of such a charge with respect to any premiums in excess thereof paid during
those first three years, in part reflects the fact that lower overall distribution costs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, commissions paid to sales persons) are incurred in connection with such excess premiums. The Applicants submit
that to impose a CDSC upon such excess premiums paid during any of the first three Policy years would generate more revenues
than either Company believes is necessary to adequately defray such expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Applicants submit that all of the arguments set forth above concerning the inapplicability of the front-end
sales charge to premiums paid in excess of specified amounts during any Policy year equally support the inapplicability
of the CDSC to premiums paid in excess of one base Policy target premium during any of the first three Policy years. The
Applicants submit that Policy owners will benefit from the sales charge structure, and represent that the prospectuses
for the Policies will contain disclosure informing owners how to minimize the amount of CDSC with respect to the premiums
they pay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. If a Policy were surrendered during the second Policy year, the maximum total sales charge (including both the 4%
front-end charge and the 26% CDSC) would be 60% of base Policy target premiums paid to date. Imposition of the full CDSC
in such a case could cause the total sales charges to exceed the amount permitted by Rule 6e(3)(T)(b)(13)(v)(A), as
applied pursuant to Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(d)(1)(i)_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. To ensure compliance with the ``refund'' requirements that are, in effect, imposed by Rules 6e&hyph;3(T) (b)(13)(ii)
and (d)(1) in the event of a surrender during the second Policy year, the Companies will agree in the Policies to waive
a portion of the CDSC, equal to 20% of premiums paid in the second Policy year, up to one base Policy target premium.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Although this waiver formula has been designed to ensure that no violation of Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(v)(A)
will occur, the formula can result in the imposition of a CDSC that is lower than what the rule would permit. To that extent,
the expiration of the waiver after the end of the second Policy year could be deemed to cause an increase in the CDSC that
would be prohibited under the stair-step provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Applicants represent that the CDSC never increases as a percentage of base Policy target premiums paid in each
year, except to the extent that the expiration of the partial waiver of the CDSC after the end of the second Policy year
is deemed to cause such an increase. The Applicants further represent that the sole purpose of the partial waiver is
to implement the sales load refund mandated by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(B)(13)(v)(A) and (d)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The Applicants submit that it would be anomalous if the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder were to prohibit
the expiration of the partial waiver after the end of the second Policy Year_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at the very time when, under the specific terms of Rule 6e&hyph;3(T), the Companies' obligations to make the waiver
expires. The Applicants further submit that the fact that the waiver formula can result in a lower CDSC than might be
permitted under Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) is a clear benefit to Policy Owners.

Applicants' Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in pertinent part, that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally
or unconditionally exempt any person, security of transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or
transactions, from any provision of the 1940 Act, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the 1940 Act. For the reasons expressed in this application, the Applicants submit that the requested
exemption from Section 27(a)(3) of the 1940 Act and Rules 6e&hyph;3(T) (b)(13)(ii) and (d)(1) thereunder meet the
standards of Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act.

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. All of the applicants other than Lord Abbett are registered open-end management investment companies that offer
shares in one or more series. The term ``Fund'' refers to any series of such an applicant that offers shares in multiple
series, or to such an applicant that offers shares only in one series. Lord Abbett serves as investment adviser to each
Fund, and acts as principal underwriter of the shares of each Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Shares of Money Market Fund and the Funds comprising Securities Trust are offered at net asset value. Shares of the
other Funds (each an ``FESC Fund'') are offered to investors at their net asset value plus a front-end sales charge.
However, there is no front-end sales charge on reinvestment of dividends and distributions, and sales that involve
an investment above $1 million.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Also, shares of the FESC Funds and Money Market Fund may be exchanged freely, one for the other, without a sales charge,
except on exchanges from Money Market Fund into an FESC Fund when Money Market Fund shares were originally purchased
without a sales charge. In addition, shares of the Securities Trust Funds are freely exchangeable with shares of other
Securities Trust Funds but are not currently exchangeable for shares of any other Fund.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
To reach the $1 million breakpoint, investments in all Funds except Money Market Fund (unless such investment has
been exchanged into Money Market Fund from an FESC Fund) are taken into account, as are amounts covered by statements
of intention with any FESC Funds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Each applicant has adopted a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (the ``Plan''). Although shareholders have approved each Plan,
some of the Plans are not yet effective. The Plans of the FESC Funds except Investment Trust provide that, when shares
are sold above $1 million, the applicable Fund will pay at the time of sale to Lord Abbett in its capacity as principal
underwriter a one-time distribution fee equal to 1% of the net asset value of the shares sold. The Plan of Investment
Trust provides that Investment Trust will pay, with respect to sales above $1 million, a one-time distribution fee
of 1% of the first $3 million, plus .50% of the next $7 million, plus .25% of the remainder, of the net asset value of shares
sold. The Plans of all FESC Funds also provide for annual service fees payable by the FESC Fund to Lord Abbett in its capacity
as principal underwriter of up to .25% of the average daily net asset value of shares held in broker-dealer accounts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Plan of Money Market Fund does not impose a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee at the time of sale, but provides for payment of
an annual rule 12b&hyph;1 service fee equal to .15% of the average daily net asset value of shares held in broker-dealer
accounts; however, this fee has been suspended. The Plans of the Securities Trust Funds provide that such Funds pay
Lord Abbett a distribution fee and service fee of .75% and .25%, respectively, of the net asset value of all shares sold
other than in connection with the reinvestment of dividends or other distributions, or the exchange of shares from
another Securities Trust Fund. The Plans also provide for annual distribution and service fees, beginning one year
after shares are sold, equal to .75% and .25%, respectively, of the average daily net asset value of shares held in broker-dealer
accounts.

6. Under the requested order, a Fund will impose a CDSC of 1% upon the redemptions of shares (a) of an FESC Fund when shares
were purchased at or above $1 million and redeemed within 24 months following the month the shares were purchased,
or (b) of a Securities Trust Fund when shares are redeemed within 12 months following the month of their purchase. The
CDSC is received and retained by the Fund that paid the initial rule 12b&hyph;1 fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In no event does the CDSC exceed 1% of the lesser of the net asset value of the shares redeemed or the original cost of
the shares. No CDSC is imposed when the investor redeems shares (a) derived from increases in net asset value per share,
(b) where no rule 12b&hyph;1 fee was paid on issuance (including shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends
and capital gains distributions), or (c) which, together with exchanged shares, have been held continuously for
a certain number of months following the month of purchase (24 months with respect to shares of an FESC Fund, and 12 months
with respect to shares of a Securities Trust Fund). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In determining whether a CDSC is payable, it is assumed that a redemption is made first of shares originally not subject
to a CDSC and then of shares subject to a CDSC. With respect to shares subject to a CDSC, it is assumed that the shares held
the longest are the first to be redeemed. No CDSC is charged upon exchanges of shares between (a) FESC Funds, (b) an FESC
Fund and Money Market Fund, or (c) Securities Trust Funds. If the shares being exchanged are subject to a CDSC, the CDSC
and the original acquisition dates carry over to the shares being acquired in the exchange. Applicants will comply
with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act with regard to all exchanges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The Funds may waive the CDSC upon redemptions by tax-qualified plans under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code
due to plan loans, hardship withdrawals, death, retirement, or separation from service with respect to plan participants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Upon their redemption, shares will be subject to the CDSC schedule in effect at the time of their purchase, except
that applicants may apply a CDSC schedule that has been changed subject to the purchase of shares if such changes confer
a benefit to the shareholder (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Applicants' Legal Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants submit that the requested exemption to permit the Funds to implement the proposed CDSC is appropriate,
in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the
policy and provisions of the Act. The proposed CDSC arrangements will provide shareholders the option of having greater
investment dollars working for them from the time of their purchase than if a sales load had been imposed at such time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants believe that the purposed CDSC waiver is fair, equitable, and in the public interest and the interest
of shareholders because the redeeming shareholders are members of a class favored under federal tax and securities
laws.

If the requested order is granted, applicants expressly agree to the following condition: Applicants will comply

is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

Applications' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each of the Nuveen Fund is either a Maryland corporation, a Minnesota corporation, or a Massachusetts business
trust, and is requested under the Act as an open-end management investment company. Several of the Nuveen Funds have
multiple series, each of which has separate investment objectives and policies, and separate assets. All of the Nuveen
Funds currently charge varying front-end sales charges in connection with the purchase of their shares (ranging
from 4.75% to .50%, depending on the amount of purchase).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Adviser, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Distributor, acts as investment adviser for each of the Nuveen Funds.
Each of the Nuveen Funds has entered into an investment management contract with the Adviser under which the Adviser
provides the fund with investment management and administrative services. The Distributor, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the John Nuveen Company, acts as the principal underwriter of the shares of the Nuveen Funds, and distributes shares
directly to the public and through selected broker-dealers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants propose to adopt a multiple class distribution plan (the ``Multiple Class Plan'') for shares of the
Funds. Under the Multiple Class Plan, each Fund initially will offer three classes of shares, which would represent
interests in the same portfolio of investments and be identical in all respects, except for sales charges, class designations,
the allocation of distribution expenses, service expenses and certain other expenses (as set forth in condition
1 below) applicable to such class (``Class Expenses''), voting rights, exchange privileges, and conversion features.
The Multiple Class Plan would be implemented by designating all currently issued and outstanding shares of each Fund
as Class R shares, and creating to additional classes of shares of each Fund: Class A shares and Class C shares. The Funds
also may offer an additional class of shares designated as Class B.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Class R shares will be available for purchase by (a) unitholders of Nuveen-sponsored unit investment trusts (``UITs'')
who, on or prior to the effective date of the Multiple Class Plan, have purchased such UITs and elected to reinvest distributions
from such UITs in shares of a Fund, (b) holders of Class R shares of a Fund who elect to reinvest Fund dividends and capital
gain distributions in Class R shares of that Fund, and (c) certain identified categories of investors described from
time to time in the Funds' prospectuses, such as employees of the Funds' authorized dealers or members of their immediate
families, bank trust departments investing funds in a fiduciary capacity pursuant to investment discretion, and
certain specified categories of financial advisers on behalf of their customers. Purchases described in clauses
(a) through (c) above will not be subject to any sales charge, distribution fee, or service fee under a Rule 12b&hyph;1
Plan or otherwise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Class A shares will be subject to a front-end sales charge and a plan to be adopted pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 (a ``Rule
12b&hyph;1 Plan'') providing for a service fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of average daily net assets of Class A shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Class C shares will not be subject to any sales charge, but will be subject to a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan that will provide
for a distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75%, and a service fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of average daily
net asset of Class C shares. Class C shares automatically will convert to Class A shares a specified number of years
after purchase, pursuant to the conversion feature described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Funds may from time to time create one or more additional classes of shares, the terms of which may differ from
the classes of shares described above. These may include classes subject to a CDSC, as well as classes subject to combinations
of front-end sales charges, distribution fees and service fees different from those of Class A shares, Class C shares,
and Class R shares. A Fund may, for example, offer a class or classes of shares, with or without front-end sales charges,
that are subject to a service fee under a service plan substantially identical to a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan, but not adopted
under rule 12b&hyph;1 (a ``Shareholder Service Plan'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The provision of services under a Shareholder Service Plan or Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan (collectively, the ``Plans'')
will augment (and not be duplicative of) the services to be provided to a Fund by its distributor, adviser, transfer
agent, custodian, and other providers of recordkeeping services. Applicants will comply with Article III, Section
26, of the Rules of Fair Practice of the NASD regarding asset-based sales charges and service fees.

 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30897 (July 7, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. A Fund may determine, on a Fund-by-Fund basis, to offer investors a class or classes of shares subject to a CDSC and
distribution and service fees under a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan or a Shareholder Service Plan (``Class B shares''). In
the event that a Fund decides to issue Class B shares, such shares would be offered for sale without the imposition of
a sales charge at the time of purchase. An investor's proceeds from a redemption of Class B shares made within a specified
period after purchase generally would be subject to a CDSC payable to the Distributor. The CDSC typically would be
established in an initial amount that could range from 1% to 4% (but could be higher or lower) on shares redeemed during
the first year after purchase, and typically would be reduced at a rat of either 1% of .5% per year for each subsequent
year of the applicable CDSC period, so that redemptions of shares held after that period would be subject to a CDSC.
Redemptions of Class B shares held by identified categories of investors also would not be subject to a CDSC. Class
A shares following a specified number of years after purchase.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Except as noted below, each class of shares generally may be exchanged only for shares of a class with similar characteristics
in another Fund. Class R shares may be exchanged for Class A shares of a Fund at any time at the option of a Class R shareholder,
provided the current net asset value of the shareholder's Class R shares is at least $1,000. Shares of any class of a
Fund, including a class with a CDSC feature, may be exchanged for shares of any money market funds sponsored by Nuveen
that do not impose a sales charge and may not be subject to a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan or Shareholder Service Plan (``Money
Market Exchange Shares'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Additionally, exchanges may be permitted among dissimilar classes at the discretion of the directors of a Fund if
a shareholder ceases to be eligible to purchase shares of the original class by reason of a change in the shareholder's
status. All exchanges will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of imposing any applicable CDSC on redemptions of Money Market Exchange Shares (and applying any applicable
conversion feature), the period during which the shareholder held the exchanged shares would be counted. A Fund may
elect not to count the period during which the shareholder held the Money Market Exchange Shares. In the event that
a Fund elected not to count the period during which the shareholder held the Money Market Exchange Shares, the amount
of any applicable CDSC would be reduced in accordance with rule 11a&hyph;3(b)(5)(i)(A) under the Act by the amount
of any Plan payments to which the Money Market Exchange Shares may be subject.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Shares of one class (the ``Purchase Class'') will automatically convert at their net asset value to shares of another
class with different features (the ``Target Class'') after the expiration of a specified period, subject to terms
fully disclosed in a Fund's prospectus. This conversion feature will apply to convert Class C shares (and Class B Shares,
if issued) to Class A shares, and may apply to convert shares of other classes established in the future to Class A shares.
For purposes of the conversion, all Purchase Class shares in a shareholder's Fund account that were acquired through
the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of such shares (and which had not yet converted)
will be considered to be held in a separate subaccount. Each time any Purchase Class shares in the shareholder's Fund
account are converted, an equal proportion of shares then in the subaccount also will convert, and will not longer
be considered held in the subaccount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Any conversion of shares will be subject to the continuing availability of an opinion of counsel or a private letter
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the conversion of shares would not constitute a taxable
event under federal income tax law. Conversion of shares might be suspended if such an opinion or ruling were no longer
available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Expenses attributable to a Fund but not to a particular series thereof (``Fund Expenses'') will be borne by shareholders
of the Fund on the basis of relative aggregate net assets of the Fund without regard to class. In the case of a Fund that
has multiple series, Fund Expenses will first be allocated among the series, based on the relative aggregate net assets
of such series. Expenses that are attributable to a particular series, but not a particular class thereof would be
borne by each class on the basis of the relative aggregate net assets of the classes. Each class will bear the Class Expenses
and payments under any rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan and/or Shareholder Service Plan (``Plan Payments'') applicable to such
class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Applicants propose that the Funds be permitted to impose a CDSC on redemptions of Class B shares. The amount of the
CDSC and the timing of its imposition may vary. The CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of Class B shares that were
purchased more than a specified period (the ``CDSC Period'') prior to redemption or on Class B shares derived from
reinvestment of distributions. No CDSC will be imposed on an amount that represents an increase in the value of the
shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for shares purchased during the
CDSC Period; such a charge would be imposed, however, on the lesser of the net asset value of the shares redeemed (exclusive
of any reinvestment of dividends or distributions) at the time of redemption or the net asset value of such shares at
the time of purchase. In determining whether a CDSC is applicable, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first
of shares derived from reinvestment of distributions or amounts that represent an increase in the value of the shareholder's
account resulting from capital appreciation, second, of shares purchased prior to the CDSC Period, and third, of
shares purchased during the CDSC Period. In determining the rate of any applicable CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption
is made of Class B shares of a Fund held for the longest period of time within the CDSC Period. The CDSC schedule will comply,
to the extent applicable, with the requirements of section 26(d) of the Rules of Fair Practice of the NASD, as amended
from time to time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Applicants intend to waive or reduce the CDSC in certain circumstances. In waiving or reducing a CDSC, the Funds
will comply with rule 22d&hyph;1 under the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. If redeemed shares upon which a CDSC was imposed are reinvested in Class B shares of the same Fund or another Fund
within the period specified in the Fund's prospectus, Nuveen, as principal underwriter, will credit the shareholder's
account with the amount of the CDSC previously imposed. The Class B shares acquired through such reinvestment will
continue to be subject to the CDSC; the holding period of Class B shares thus acquired will include the holding period
of the redeemed Class B shares.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request an exemptive order to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of an unlimited number of
classes of shares representing interests in the Funds might be deemed to result in a ``senior security'' within the
meaning of section 18(g) of the Act and thus to be prohibited by section 18(f)(1), and violate the equal voting provisions
of section 18(i) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Section 18 is intended to prevent investment companies from issuing excessive amounts of senior securities and
thereby increasing unduly the speculative character of their junior securities, or from operating without adequate
assets or reserves. The proposed Multiple Class Plan does not involve borrowings, and does not affect the Funds' existing
assets or reserves. In addition, the proposed arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares
of the Funds, since each class of shares will participate in all of the Funds' appreciation or depreciation (if any),
income, and all of a Fund's expenses (with the exception of the Plan Payments and Class Expenses).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of Class Expenses in the manner described above, and the voting
rights relating to the Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans and Shareholder Service Plans are equitable and would not discriminate
unfairly against any group of shareholders. Because, with respect to any Fund, the rights and privileges of each class
of shares are substantially identical, the possibility that their interests would ever conflict would be remote.
In any event, the interests of the affected shareholders with respect to distribution and/or service fees would be
adequately protected since the distribution and service plans for each of those classes will conform to the requirements
of rule 12b&hyph;1 (except that a Shareholder Service Plan may not confer certain voting rights), including the requirement
that their implementation and continuance be approved on an annual basis by both the full board and the non-interested
directors of the respective Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants also request an exemption from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the
Act, and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to offer shares subject to a CDSC. Applicants
believe that implementation of the CDSC in the manner and under the circumstances described above would be fair and
in the best interests of shareholders of the Funds, and would be appropriate in the public interest, and consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

Applciants' Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that any order of the SEC granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund or a series, and be identical
in all respects except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of the same Fund or series
will relate solely to (a) certain Class Expenses, which shall be limited to (i) transfer agent fees attributable to
a specific class of shares; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such
as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) SEC
and state securities registration fees incurred by a specific class of shares; (iv) the expenses of administrative
personnel and services required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (v) litigation or other legal expenses
relating to a class of shares; (vi) directors' fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific
class of shares; and (vii) accounting expenses relating to a specific class of shares; (b) expenses payable by a class
pursuant to a Plan with respect to such class; (c) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to the
Funds' Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans and Shareholder Service Plans, except as provided in condition 15 below; (d) conversion
features; (e) exchange privileges; and (f) class designations. Any other incremental expenses not specifically
identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares
shall not be so allocated unless and until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The directors of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors, will have approved the Multiple
Class Plan prior to its implementation. The minutes of the meetings of the directors of the Funds regarding the deliberations
of the directors concerning, and their approval of, the Multiple Class Plan will reflect in detail the reasons for
their determination that the proposed Multiple Class Plan is in the best interests of both the Funds and their respective
shareholders.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and
otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the classes of
shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, will take such action as is reasonably
necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for
reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Adviser or the Distributor,
each at its own cost, will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment
company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Shareholder Service Plans will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b)
through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need
not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The directors will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing
expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the
statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will
be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or
servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any fee attributable to that class.
The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of
the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be paid in the same amount, except that Plan Payments and
any Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by that class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes
of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'').
The Expert has rendered a report to applicants, filed with this application as Exhibit C, that such methodology and
procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On
an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations
and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the applicants
that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the
periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert
with respect to such reports, following a request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to provide), will be available
for inspection by the SEC staff, upon the written request for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment
Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst,
an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial
report of the Expert is a ``report on the policies and procedures placed in operation,'' and the ongoing reports will
be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and
described in SAS No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), as it may be amended
from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses
among the classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred
to in condition 7 above, and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing
basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7 above. Applicants agree to take immediate
corrective action if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. The prospectus of each Fund will include a statement to the effect that any person entitled to receive compensation
for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to one particular class of shares
over another in the Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Any distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular investors.
Applicants will require all persons selling shares of a Fund to agree to conform to such standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors
of the Funds with respect to the Multiple Class Plan will be set forth in guidelines, which will be furnished to the directors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Each Fund will disclose the respective
expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports
will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the
Fund as a whole generally, and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per
class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement of sales literature
describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective
expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for
publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Fund's net asset value and public offering price will present
each class of shares separately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The initial determination of Class Expenses that will be applied to a class and any subsequent changes thereto
will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of directors, including a majority of the independent directors.
Any persons authorized to direct the application and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet Class Expenses
shall provide to the board of directors, and the directors shall review at least quarterly, a written report of the
amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Any class of shares with a conversion feature will convert into another class of shares on the basis of the relative
net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion,
the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior
to the conversion.

15. If a Fund implements any amendment to a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a Shareholder Service Plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by the shares
of a Target Class under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into the Target Class unless
the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The directors shall take such
action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of
shares (``New Target Class'') identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation
of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into the Target Class. If deemed
advisable by the directors to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase
Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material
respects except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target Class. New Target Class or New Purchase Class
may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected
in a manner that the directors reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition
3, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class or New Purchase Class
shall be borne solely by the adviser and the distributor. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the
proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features
of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective
registration statement.

16. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemption requested by the application will not imply SEC approval,
authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to Rule 12b-1
Plans or Shareholder Service Plans in reliance on the exemptive order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act Release No. 16619
(Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The CFIVAC was established by the Coast Guard as required by the Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act of 1988.
This notice announces that applications will be considered for six openings. The Coast Guard seeks applications
for three members in the category of fishing industry, one member in the category of general public, one member in the
category of education and training, and one member in the category of insurance underwriters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee consists of seventeen members as follows: Ten members from the fishing industry who reflect a regional
and representational balance and have experience in the operation of vessels to which chapter 45 of Title 46, United
States Code applies, or as a crew member or processing line worker on an uninspected fish processing vessel; one member
representing naval architects or marine surveyors; one member representing manufacturers of equipment for vessels
to which chapter 45 applies; one member representing education or training professional related to fishing vessel,
fish processing vessel, or fish tender vessel safety, or personnel qualifications; one member representing underwriters
that insure vessels to which chapter 45 applies, and three members representing the general public, including whenever
possible, an independent expert or consultant in maritime safety and a member of a national organization composed
of persons representing owners or vessels to which chapter 45 applies. The membership term is three years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A limited portion of the membership may serve consecutive terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those persons who submitted applications in reply to the May 3, 1993, notice need not reapply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To achieve the balance of membership required by the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Coast Guard is especially
interested in receiving applications from minorities and women. The members of the Committee serve without compensation
from the Federal Government, although travel reimbursement and per diem will be provided. The Committee normally
meets in Washington, DC, with working group meetings for specific problems on an as-required basis.

Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc.; Grant of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petition for Determination of Inconsequential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc. (Mercedes) of Montvale, New Jersey determined that the headlamps on some of
its vehicles fail to comply with the lens bonding requirements of 49 CFR 571.108, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No.
108, ``Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment,'' and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR
Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Mercedes also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and
remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (now 49 U.C.C. 30118 and 30120) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle
safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of receipt of the petition was published on February 11, 1994 and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR
6674). This notice grants the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section S4 of Standard No. 108 defines ``replaceable bulb headlamp'' as one that is comprised of a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bonded 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
lens and reflector assembly. From August 1991 to December 1993, the petitioner imported approximately 46,000 Mercedes-Benz
vehicles for sale in the United States in which the headlamps were not ``replaceable bulb headlamps'' because their
lenses were clipped onto their reflectors as an assembly rather than bonded. These vehicles included approximately
35,925 S-Class, 7,379 E-Class, and 2,632 C-Class models. In addition, approximately 1,873 noncompliant replacement
part headlamps and approximately 1,147 noncompliant replacement part headlamp lenses were sold to Mercedes-Benz
dealerships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mercedes supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Damaged Lenses Will Be Replaced With Complying Headlamp Assemblies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the number of replacement lenses sold in Model Years 1991&hyph;92, [Mercedes] estimates that approximately
500 lenses are replaced each year in the subject vehicles. Thus, the number of vehicles involved is relatively low.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective November 2, 1993, [Mercedes] no longer sells lenses as a replacement part. This means that no source for
replacement lenses now exists. Therefore, when lenses are damaged in the future, the owner's only recourse will be
to replace the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
entire 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
headlamp assembly that complies with Standard 108. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the unlikely event that a noncomplying aftermarket lens market were developed for the 46,000 vehicles produced,
their use would be restricted by state inspection laws. At the present time, approximately two-thirds of all states
have periodic inspection programs. As evidenced by *&blank;*&blank;* state vehicle regulations [which Mercedes
included with its petition and are contained in the Docket], replacement headlamp lenses are required to keep the
headlamp in compliance with Standard 108. It is our understanding that State Inspection garages routinely reject
cars if their headlamp lenses do not bear the ``DOT'' marking, since the lack of ``DOT'' quickly identifies the headlamp
as a non-U.S. unit. Therefore, in the unlikely event that a vehicle owner replaces a damaged lens with a noncomplying
aftermarket lens rather than a complying headlamp assembly, the vehicle will fail inspection in most states.

2. Headlamp Aim Not Affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a recently published 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (Docket 93&hyph;57) requesting comments on the subject of bonded versus unbonded headlamps, NHTSA stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In previous denials of petitions to allow removable headlamp lenses, NHTSA argued that mechanical aiming of lamps
with lens-mounted aiming pads could be affected by any change of the alignment relationship established between
lenses and reflectors at the time of manufacture. Thus, alteration of the original alignment during lens replacement
could misaim the beam. [58 Fed. Reg. 42,924 (August 12, 1993).]

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This concern is not relevant here because the vehicles in question contain 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
on-board aiming devices 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(vehicle headlamp aiming devices). No aiming pads are needed in such advanced technology. Since the lens does not
participate in the aiming of the headlamp, aiming cannot be affected by misalignment of the lens during lens replacement
in the Mercedes system.

 notice, NHTSA expressed concern that replacement lenses may alter the headlamp beam formation due to the fluting
(prescription) of the lens. Several factors assure photometric compliance with Standard 108 for the Mercedes-Benz
unbonded headlamp. First, in the headlamp manufacturing process, the headlamp is designed so that the lens can be
clipped onto any housing/reflector assembly and be assured of meeting the photometric performance requirements
of Standard 108. *&blank;*&blank;* [T]he design permits only a positive and secure attachment. There are no shims
or adjustments that could influence the lens mounting. Second, from a design point of view, the physical size of the
reflector and lens make the headlamp highly insensitive to minute positioning variations in mounting and/or manufacture.

4. Vehicle Maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All affected vehicles are within the time constraints of the warranty period. Thus, within the next 12 months, [Mercedes]
will be able to remedy the noncompliance when the subject vehicles are brought in for service. [Mercedes] will direct
dealers to bond the headlamps of all noncomplying vehicles brought to authorized dealers for service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In view of the fact that the headlamps comply with all performance aspects of Standard 108, that the replacement lenses
are no longer available from [Mercedes] or its dealers, and that the vehicles will be remedied shortly through routine
warranty maintenance, there is no adverse impact on safety. Therefore, [Mercedes believes that] NHTSA should grant
[its] petition for an exemption for an inconsequential noncompliance with Standard 108. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment was received, from Volkswagen of North America, Inc., which supported granting the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA's principal concerns with headlamp compliance are photometric performance and durability. The agency accepts
the petitioner's representation that the accuracy of headlamp aim is not affected by lens replacement. The fact that
the petitioner has undertaken to bond the lenses on vehicles that come in for warranty service addresses the agency's
concern on durability. NHTSA deems it unlikely that, during the warranty period which is early in the life of the headlamp,
the reflector assembly will deteriorate to a point that it affects photometric performance because the lens is clipped
rather than bonded. Although 100% of the noncompliant vehicles may not be returned for warranty work, it is the practice
of most vehicle owners to have such work done by a factory authorized dealer, and NHTSA deems it likely that most cars
will have the noncompliance corrected by the end of the 4-year warranty period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is currently considering a petition from Robert Bosch GmbH, the manufacturer of the noncompliant headlamps,
to permit the use of unbonded lenses on replaceable bulb headlamps that are equipped with on-vehicle aiming devices.
If NHTSA were to grant the petition and to propose such an amendment, it might be necessary to include enhanced durability
requirements that would help to ensure reflector integrity and resistance to contaminants between the time the lens
is damaged and the time it is replaced. At this point, the agency does not know how the unbonded Mercedes headlamps would
perform under such enhanced requirements that are yet to be fully developed and evaluated. Therefore, the bonding
by Mercedes of its vehicle headlamps seems to be a prudent course of action under the circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition also covered replacement headlamps and replacement lenses. NHTSA understands that these parts are
intended to replace parts on the headlamps covered by the petition, and deems it likely that most of the vehicles equipped
with the replacement headlamps or lenses will be inspected and corrected during the warranty period as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby found that Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., has met its burden
of persuasion that the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety and
its petition is granted.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under 49 U.S.C. &sect;30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has determined that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. &sect;30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year
as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the

Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;90&hyph;009) has petitioned
NHTSA to determine whether 1994 Mercedes-Benz S280 (Model ID 140.028) passenger cars are eligible for importation
into the United States. The vehicle which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1994 Mercedes-Benz
S320. Champagne has submitted information indicating that Daimler Benz A.G., the company that manufactured the
1994 Mercedes-Benz S320, certified that vehicle as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
and offered it for sale in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner contends that it carefully compared the S280 to the S320, and found the two models to be substantially
similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the 1994 model S280, as originally
manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as the 1994 model S320 that
was offered for sale in the United States, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the 1994 model S280 is identical to the certified 1994 model S320 with respect
to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

Form 1120&hyph;FSC is filed by foreign corporations that have elected to be foreign sales corporations (FSCs) or
small FSCs. The FSC uses Form 1120&hyph;FSC to report income and expenses and to figure its tax liability. IRS uses

and expenses and figured its tax liability correctly.

TDA is undertaking a broad project evaluation program. Surveys and information collection activities will be carried
out in order to assess how to continuously improve the agency's effectiveness and responsiveness to its customers.
TDA seeks information on whether its programs have benefited the U.S. private sector and the host countries in which
they are implemented. The results of the evaluation program should assist TDA in planning future activities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is hereby given that special use permit fees for commercial uses on National Wildlife Refuges (refuges) in
Alaska have been revised. The revised fee schedule became effective on January 1, 1993. Fees equal to 50% of the fee
schedule were charged during 1993, and full fees are being charged in 1994. The public was aware of this fee change through
public meetings and other appropriate notice. However, as a policy matter, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service)
desires to publish this Notice through the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised fee schedule has been incorporated into the Service Policy Manual for Region 7 (Alaska). The fee revision
was needed so that the Service could meet Federal mandates. These mandates require fee determinations to be based
on fair market values, and that the Service attempt to recover costs of administering revenue producing commercial
activities on refuge lands.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service is implementing the following fee schedule for commercial guides, outfitters, and transporters that
are issued special use permits to conduct commercial operations on refuges in Alaska. Fees for other non-recreational
types of commercial activities that involve removing marketable resources or utilizing reserved sites will not
be based on the following fee schedule. Fees for these types of commercial activities will be determined by the Service's
Division of Realty and will be based on fair market analysis surveys. These surveys will be conducted periodically
to assure that fees reflect current market values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service considered a number of methods for meeting the required mandates. Four alternatives were given serious
consideration and were published in the May 31, 1991, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 24827) to receive public comment. These alternatives were: (1) A single fixed fee of $350 for all commercial
permittees, (2) a fee schedule based on type of commercial use activity and actual client numbers, (3) a fee schedule
based on permittee calculations, made after the permit use period, of 3% of adjusted gross income derived from commercial
activities that are authorized by special use permit on refuge lands, and (4) a fee schedule based on permittee estimates,
made prior to the permit use period, of 3% of anticipated adjusted gross income derived from commercial activities
that are authorized by special use permit on refuge lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service had proposed to adopt alternative 4 because it appeared that it would be (1) equitable to all commercial
use permittees, regardless of the scale of their operation; (2) charging a fair market value; (3) reasonably consistent
with the fee schedule of other Federal agencies in Alaska; and (4) cost effective for the government to administer.
Thirty-five comments were received from individuals, professional organizations, and state and Federal agencies
in response to the published 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. After review and consideration of the comments received, the Service decided not to implement this alternative.
Public comments identified several potential inequities in the originally proposed alternative and strongly supported
a flat fee or a client use-day system. A flat fee was reconsidered but was not selected because the Service believes
it is not equitable to all commercial operators since the scale of operations is highly variable among users. As a result
of public comment, the Service is implementing the following fee system which is based on the type of activity and number
of client use-days. The specific fee for each type of client use-day is based on an adjusted three percent of gross receipts
figure which returns approximately 1.5&hyph;2.0 percent of the typical daily rate charged to clients by commercial
guides, outfitters, and transporters in Alaska. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service's fee schedule system requires a non-refundable $100.00 administrative fee charged at the issuance
of a permit and a predetermined fee for client use-days, based on the activity, charged following each session of use.
Client use-day fees for all guiding, outfitting, and transporting commercial operations on Alaska refuges are:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service will review and issue an adjustment to these fees every three years. Adjustments will be based on the Implicit
Price Deflator Index (IPDI) which is compiled annually by the Department of Commerce and is published in February
of each year as part of the ``Economic Report of the President'' for Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permittees will be required to obtain a special use permit from each refuge that they operate on and full fees will be
collected by each refuge. Client use-day fees will be based on actual client use days and be in addition to the $100 administrative
fee. A ``client use-day'' shall be defined as one calendar day, or any portion thereof, for each client using the refuge.
If clients are concurrently participating in more than one activity during the same calendar day, the highest client
use-day rate will be used for that day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permittee is responsible for record keeping and reporting the actual number of client use-days to the refuge manager
and shall be required to report actual use within 30 days of the end of the authorized use period, unless otherwise stated
in the permit. The refuge manager is responsible for computing the actual fees owed the government and issuing a bill
for collection within 30 days of receipt of the use report. Permittees are responsible to pay the fees within 30 days
of receipt of the bill for collection. A permittee will not be issued a new special use permit until all fees have been
paid. Special use permits issued for several year terms may be revoked during the term of the permit if annual fees are
not paid within the required 30 day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fees for reserved land sites (e.g., cabins, tent platforms, caches, etc.) associated with commercial operations
remained at the $100 flat fee during 1993. The Division of Realty conducted a fair market value analysis survey for
reserved land sites on a refuge-by-refuge basis during 1993. Revised reserved land site fees will become effective
in late 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 9, 1994, the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) and the FAA issued two related notices on the subject
of Federal policy on airport rates and charges. A notice of proposed policy entitled ``Proposed Policy Regarding
Airport Rates and Charges,'' listed and explained the principles that the OST and the FAA believe define Federal policy
on the rates and fees that an airport can charge to aeronautical users of the airport. Notice 94&hyph;18, a notice of
proposed rulemaking entitled ``Rules of Practice for Federally Assisted Airports,'' proposed detailed procedures
for the filing, investigation, and adjudication of complaints against airports for alleged violation of Federal
requirements involving rates and charges and other airport-related requirements (59 FR 29880, June 9, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letters filed in both dockets, ACI&hyph;NA, AAAE, and ATA request an extension of the comment period for both notices.
The commenters request an extension because they believe that additional time is needed to coordinate with members
of each organization and formulate a position, and because legislation now under consideration by Congress could
require DOT/FAA to make changes in one or both notices. The commenters request an extension of 4 weeks from the date
a conference report is issued on the pending legislation or from the date of enactment of new legislation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide persons interested in the notice the opportunity to consider their positions in light of congressional
action, and to provide additional time to prepare comments, the OST and the FAA find that it would be in the public interest
to extend the comment period for a reasonable time. Accordingly, the comment period for the notice of proposed policy
and the notice of proposed rulemaking are both extended from August 8 to September 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that legislation is enacted that requires that a final policy statement and final rule be issued by a certain
date, the OST and the FAA may issue a subsequent notice shortening the comment period if necessary to meet the statutory
deadline for a final rule. Notice of any further change in the comment period would be published in the
