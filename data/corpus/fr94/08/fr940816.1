<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Each year, there are two open seasons during which participants may elect to commence contributions to the TSP, change
the amount of their contributions or the allocation of their contributions among the TSP investment funds, or terminate
contributions without forfeiting the ability to resume contributing during the next open season. The regulatory
notice requirement for open seasons was established by the Board in 1987 shortly after the Thrift Savings Plan came
into existence. At that time, it was not clear whether open seasons would occur at the same time and for the same duration
each year. However, since then, there have been two open seasons each year: May 15&hyph;July 31 and November 15&hyph;January
31. The last month of each open season has been designated the ``election period'', which is defined in 5 CFR &sect;1600.1.
Since the open seasons have not varied since 1988, the Board is now amending its regulations to establish a permanent
schedule for the beginning and ending dates and to eliminate the requirement that an advance notice of each open season
be published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act (the FRA) (12 U.S.C. 375a) prohibits member banks from making extensions
of credit to their executive officers except to the extent authorized by that section. Section 22(h) of the FRA (12
U.S.C. 375b) prohibits member banks from making extensions of credit to their executive officers, directors, principal
shareholders, or to a related interest (any company or political or campaign committee that is controlled by an executive
officer, director, or principal shareholder), except to the extent authorized by that section. Section 18(j)(2)
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDI Act) (12 U.S.C. 1828(j)(2)) provides that both sections 22(g) and 22(h)
of the FRA are applicable to insured nonmember banks in the same manner and to the same extent as though they were member
banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC regulation which implements sections 22(g) and 22(h) for insured nonmember banks is 12 CFR 337.3. Section
337.3(a) currently provides that insured nonmember banks are subject to the restrictions contained in Subpart A
of 12 CFR Part 215, Regulation O (Regulation O), the regulations promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the FRS) to implement sections 22(g) and 22(h) for member banks, to the same extent and to the same manner
as though they were member banks, with the exception of &sect;&sect;215.5(b), 215.5(c)(3) and 215.11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 22(g)(2) of the FRA provides that a loan secured by a first lien on a residence of an executive officer may be
made in any amount. Section 22(g)(3) of the FRA provides that loans to finance the educations of executive officers'
children may be made in any amount. These requirements are implemented respectively by 12 CFR 215.5(c) (1) and (2).
Such loans do, however, count toward the general individual and aggregate lending limits applicable to executive
officers, directors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principal shareholders, and their related interests under 12 CFR 215.4 of Regulation O. See 12 CFR 215.5(d)(2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 22(g)(4) of the FRA provides that extensions of credit to an executive officer not otherwise specifically
authorized by section 22(g) may be made ``in an amount prescribed in a regulation of the member bank's appropriate
Federal banking agency''. Pursuant to its authority under section 22(g)(4), the Board of Directors of the FDIC has
set the lending limit on extensions of credit by insured nonmember banks to executive officers for any other purpose
not specified in &sect;215.5(c)(1) and (2) of Regulation O at the higher of 2.5 percent of the bank's capital and unimpaired
surplus but in no event more than $100,000. See 12 CFR 337.3(c)(2). The Board of Directors of the FDIC now proposes to
except loans which are fully collateralized by certain categories of highly stable and liquid collateral from being
counted toward the ``other purpose'' general lending limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board of Directors of the FDIC proposes to create an exception to the lending limit for other purpose loans to executive
officers for those loans which are fully secured by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A perfected security interest in bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, or Treasury bills of the United
States or in other such obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Unconditional takeout commitments or guarantees of any department, agency, bureau, board, commission or establishment
of the United States or any corporation wholly owned directly or indirectly by the United States; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A perfected security interest in a segregated deposit account in the lending bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the proposed exception is adopted, a loan to an executive officer of an insured nonmember bank which has been secured
by any of the types of collateral listed above may be made in any amount and will not be subject to the limit for other purpose
loans set forth in 12 CFR 337.3(c)(2). This exception will be in addition to the statutory exceptions to the other purpose
lending limit for home mortgage loans and education loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the opinion of the Board of Directors of the FDIC that the creation of such an exception to the general lending limit
on loans to executive officers of insured nonmember banks is consistent with safe and sound banking practices. This
is because the Board of Directors believes that extensions of credit which have been collateralized in the manner
described above pose a minimal risk of loss to a bank. The Board of Directors of the FDIC is also of the opinion that the
proposed exception would not lend itself to abuse because the collateralized loans to executive directors would
still continue to be subject to the requirement that the loan not be on more favorable terms than those afforded other
borrowers (section 22(g)(1) of the FRA) and would still be subject to the prohibitions against preferential lending
in section 22(h) of the FRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes parallel changes recently made by the Board of Governors of the FRS to its regulations. See 59
FR 8831 (1994).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board of Directors is proposing to adopt the same exception to the limit for other purpose loans to executive officers
that the Board of Governors of the FRS promulgated for member banks in order to put insured state nonmember banks on
an equal footing with state member banks, thus avoiding disparity of treatment among banks based upon their membership,
or lack of membership, in the Federal Reserve System.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Along with the new exception to the general lending limit on loans to executive officers, the Board of Governors of
the FRS made a number of other substantive, technical and conforming changes to 12 CFR Part 215, Regulation O. These
changes were effective on February 18, 1994. See 59 FR at 8831. These changes became applicable to insured nonmember
banks on February 18, 1994, without any need for action on the part of the FDIC because insured nonmember banks are subject
to the regulations of the FRS which implement section 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA, with the exception of the provisions
which implement section 22(g)(4). For a comprehensive discussion of these changes, see 59 FR at 8831&hyph;8837.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted before, it is the responsibility of each federal banking agency under section 22(g)(4) to specify the limit
on other purpose loans to executive officers of the depository institutions which are subject to a particular banking
agency's supervision. The FDIC specifies the limit on other purpose loans to executive officers of insured nonmember
banks in 12 CFR 337.3(c)(2). Prior to the most recent amendments to Regulation O, &sect;215.5(c)(3) specified the
limit on other purpose loans to executive officers by member banks. 12 CFR 215.5(c)(3) was amended by the Board of Governors
of the FRS to provide that a loan may be made by a member bank to one of its executive officers in any amount if it has been
secured by certain types of collateral. The Board of Governors of the FRS concurrently redesignated the provision
which sets forth the limit for other purpose loans by member banks to their executive officers as 12 CFR 215.5(c)(4).
59 FR at 8840&hyph;8841. In light of these regulatory changes by the FRS, the Board of Directors of the FDIC proposes
to amend &sect;337.3 to cross-reference &sect;215.5(c)(4), along with &sect;215.5(c)(3), as one of the provisions
of Regulation O which are inapplicable to insured nonmember banks.

III. Requests for Comment

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board of Directors specifically requests comment from all interested parties as to whether it is appropriate
for the FDIC to establish an exception to the limit on other purpose loans to executive officers of insured nonmember
banks for loans that have been collateralized in the manner described above.

which the FDIC proposes are the most appropriate means to create an exception to the limit on other purpose loans to
executive officers of insured nonmember banks. If a commenter should feel that there is a better alternative to the
proposed amendments, the Board of Directors of the FDIC requests that the alternative be specifically described.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the FDIC hereby certifies that the
proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If adopted, the
rule will not impose burdens on depository institutions of any size and will not have the type of economic impact addressed
by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC has reached this conclusion because the effect of the rule, if it is ultimately promulgated in its current
form, will be to reduce the regulatory requirements that are imposed upon small depository institutions rather than
to increase them. Small depository institutions will have greater freedom of action to extend credit to executive
officers as a result of the proposed rule rather than less.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations by adding a new provision that would allow for test programs
and procedures in general and, specifically, for purposes of implementing those Customs Modernization provisions
of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act that provide for the National Customs Automation Program.
The proposed regulation would allow the Commissioner of Customs to conduct limited test programs/ procedures, which
have as their goal the more efficient and effective processing of passengers, carriers, and merchandise, and impose
upon participants requirements different from those specified in the Customs Regulations, but only to the extent
that such different requirements do not affect the collection of the revenue, public health, safety, or law enforcement.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the Act), Public Law 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat.
2057 (December 8, 1993), contains provisions pertaining to Customs Modernization (107 Stat. 2170). Subtitle B of
title VI establishes the National Customs Automation Program (NCAP)_an automated and electronic system for the
processing of commercial importations. Section 631 in Subtitle B of the Act creates sections 411 through 414 of the
Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1411&hyph;1414), which define and list the existing and planned components of the NCAP
(section 411), promulgate program goals (section 412), provide for the implementation and evaluation of the program
(section 413), and provide for remote location filing (section 414).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 631 of the Act provides Customs with direct statutory authority for full electronic processing of all Customs-related
transactions. For each planned NCAP program component, Customs is required to prepare a separate implementation
plan in consultation with the trade community, establish eligibility criteria for voluntary participation in the
program, test the component, and transmit to Congress the implementation plan, testing results, and an evaluation
report. The testing of any planned NCAP components would be conducted under carefully delineated circumstances_with
objective measures of success or failure, a predetermined time frame, and a defined class of participants. Notice
of any NCAP program component testing would be published in both the Customs Bulletin and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and participants solicited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to testing planned NCAP components there are other areas of Customs-related transactions wherein Customs
and the trade community could benefit from the valuable information that limited test programs/procedures could
provide. Thus, Customs is proposing this regulation in order both to meet its obligations under the NCAP legislation
and to provide itself with the ability to obtain information necessary to predict the effects of various policy options.
If adopted, the regulation would allow the Commissioner of Customs to conduct limited test programs and procedures
and allow certain eligible members of the public to participate on a voluntary basis. Also, because test programs
could require exemptions from regulations in various parts of the Customs Regulations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 parts 113 (Customs bonds), 141 (entry of merchandise), 142 (entry process), 171 (fines, penalties, and forfeitures),
174 (protests), and 191 (drawback), participants would be subject to requirements different from those specified
in the Customs Regulations, but only to the extent that such different requirements do not affect the collection of
the revenue, public health, safety, or law enforcement. Accordingly, pursuant to the Secretary's authority under
section 624 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1624) to make such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry
out the provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930 and pursuant to the requirement set forth in section 413 of the Tariff Act
of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1413) that the Secretary test planned NCAP program components, it is proposed to amend the Customs
Regulations at part 101 (19 CFR part 101) to allow the Commissioner of Customs to conduct limited test programs and
procedures in general, as well as for purposes of implementing the NCAP provisions of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Proposed Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs proposes to amend part 101 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 101) by adding a new &sect;101.9, which would
allow the Commissioner of Customs to conduct limited test programs and procedures in general and for purposes of implementing
NCAP program components, which may impose upon eligible participants requirements different from those specified
in the Customs Regulations, but only to the extent that such different requirements do not affect the collection of
the revenue, public health, safety, or law enforcement. Those test programs/procedures related to the NCAP would
be subject to certain time, scope, participation, and publication constraints, whereas, those test programs that
are not related to the NCAP would be subject, in general, to constraints concerning time and scope only. However, because
general test programs may affect the processing not only of passengers and carriers but also the importation of merchandise,
Customs recognizes that the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1484(a)(2)(C), as amended, require that, to the maximum extent
practicable, the Secretary provide for the equal treatment of all importers of record of imported merchandise. Accordingly,
the proposed regulation requires that notice be published in both the Customs Bulletin and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 before implementing those limited tests or procedures that involve merchandise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to implement test programs and procedures in general (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tests that are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of new technology or operational procedures in the processing
of passengers, carriers, or merchandise) paragraph (a) authorizes the Commissioner of Customs to provide for requirements
different from those specified in the Customs Regulations, but only to the extent that such different requirements
do not affect the collection of the revenue, public health, safety, or law enforcement. Such different requirements
will be limited in scope, time, and application as necessary to facilitate the conduct of the specified program or
procedure. Where the test program or procedure could affect the processing of merchandise, however, not less than
thirty days prior to implementing such test program or procedure a notice of the test program would be published in
both the Customs Bulletin and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, inviting public comments concerning the methodology of the test program or procedure, and which informs interested
members of the public of the eligibility criteria for voluntary participation in the test program and the basis for
selecting participants. Where the test program or procedure does not affect the importation of merchandise and is
not required under the NCAP legislation, however, public notice would not be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to implement test programs and procedures for purposes of implementing NCAP program components, as described
in section 411(a)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1411(a)(2)), paragraph (b) similarly authorizes the Commissioner
of Customs to provide for requirements that may be different from those specified in the Customs Regulations, but
only to the extent that such different requirements do not affect the collection of the revenue, public health, safety,
or law enforcement. The publication requirement on tests of planned NCAP components is similar. Not less than 30 days
prior to implementing any test program or procedure notice of the NCAP test would be published in both the Customs Bulletin
and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that invites public comments concerning the test program, and informs interested members of the public of the eligibility
criteria for voluntary participation in the test program and the basis for selecting participants. Within a reasonable
time following the completion of the test program or procedure a description of the results would be published in both
the Customs Bulletin and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

submitted to Customs. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom
of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), &sect;1.4 of the Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the regulation proposed seeks to alleviate regulatory burdens rather than impose new ones, it does not constitute

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document withdraws the proposed amendment to the Customs Regulations, which would have eliminated the requirement
that the notice of exportation, Customs Form 7511, be submitted as proof of exportation for the purpose of obtaining
drawback, and instead permitted the use of other documents generated internally in the course of trade to prove exportation.
Customs has concluded that the retention of the notice of exportation is essential, especially in those circumstances
where the drawback claimant is not the direct exporter, and the exporter refuses to provide its own documentary evidence
to the claimant because of business confidentiality or the administrative cost of providing such supporting documents.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Drawback is a refund or remission, in whole or in part, of a Customs duty, internal revenue tax or fee. There are a number
of different kinds of drawback authorized under law, including, for example, manufacturing drawback and unused
merchandise drawback. In order to qualify for drawback, there must be an exportation or a destruction under Customs
supervision. The statute providing for specific types of drawback is 19 U.S.C. 1313. Part 191, Customs Regulations
(19 CFR part 191), contains the general regulations for drawback claims and specialized provisions for specific
types of drawback claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements for establishing the exportation of merchandise as part of a drawback claim are set forth in subpart
E of part 191. This subpart authorizes the use of several alternative procedures to establish exportation. Two such
alternatives, contained in &sect;&sect;191.51(a) and 191.52 (19 CFR 191.51(a), 191.52), require a claimant, in
order to receive drawback, to file a notice of exportation on Customs Form (CF) 7511, either uncertified, or certified
by a Customs officer at the time of exportation, for each shipment of merchandise exported. The information required
on a CF 7511 consists of the name of the exporting vessel or carrier, the number and kinds of packages and their marks
and numbers, a description of the merchandise, the name of the exporter, and the country of ultimate destination.
This information, however, is also available from other paperwork, particularly documents usually generated by
the exporter internally in the process of trade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, Customs published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 7, 1992 (57 FR 46113), which would have eliminated the notice of exportation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CF 7511, and instead permitted the use of such other documents generated internally in the course of trade to prove
exportation for purposes of obtaining drawback. It was believed that this would result in a saving of paperwork to
the benefit of both Customs as well as the drawback claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thirty comments were received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking. Of the thirty comments only four generally
were in favor of eliminating or replacing the CF 7511. The remaining twenty-six comments strongly opposed the elimination
of the CF 7511. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Almost all of the commenters opposing the elimination of the CF 7511 stated that they would be forced to relinquish
their right to claim drawback whenever they were not the direct exporter. A separate exporter might not be willing
to provide documentation that would reveal information such as the name and address of the foreign purchaser and prices
charged by the exporter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, many of these commenters believed that the CF 7511 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was necessary for shipments to Mexico and Canada, citing the unavailability of other documents as a continuing problem
for drawback claimants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another reason against the proposed change mentioned by several commenters was the fact that the reverse side of the
CF 7511 is used for the endorsement of drawback rights from one party to another. This endorsement also satisfies the
requirement of &sect;191.73(a), which requires satisfactory evidence that the reservation was made with the knowledge
and consent of the exporter. If this form were to be abolished, Customs would probably have to develop another form
to take its place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was further asserted that the CF 7511 in fact also provided information that might not be readily available on other
documents, such as the name of the carrier, the date of exportation, the destination, and the shipper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Though the concerns about proof of exportation to Mexico and Canada have been resolved by &sect;181.47(c), Customs
Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(19 CFR 181.47(c)), which also allows a copy of the Canadian or Mexican customs entry to be used as proof of exportation,
Customs is, nevertheless, constrained to conclude that the comments submitted point out persuasive, and controlling,
reasons militating against adoption of the proposal, and that, on balance, the retention of the notice of exportation
satisfies the concerns of the trade, while occasioning relatively minimum and reasonably justified time and effort
in its preparation and/or certification. In particular, the retention of the notice is essential, especially in
those circumstances where the drawback claimant is not the direct exporter, and the exporter refuses to provide its
own documentary evidence to the claimant because of business confidentiality or the administrative cost of providing
such supporting documents.

Withdrawal of Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In view of the foregoing, and after consideration of the comments received and further review of the matter, Customs
has determined to withdraw the notice of proposed rulemaking published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is committed to initiatives that will provide access to capital
and economic empowerment for all Americans. HUD has launched several programs to stem disinvestment in cities and
disadvantaged communities throughout the country, increase the flow of capital into these communities, and create
communities of opportunity throughout the nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among HUD's priorities are: (1) Empowerment of local communities by supporting local economic development efforts;
(2) expansion of housing opportunities through partnerships with state and local government and private developers
and financial institutions; and (3) opening housing markets through vigorous enforcement of the Fair Housing Act
(42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;3619). A critical component of these initiatives is assuring access to capital for homeownership
and business development. Assuring fair access to property or hazard insurance is essential to achieve each of these
objectives. Insurance is necessary for access to capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Act, including the promulgation of regulations under
the Act. HUD is also responsible for receiving and investigating complaints alleging discriminatory practices
under the Act and bringing enforcement actions where the Department determines that reasonable cause exists to believe
that a violation has occurred or is about to occur. As part of these initiatives, and in furtherance of its responsibilities
under the Act, HUD announces its intent to issue regulations concerning property insurance practices that are discriminatory
under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in HUD's current regulations, discriminatory housing practices include ``refusing to provide *&blank;*&blank;*
property or hazard insurance *&blank;*&blank;* or providing such *&blank;*&blank;* insurance differently because
of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.'' 24 CFR 100.70(d)(4). Case precedents

II. Solicitation of Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD is requesting public comment in several areas to be addressed by the regulation. There are several complex issues
to be addressed by this regulation. In developing this regulation, HUD will work closely with insurance companies,
trade associations, State regulators, civil rights groups and community organizations to ensure that HUD has heard
as many viewpoints as possible on the subject of property insurance practices. HUD already has begun informal discussions
with representatives of these entities, organizations and individuals to learn more about their views on current
property insurance practices and about issues that HUD should address in the regulation. These contacts will continue
in the form of group meetings and informal discussions with insurance companies, advocacy groups and trade associations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, HUD will hold several public meetings around the country for industry groups, advocacy groups and private
citizens to submit comments and discuss what the regulation should address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments that HUD receives in response to this notice and comments presented at the public meetings, as
well as any written guidance received from additional communications with industry groups and others, HUD will publish
a proposed rule. Following careful consideration of the comments received on the proposed rule, HUD will issue a final
regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD is considering the issues and areas that the regulation should address in order for the regulation: (1) to be effective
as guidance to HUD investigators, state and local civil rights agencies and private fair housing groups; (2) to serve
as a guidepost for preventive acts by the industry; and (3) to be a clear description of the rights afforded protected
classes. To do so, the regulation will address specific practices that are prohibited under the Act, describe the
standards to be utilized in determining whether violations of the Act have occurred, and discuss investigative techniques
that will be utilized, remedies that will be sought where violations are found, and voluntary affirmative efforts
that are appropriate to eliminate discrimination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standards for determining discrimination in this area are those utilized in all other areas covered by the Act.
Specific practices that violate the Act will be identified and the factual circumstances for identifying violations
will be defined. The rule will describe the investigative techniques HUD will utilize, including those HUD employs
in current fair housing complaint investigations. The rule will identify remedies to be considered that are appropriate
to insurance cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The areas for which HUD specifically requests comment from the public are the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Underwriting practices that may discriminate due to either disparate treatment or disparate impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Sales and marketing practices that may discriminate due to either disparate treatment or disparate impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Explanations or justifications for those industry practices that could be challenged as violations of the Act
because of disparate treatment or disparate impact. In cases of disparate impact, explanations should address the
business necessity for the practice and why no less discriminatory alternative exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Barriers to the availability of insurance, or barriers to equal terms and conditions of insurance, for particular
protected classes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Entities and individuals who should be covered by the prohibition against discriminatory insurance practices,
such as mutual and stock companies, independent agents, direct writers, exclusive agents, and rating services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Techniques HUD should use in complaint investigations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Remedies HUD should consider to discourage discriminatory practices, including equitable, injunctive, and
affirmative relief, monetary damages, and civil penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Voluntary actions insurers can take to assure nondiscrimination and to increase availability of insurance to
allow access to capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Other issues that are relevant to the issue of insurance discrimination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under existing regulations, fees for booking transits at the Panama Canal are assessed at a fixed rate per Panama Canal
Gross Ton. The Panama Canal Commission has proposed a major revision of the rules for measurement of vessels using
the Panama Canal expected to become effective October 1, 1994. Under the proposal, the existing rules of measurement
will be replaced with the Panama Canal Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS). PC/UMS will no longer utilize a Panama
Canal Gross Tonnage value. Accordingly, fees for the use of the transit booking or reservation system must be assessed
on some other basis. This proposed rule recommends retention of the existing method of calculating booking fees for
vessels subject to PC/UMS transitional relief measures and the fixing of fees for all other vessels in reference to
the PC/UMS Net Ton.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 18, 1994, the Panama Canal Commission published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 18332) an advance notice of proposed rulemaking with a request for comments and a notice of hearing with respect
to a related matter_a complete revision of the Rules for Measurement of Vessels for the Panama Canal as set forth in
35 CFR part 135. Comments were solicited and received, and a public hearing was held May 25, 1994 in Washington, DC.
The views presented by the interested parties were considered by the Board of Directors of the Panama Canal Commission.
The Board gave final approval on July 13, 1994 to proceed with implementation of the PC/UMS. The proposed rule together
with the Board's recommendation was forwarded to the President for his approval. The proposed rule was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36398). It is expected that, on or before August 30, the final rule will be approved by the President
and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. It is scheduled to become effective October 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Corresponding changes in the transit booking system regulations are necessary to reconcile 35 CFR &sect;103.8(e)
with the aforementioned revisions to the rules for measurement of vessels using the Panama Canal. Under existing
&sect;103.8(e), fees for booking transits at Panama Canal are assessed at $0.23 per Panama Canal Gross Ton. With the
expected replacement of the existing regulations on October 1, 1994, a Panama Canal Gross Ton value will no longer
exist. Instead, under the revisions, the new PC/UMS will utilize a PC/UMS Net Ton value. Accordingly, in order to continue
using tonnage as the basis for rate assessment for the transit booking system, fees must be assessed on the tonnage
value used in the PC/UMS. Therefore, the Commission proposes that for vessels transiting the Canal for the first time
after September 30, 1994 transit booking fees be fixed in relation to the PC/UMS Net Ton. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, however, the Commission desires to minimize the financial impact of the change on the customer. As
with the PC/UMS itself, the Commission is striving for revenue-neutrality in the aggregate and for minimal impact
for the individual customer. Therefore, the proposed rule also provides special relief measures for vessels which
have previously transited the Canal.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the first category_vessels which have not transited the Canal before October 1, 1994, the proposed regulation
establishes a proposed new rate of $0.26 per PC/UMS Net Ton. This rate of $0.26 per PC/UMS Net Ton is expected to result
in a booking fee near the rate assessed under the existing system. In other words, the amount paid by an individual vessel
at $0.26 per PC/UMS Net Ton will closely approximate the amount it would have paid at $0.23 per Panama Canal Gross Ton.
The new booking fee rate system will be applied to a limited number of vessels inasmuch as the number of first-time transits
involves a relatively small number of vessels each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the Commission's intention is to revise the rate in a manner which maintains fees at approximately
the same level as currently paid by individual vessels. Retention of the $0.23 rate_merely fixing fees at $0.23 per
PC/UMS Net Ton_could reduce individual booking fees as much as 20%. Inasmuch as the intent of this proposal is solely
to reconcile paragraph 103.8(e) with the new standard tonnage measurement and not to otherwise alter the booking
fees, the agency proposes the $0.26 rate which approximates present booking fees without increasing customer costs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the other and larger category_vessels which have previously transited the Canal, the proposal retains the existing
booking fee computation method. This recommendation has its genesis in the proposed revisions to the Rules for Measurement
of Vessels using the Panama Canal. The PC/UMS proposed rule contains transitional relief measures which preserve
existing tonnage for ships transiting the Canal between March 23, 1976 (the date of the last significant rules change)
and September 30, 1994, inclusive. In the instant proposed rule, the Commission proposes that the method for assessing
booking fees for these vessels be similarly retained. Vessels meeting the aforementioned PC/UMS requirements for
transitional relief which use the booking system after September 30, 1994 will not be affected inasmuch as they will
continue to pay the same fee_$0.23 per Panama Canal Gross Ton. For these previously-transiting vessels, the booking
fee would change only in the event the vessel undergoes a significant structural change, defined in the PC/UMS as a
change in the volume of the vessel of 10% or more. Under the PC/UMS, a vessel undergoing a significant structural change
loses its entitlement to the relief measures and becomes subject to application of the PC/UMS measurement formulas.
In such an instance, the new rate of $0.26 per PC/UMS Net Ton would be applied to the vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has been exempted from Executive Order 12866 and, accordingly, the provisions of that directive do
not apply to this proposed rule. Even if the order were applicable, the proposed regulation, which concerns ``rates''
and ``practices relating'' thereto, would not constitute a ``rule'' as that term is defined in the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601(2)) and would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under that Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the environmental effect of the proposed measurement rule changes concludes that the proposed change
will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. An environmental impact statement is not
required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Administrator of the Panama Canal Commission certifies that these proposed regulations meet the applicable
standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order No. 12778.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This addendum to the General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 principally
describes EPA's preliminary views on how the Agency should interpret various provisions of title I with regard to
requirements for PM&hyph;10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers)
serious nonattainment area State implementation plans (SIP's). This document also addresses policy and guidance
on attainment date waivers potentially applicable to all areas that have been designated nonattainment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PM&hyph;10, waivers of certain requirements applicable to PM&hyph;10 serious nonattainment areas, and requirements
for international border areas in PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. Although the guidance includes various statements
that States must take certain actions, these statements are made pursuant to EPA's preliminary interpretations,
and thus do not bind States and the public as a matter of law. This addendum is an advance notice of how EPA generally intends
to take action on SIP submissions and to interpret various PM&hyph;10 related title I provisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 1 CFR 5.9(c), this document is published in the proposed rules category.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Issues are discussed in this document regarding policy and guidance that will be applicable to areas that have been
designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and reclassified as serious areas. This document also discusses issues
regarding policy and guidance on attainment date waivers potentially applicable to all areas that have been designated
nonattainment for PM&hyph;10, as well as policy and guidance on waivers of certain other requirements applicable
to PM&hyph;10 serious nonattainment areas, and requirements for international border areas in PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initially, all areas designated as nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 are classified as moderate areas (see section 188(a)
of the Clean Air Act (Act)).
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Subsequently, in accordance with section 188(b) of the Act, ``The Administrator may reclassify as a serious PM&hyph;10
nonattainment area *&blank;*&blank;* any area that the Administrator determines cannot practicably attain the
national ambient air quality standard for PM&hyph;10 by the attainment date (as prescribed in subsection (c)) for
moderate areas'' or any area that fails to timely attain. The EPA took final action on January 8, 1993 to reclassify
5 moderate areas that were initially designated as nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 upon enactment of the 1990 Amendments
(see 58 FR 3334). The EPA is considering reclassifying additional areas from moderate to serious.

The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the air quality planning requirements for areas
that do not meet (or that significantly contribute to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the PM&hyph;10
national ambient air quality standards (see Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399). References herein are to the

This guidance document is being published as an addendum to the General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (General Preamble) published April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13498).
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Among other things, this PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area guidance document describes EPA's preliminary views on
how EPA should interpret various provisions of title I with regard to requirements for PM&hyph;10 serious area SIP's.
Although the guidance includes various statements that States must take certain actions, these statements are made
pursuant to EPA's preliminary interpretations, and thus do not bind the States and the public as a matter of law. Of
course, the use of prescriptive language is appropriate in those instances where the policy is simply reiterating
statutory mandates which provide that States must take certain actions.

Possible approaches to implementing the provisions in section 179B applicable to international border areas, general
SIP requirements of section 172(c), the specific requirements in subpart 4 of part D of title I in serious PM&hyph;10
nonattainment areas, the issues involved and the means of resolving those issues are discussed in the following sections.
The topics discussed include SIP requirements such as provisions to assure that best available control measures
(BACM) are implemented; waivers for areas impacted by nonanthropogenic sources; treatment of international border
areas; requirements for quantitative milestones, reasonable further progress (RFP) and contingency measures.

A. Designations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 107(d) of the Act provides generally for the designation of areas of each State as attainment, nonattainment
or unclassifiable for each pollutant for which there is a national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). Certain
areas meeting the qualifications of section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act were designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10
by operation of law upon enactment of the 1990 Amendments (initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas). A 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice announcing all of the areas designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 at enactment and classified as moderate
was published on March 15, 1991 (56 FR 11101). A follow-up notice correcting some of these area designations was published
August 8, 1991 (56 FR 37654). The nonattainment areas were formally codified in 40 CFR part 81, effective January 6,
1992 (56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991). All those areas of the country not designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 at
enactment were designated unclassifiable (see section 107(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the Act).

B. Classifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once an area is designated nonattainment, section 188 of the Act outlines the process for classification of the area
and establishes the area's attainment date. In accordance with section 188(a), all PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas
are initially classified as moderate by operation of law upon their designation as nonattainment.

1. General Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A moderate area can subsequently be reclassified as a serious nonattainment area under two general conditions. First,
EPA has general discretion under section 188(b)(1) to reclassify a moderate area as a serious area at any time the Administrator
determines the area cannot practicably attain the NAAQS by the statutory attainment date for moderate areas.

The EPA's interpretation of the reclassification provisions in section 188(b)(1) is discussed in detail in section
III.C.1(b) of the General Preamble (57 FR at 13537&hyph;38).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, under section 188(b)(2) a moderate area is reclassified as serious by operation of law after the statutory
attainment date has passed if the Administrator finds that the area has not attained the NAAQS. The EPA must publish
a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice identifying the areas that have failed to attain and were reclassified, within 6 months following the attainment
date (see section 188(b)(2)(B)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Reclassification of Initial PM&hyph;10 Nonattainment Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 188(b)(1)(A) provides an accelerated schedule by which EPA is to reclassify appropriate initial PM&hyph;10
nonattainment areas. The EPA proposed on November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58656) to reclassify 14 of the 70 initial moderate
areas as serious. The 14 areas EPA proposed to reclassify were identified largely based on the magnitude and frequency
of ambient PM&hyph;10 measurements above the 24-hour NAAQS of 150 micrograms per cubic meter (&mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) during calendar years 1988&hyph;1990. The EPA took final action on January 8, 1993 (58 FR 3334) to reclassify 5 of
the 14 areas. The final decision to reclassify the 5 areas was based on the criteria utilized in the proposal, comments
received in response to the proposal and on EPA's preliminary review of the SIP's for the areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the future, EPA anticipates that, generally, any decision to reclassify an initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
area before the attainment date will be based on specific facts or circumstances demonstrating that the NAAQS cannot
practicably be attained in the area by December 31, 1994 (the statutory attainment date specified in section 188(c)(1)
for initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Reclassification of Future PM&hyph;10 Nonattainment Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 188(b)(1)(B) provides a timeframe within which EPA is to reclassify appropriate areas designated nonattainment
for PM&hyph;10 subsequent to enactment of the 1990 Amendments. Appropriate areas are to be reclassified as serious
within 18 months after the required date for the State's submission of a moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The statute requires that these moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP's be submitted within 18 months after the area is designated
nonattainment (see section 189(a)(2)(B)). Taking these provisions together, the statute thus requires that EPA
reclassify appropriate PM&hyph;10 moderate areas designated nonattainment after 1990 as serious within 3 years
of such designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This directive does not restrict EPA's general authority, but simply specifies that it is to be exercised, as appropriate,
in accordance with certain dates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the moderate area SIP's are due before this reclassification deadline, EPA anticipates that any determination
that such areas should be reclassified will be based upon facts contained in the moderate area SIP demonstrating that
the NAAQS cannot practicably be attained by the statutory deadline. The EPA may also consider reclassifying moderate
areas for which a SIP has not been submitted whenever it becomes apparent (e.g., because of an extensive delay in submitting
the SIP) that an area cannot practicably attain the standards by the applicable attainment date. The EPA may also determine
that an area cannot practicably attain the standards by the applicable date when the State submits an incomplete or
otherwise inadequate SIP for the area (i.e., a SIP which would not assure timely attainment) and the State does not
act expeditiously to correct such deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA does not believe that generally reclassifying moderate areas as serious rewards areas which delay development
and implementation of PM&hyph;10 control measures. Rather, EPA believes its policy creates an incentive for the
timely submittal and effective implementation of moderate area SIP requirements and facilitates the PM&hyph;10
attainment objective. For example, if an area that fails to submit a timely moderate area SIP is reclassified, this
does not obviate the requirement that the area submit and implement the moderate area SIP requirements. Accordingly,
in addition to reclassifying such areas, EPA would also determine that the State had failed to submit a PM&hyph;10
SIP and the area could be subject to sanctions under sections 110(m) and 179 for its delay. As provided under section
179(a) of the Act, States containing areas for which EPA has made such determinations have up to 18 months from EPA's
determination to submit a complete plan or plan revision before EPA is required to impose either the highway funding
sanction or the requirement to provide two-to-one new source offsets described in section 179(b). If the deficiency
has not been corrected 6 months after the first sanction applies, then the second sanction must apply.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The EPA's determination also triggers a requirement for EPA to impose a Federal implementation plan under section
110(c)(1) of the Act. In conjunction with the possible imposition of sanctions, EPA may issue a determination to reclassify
the area to serious.

D. Appendix K and Waivers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix K to 40 CFR part 50 provides guidance on the interpretation of ambient air quality data to determine the air
quality status of an area. Appendix K and accompanying guidance (both preceding the 1990 Amendments to the Act) provide
in part that measured exceedances of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS which are believed to be influenced by uncontrollable events
caused by natural sources of particulate matter or by events that are not expected to recur at a given location are flagged
and excluded from decisions as to whether or not the area should be designated nonattainment.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, if it is established that exceedances are caused by natural sources, a State may be permitted to avoid designating
the area as nonattainment, even though the exceedances are expected to recur.

The savings provision of section 193 of the amended Act provides, among other things, that regulations and guidance
promulgated or issued by the Administrator prior to enactment of the 1990 Amendments are to remain in effect according
to their terms except to the extent that they are inconsistent with any provision of the amended Act. Section 188(f)
of the amended Act provides EPA with the discretionary authority to waive a specific date of attainment for a PM&hyph;10
nonattainment area where it is determined that nonanthropogenic sources contribute significantly to the violation
of the standard in the area, and to waive certain nonattainment area SIP requirements where the Administrator determines
that anthropogenic sources of PM&hyph;10 do not contribute significantly to the violation of the standard in the
area. These provisions take as a fundamental premise that areas experiencing violations of the NAAQS due to nonanthropogenic
sources are to be designated as nonattainment. If areas were permitted to avoid being designated as nonattainment
because their violations are caused in whole or part by uncontrollable natural events, then this statutory provision
would have to be read as having no legal effect or significance. However, this would violate canons of statutory construction,
which direct that statutory language not be treated as mere surplusage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, although appendix K appears to be preserved in part by section 193, the provision permitting the treatment
of ``uncontrollable events caused by natural sources'' as exceptional events, and therefore excludable from nonattainment
decisions, is inconsistent with the provisions of section 188(f) and should therefore be regarded as no longer having
legal effect. Similarly, any EPA guidance permitting such exclusion of these events is inconsistent with the amended
Act. For this reason, exceedances which are attributable to uncontrollable nonanthropogenic events may not be discounted
or deweighted in any manner, but must be fully considered in determining whether violations of the NAAQS have occurred
and whether designation as nonattainment is warranted. Future determinations relevant to exceptional events should
therefore focus on the remaining type of exceptional event identified under section 2.4 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix
K, namely whether the events_anthropogenic or nonanthropogenic_are likely to recur at the same location.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 818 of the 1990 Amendments added a new section, 179B, to subpart 1, part D of title I. Section 179B applies to
areas that could attain the relevant NAAQS by the statutory attainment date but for emissions emanating from outside
the United States (U.S.). For PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas, section 179B(a) provides that EPA must approve the
moderate area SIP if (1) the SIP meets all the applicable requirements under the Act other than a requirement that such
plan or revision demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable attainment date,
and (2) the State demonstrates to EPA's satisfaction that the SIP would be adequate to attain and maintain the PM&hyph;10
NAAQS by the attainment date but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S. In addition, section 179B(d) provides
that if a State demonstrates that an area would have timely attained the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS but for emissions emanating
from outside the U.S., the area must not be subject to the reclassification provisions of section 188(b)(2). Section
188(b)(2) provides that any moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area that EPA determines is not in attainment after
the applicable attainment date shall be reclassified to serious by operation of law. Therefore, the statute provides
that areas that could attain but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S. must not be reclassified as serious
after failing to attain by the applicable date.

As noted, section 179B(d) states that areas demonstrating attainment of the standards, but for emissions emanating
from outside the U.S., shall not be subject to section 188(b)(2) (reclassification for failure to attain). By analogy
to this provision and applying canons of statutory construction, EPA will not reclassify before the applicable attainment
date areas which can demonstrate attainment of the standards, but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S. (see
section 188(b)(1)). First, section 179B evinces a general congressional intent not to penalize areas where emissions
emanating from outside the country are the but-for cause of the PM&hyph;10 nonattainment problems. Further, if EPA
were to reclassify such areas before the applicable attainment date, EPA, in effect, would be reading section 179B(d)
out of the statute. Specifically, if EPA proceeded to reclassify, before the applicable attainment date, those areas
qualifying for treatment under section 179B, an area would never be subject to the provision in section 179B(d) which
prohibits EPA from reclassifying such areas after the applicable attainment date. Canons of statutory construction
counsel against interpreting the law such that language is rendered mere surplusage. Finally, note that section
179B(d) contains a clearly erroneous reference to carbon monoxide instead of PM&hyph;10, and that this section contains
other clear errors (see, e.g., section 179B(c) reference to section 186(b)(9), which does not exist).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assuming that a plan or revision meets all applicable requirements, the State must show that an area is eligible to
have its SIP approved and not be reclassified as serious under section 179B by evaluating the impact of emissions emanating
from outside the U.S. and demonstrating that the SIP would bring about attainment but for those emissions. Several
types of information may be used to evaluate the impact of emissions emanating from outside the U.S. The EPA will consider
the information presented by the State for individual nonattainment areas on a case-by-case basis in determining
whether an area may qualify for treatment under section 179B. Five examples of such information are listed below in
increasing order of sophistication (the State may use one or more of these types of information or other techniques,
depending on their feasibility and applicability, to evaluate the impact of emissions emanating from outside the
U.S. on the nonattainment area; the first three examples do not require the State to obtain information from a foreign
country): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Place several ambient PM&hyph;10 monitors and a meteorological station, measuring wind speed and direction,
in the U.S. nonattainment area near the international border.

 Evaluate and quantify any changes in monitored PM&hyph;10 concentrations with a change in the predominant wind direction.

2. Comprehensively inventory PM&hyph;10 emissions within the U.S. in the vicinity of the nonattainment area and
demonstrate that the impact of those sources on the nonattainment area after application of reasonably available
controls does not cause the NAAQS to be exceeded. This analysis must include an influx of background PM&hyph;10 in
the area. Background PM&hyph;10 levels could be based, for example, on concentrations measured in a similar nearby
area not influenced by emissions from outside the U.S.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Analyze ambient sample filters for specific types of particles emanating from across the border (although not
required, characteristics of emissions from foreign sources may be helpful).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Inventory the sources on both sides of the border and compare the magnitude of PM&hyph;10 emissions originating
within the U.S. to those emanating from outside the U.S.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Perform air dispersion and/or receptor modeling to quantify the relative impacts on the nonattainment area of
sources located within the U.S. and of foreign sources of PM&hyph;10 emissions (this approach combines information
collected from the international emission inventory, meteorological stations, ambient monitoring network, and
analysis of filters).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to demonstrating that the SIP for the area would be adequate to timely attain and maintain the NAAQS but
for emissions emanating outside the U.S., the SIP must continue to meet all applicable moderate area SIP requirements
in order to qualify for the special SIP approval under section 179B. Among other things, the SIP must provide for the
implementation of reasonably available control measures (RACM), including reasonably available control technology
(RACT) (see 57 FR 13540). In international border areas, RACM/RACT must be implemented to the extent necessary to
demonstrate attainment by the applicable attainment date if emissions emanating from outside the U.S. were not included
in the analysis. The EPA believes that this interpretation of the degree of RACM the State is required to implement
in moderate PM&hyph;10 areas affected by emissions emanating from outside the U.S. is consistent with the purpose
of section 179B. By directing EPA, under section 179B, to approve the plan or plan revision of a moderate PM&hyph;10
area which shows it would attain the NAAQS but for foreign emissions and by excluding such an area from reclassification
to serious, Congress clearly wanted to avoid penalizing States containing such areas by not making them responsible
for control of emissions emanating from a foreign country over which they have no jurisdiction. Moreover, by excluding
the area from reclassification, Congress also elected to avoid subjecting such areas to the more stringent control
measures applicable in serious PM&hyph;10 areas. In addition, as set forth in section 179B(a)(2), the second condition
which must be met before EPA may approve a moderate area plan showing attainment but for foreign emissions, by its plain
terms, requires the State to establish only that the plan submitted would be ``adequate'' to timely attain and maintain
the NAAQS, but for emissions from outside the U.S. Nothing in section 179B relieves the State from meeting all its applicable
moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements, including the requirement to implement RACM. Nonetheless, if, in doing
so, States containing such an area were also required, because of contributions to PM&hyph;10 violations caused
by foreign emissions, to shoulder more of a regulatory and economic burden than States not similarly affected (i.e.,
by implementing measures which go well beyond those which the SIP demonstrates would otherwise be adequate to timely
attain and maintain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS) such a requirement would unfairly penalize States containing international
border areas and effectively undermine the purpose of section 179B. Indeed, to the extent an affected State can satisfactorily
demonstrate that implementation of such measures clearly would not advance the attainment date, EPA could conclude
they are unreasonable and hence do not constitute RACM. Notwithstanding the above, in light of the overall health
and clean air objectives of the Act, EPA does encourage affected States to reduce emissions beyond the minimum necessary
to satisfy the ``but for'' test in order to reduce the PM&hyph;10 concentrations to which their populations are exposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP for an international border area must also include contingency measures as required under section 172(c)(9)
of the Act. Under section 179B(a)(1), such SIP's must meet ``all the requirements applicable to it under the Act''
except that they may demonstrate timely attainment by discounting emissions emanating from outside the U.S. Contingency
measures are additional measures included in the SIP that can be undertaken to reduce emissions if the area fails to
make RFP or to attain the primary NAAQS by the applicable attainment date. In international border areas, EPA will
not require the contingency measures for PM&hyph;10 to be implemented after the area fails to attain if EPA determines
that the area would have attained the NAAQS, but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S. However, the EPA will
require contingency measures to be implemented if it determines that the area failed to make RFP in achieving the required
reductions in PM&hyph;10 emissions from sources within the U.S., or if the area does not, in fact, obtain the emission
reductions that were necessary to demonstrate timely attainment of the NAAQS, but for emissions emanating from outside
the U.S.

IV. Serious Area SIP Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to submit several SIP revisions, as necessary, providing for implementation of increasingly
stringent control measures and demonstrating when those control measures will bring about attainment of the PM&hyph;10
NAAQS. The first SIP revision was due November 15, 1991 for the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas.
For areas redesignated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 in the future under section 107(d)(3), the first SIP revision
will be due within 18 months after the area is redesignated (see section 189(a)(2)). This SIP revision must, among
other things, provide for implementation of RACM on sources in the area (see sections 189(a)(1)(C) and 172(c)(1)).
All available technologically and economically feasible control measures would be considered RACM, and therefore
reasonable for adoption, for areas that cannot attain the NAAQS by the applicable attainment date (December 31, 1994
for initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas) (see 57 FR 13544).

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Note that if it can be shown that measures are unreasonable because emissions from the sources affected are insignificant
or de minimis, such measures may be excluded from consideration as they would not represent RACM for that area (see
57 FR 13540). Moreover, in international border areas, measures which go beyond those which the SIP demonstrates
would be adequate to attain and maintain the standard, but for emissions emanating from outside the U.S., would not
be considered ``reasonably'' available_and therefore would not be required by RACM_since they would not advance
the attainment date (although States may elect to implement such measures in order to reduce the public's exposure
to PM&hyph;10) (see discussion under International Border Areas of this guidance document).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If EPA determines that a moderate area cannot practicably attain the NAAQS by the applicable attainment date (or determines
the area has failed to attain) and reclassifies the area as a serious nonattainment area under section 188(b), a second
SIP revision for the area is required under section 189(b). This revision must, among other things, include provisions
to assure that BACM (including BACT) will be implemented in the area (see section 189(b)(1)(B)). In addition, a demonstration
(including air quality modeling) must be submitted showing that the plan will attain the NAAQS either by the applicable
attainment date or, if an extension is granted under section 188(e), by the most expeditious alternative date practicable
(see section 189(b)(1)(A)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP revisions to require the implementation of BACM must be submitted to EPA within 18 months after an area is reclassified
as serious (see section 189(b)(2)). The BACM are to be implemented no later than 4 years after an area is reclassified
(see section 189(b)(1)(B)). The EPA's policies regarding the requirement to implement BACM in serious areas are
discussed in section VI of this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The serious area attainment demonstration required under section 189(b)(1)(A) must be submitted to EPA within 4
years after an area is reclassified based on a determination by EPA that the area cannot practicably attain the NAAQS
by the statutory deadline for moderate areas. It is due within 18 months after an area is reclassified for actually
having failed to attain the NAAQS by the moderate area attainment date (see section 189(b)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new attainment date for initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas that are reclassified as serious is to be as expeditious
as practicable but not later than December 31, 2001. For areas that are designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 in
the future and subsequently become serious, the attainment date is to be as expeditious as practicable but no later
than the end of the tenth calendar year beginning after the area's designation as nonattainment (see section 188(c)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of EPA that attainment by the statutory deadline for serious areas (as
set forth in section 188(c) of the Act) is impracticable, the State must demonstrate that the SIP provides for attainment
by the most expeditious alternative date practicable. The State may apply to EPA for a single extension of the serious
area attainment date, under section 188(e) of the Act, not to exceed 5 years beyond the serious area attainment date.
A State requesting an extension under section 188(e) for an area must, among other things, demonstrate that the plan
for the area includes the most stringent measures that are included in the implementation plan of any State or are achieved
in practice in any State, and can feasibly be implemented in the area. The EPA intends to issue guidance in the future,
as appropriate, on applying for an extension of the serious area attainment date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a serious area fails to attain by the applicable attainment date (which may be an extended attainment date), another
SIP revision is required within 12 months that provides for attainment and until then for annual reductions in PM&hyph;10
or PM&hyph;10 precursor emissions within the area of not less than 5 percent of the amount of such emissions as reported
in the most recent emission inventory for the area (see section 189(d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the specific PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements contained in subpart 4 of part D, title I, States containing
serious areas must meet all of the applicable general SIP requirements set forth in section 110(a)(2) and the nonattainment
area SIP requirements set forth in subpart 1 of part D, title I, to the extent that these provisions are not otherwise
subsumed by, or integrally related to, the more specific PM&hyph;10 requirements.

Subsequent to adopting requirements for BACM shortly after the nonattainment area is reclassified as serious, it

attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in accordance with section 189(b)(1)(A)(i). If the State demonstrates, in accordance

and seeks an extension of the attainment date pursuant to section 188(e), the State must demonstrate to the best of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Historical Perspectives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA in the past focused much of its air pollution control efforts on industrial point source emissions and other
traditional sources of air pollution.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For instance, EPA's 1977 guidance on SIP development gave priority to control of urban fugitive dust after control
of traditional sources, but in preference to rural fugitive dust, on the grounds that (1) urban soil was believed to
be contaminated and, therefore, potentially more harmful than the native soils in rural areas; (2) the potential
for significant population exposures and attendant health effects was much greater in urban areas; and (3) scarce
resources at the Federal, State, and local agency levels could be most effectively brought to bear on the more pronounced
problems found in urban areas.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Accordingly, EPA's policy was to require greater emphasis on control of emissions in urban areas, including control
of fugitive dust from all major sources. In contrast, control requirements for rural areas were far less ambitious,
focussing on the control of major industrial sources, with little attention given to natural or nonindustrial emissions.
This policy of giving a lower priority to controlling natural or nonindustrial emissions in rural areas became known
as the ``Rural Fugitive Dust Policy.''

The EPA distinguished between ``traditional'' and ``nontraditional'' sources. The term ``nontraditional source''
first appeared in official print in 1976 in EPA's ``National Assessment of the Urban Particulate Problem,'' EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;76&hyph;024,
July 1976, and was coined as a catch-all to refer to those sources not traditionally considered in air pollution control
strategies, including construction and demolition, tailpipe emissions, tire wear, and various sources of fugitive
dust. Since then, the use of the term has expanded to include such sources as prescribed agricultural and silvicultural
burning, open burning, and residential wood combustion.

The EPA's policy focus shifted away from the type and location of the emission sources (i.e., traditional or nontraditional
sources, urban or rural locations) to the size of the particles emitted when the indicator for the NAAQS was changed
in 1987 from total suspended particulate matter to PM&hyph;10. While revisions to the rural fugitive dust policy
were being considered, the policy was continued during the initial phases of implementing the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS on
an interim basis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, EPA believes that the 1990 Amendments provide a statutory alternative that wholly supplants the rural fugitive
dust policy (see sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(f) of the amended Act; 56 FR 37659 (August 8, 1991)).

B. Waiver Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act, as amended in November 1990, was designed to assure that attainment and maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 standards,
which were promulgated in 1987 (52 FR 24634, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1, 1987), be as expeditious as practicable. Thus, the Act requires States to submit several revisions of the SIP
for PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas, if necessary, to ensure attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS as expeditiously
as practicable. Among other planning requirements, the SIP revisions must first provide for the implementation
of RACM on PM&hyph;10 sources. If RACM is not adequate to attain the NAAQS, subsequent revisions must provide for implementation
of additional, more stringent control measures until the NAAQS are attained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress recognized that there may be areas where the NAAQS may never be attained because of PM&hyph;10 emissions
from ``nonanthropogenic sources,''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
19
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and that the imposition in such areas of certain State planning requirements, as described in the previous section,
may not be justified. Therefore, under section 188(f) of the Act, Congress provided a means for EPA to waive a specific
date for attainment and certain control and planning requirements when certain conditions are met in the nonattainment
area.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislative history of the 1990 Amendments indicates that Congress intended that the term ``nonanthropogenic''
sources of PM&hyph;10 refer to activities where the human role in the cause of such emissions is highly attenuated
[see H.R. Rep. No. 490, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 265 (1990)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 188(f) provides two types of waivers. First, the Administrator may, on a case-by-case basis, waive any requirement
under subpart 4 applicable to any serious nonattainment area where EPA determines that anthropogenic sources of
PM&hyph;10 do not contribute significantly to the violation of the standard in the area. Second, the Administrator
may waive a specific date for attainment of the standard where EPA determines that nonanthropogenic sources of PM&hyph;10
contribute significantly to the violation of the standard in the area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 188(f) contains two different legal tests. The first test applies to a waiver of the serious area requirements
and requires that EPA determine that anthropogenic sources do not contribute significantly before EPA grants such
a waiver. The second test applies to a waiver of an area's attainment date and requires that EPA determine that nonanthropogenic
sources contribute significantly before waiving the attainment date. The first test is more stringent than the second.

C. Application of the Waiver Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several questions must be answered before the waiver provisions can be applied. Each of these questions is discussed
in the subsections that follow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What types of sources should be considered anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history of the 1990 Amendments indicates that Congress intended that the term ``nonanthropogenic''
sources of PM&hyph;10 refer to activities where the human role in the cause of such emissions is highly attenuated
(see H.R. Rep. No. 490 at 265). Naturally occurring events such as wildfires, volcanic eruptions, unusually high
pollen counts, and high winds which generate dust from undisturbed land are examples of nonanthropogenic sources
that EPA believes meet the intent of Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anthropogenic sources of PM&hyph;10 emissions are those resulting from human activities. Some of the traditional
and nontraditional anthropogenic sources generally considered in PM&hyph;10 SIP's are commercial, institutional,
and residential fuel combustion; fossil fuel-fired electric power plants; industrial processes; vehicular traffic
on paved and unpaved roads; construction activities; agricultural activities; and other sources of fugitive dust
which are directly traceable to human activities and which are reasonably foreseeable incidents of such activities.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. What criteria should be used in determining when nonanthropogenic sources contribute significantly and when
anthropogenic sources do not contribute significantly to violation of the NAAQS in the area? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act does not define the term ``contribute significantly'' as it is used in section 188(f), nor does the legislative
history provide any useful guidance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
21 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where a statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the meaning of a statutory term, a reasonable agency interpretation
of the term must be given deference by a reviewing court (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Chevron U.S.A., Inc.

 v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 467 U.S. 837, 842&hyph;845 (1984)). The EPA thus believes it has the authority to select reasonable criteria by which
to determine when nonanthropogenic/anthropogenic sources in an area do/do not ``contribute significantly'' to
levels of pollution which exceed the NAAQS, as well as to consider for this purpose, criteria utilized in other statutory
contexts. In light of the different legal tests set forth in section 188(f), the EPA believes that different indicators
of significance are needed to serve the statutory purpose of encouraging protection of public health and welfare
while avoiding unreasonable control actions. The criteria which EPA believes provide a reasonable approach to making
such a determination, as well as a discussion of the basis for selecting these criteria, are set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->
21
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
It should be noted that the term ``contribute significantly'' (or variations of that term) has been interpreted differently
throughout the Act, e.g., in the ozone/carbon monoxide programs (see section 107(d)(4)(A)(iv) and (v)), the new
source review (NSR) program, and in specific provisions of the statute, such as sections 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) and
126(a)(1)(B). An agency is permitted, but not required, to give a similar meaning to similar terms which appear in
different parts of a statute. Thus, although EPA is not bound to adopt the interpretation given the term ``contribute
significantly'' in other parts of the statute, it is likewise not precluded from according this use of similar language
some interpretive weight.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, where a nonattainment area's anthropogenic sources contribute very little to violations, it is likely
that controlling those emissions to the extent feasible for the area will be insufficient to attain the NAAQS. In such
cases, it would be unreasonable to require the area to implement more stringent and more expensive controls on anthropogenic
sources since they would contribute little to attainment or to reducing the public's exposure to unhealthy air quality.
In similar fashion, where nonanthropogenic emission contributions are great, even after the area has taken reasonable
steps to reduce them, at some point it may not be feasible for the area to reduce nonanthropogenic (or anthropogenic)
emissions sufficiently to effect any real change in ambient concentrations. Consequently, it would be unreasonable
to require the area to continue to pursue control measures that are beyond the area's practicable abilities. These
principles are discussed below in connection with each of the two waiver tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In selecting an appropriate ``significance'' contribution from anthropogenic sources (for the purposes of deciding
whether serious area requirements should be waived), EPA has elected to rely on the test of significance that is applied
under new source permitting programs. Under the new source review (NSR) permit program, the EPA requires State permitting
programs to consider new major sources or major modifications as causing or contributing to a violation of the PM&hyph;10
NAAQS when the source would add, at a minimum, over 5 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3 to the 24-hour average or over 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3 to the annual average PM&hyph;10 concentrations in an area that does not or would not meet the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS
(see 40 CFR 51.165(b)). Given that the purpose of new source permitting programs is also to protect air quality in both
attainment and nonattainment areas, EPA generally believes that the test of significant contribution to violations
under that program should also be applicable when determining significant contributions of anthropogenic sources
under section 188(f) of the Act. It should also be noted that, in determining ``significance'' for purposes of section
188(f), the plain terms of that provision and its underlying purpose dictate that EPA consider the impact of the anthropogenic
sources as a whole. Consequently, where emissions from all anthropogenic sources as a whole contribute less than
or equal to 5 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3 to 24-hour average design concentrations and less than or equal to 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3 to annual mean design concentrations in a nonattainment area, after all RACM have been implemented,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA will generally regard such contributions as insignificant for purposes of waiving requirements applicable
to serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas pursuant to section 188(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->
22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of RACM (including RACT) is required in all moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas and that requirement
is not waived under the provisions of section 188(f). Therefore, the issue is whether anthropogenic sources still
contribute significantly to violations of the NAAQS in an area, after implementing RACM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, if an area meeting this test has not yet been reclassified as serious and the area would qualify under this
test for a waiver of certain serious area requirements as deemed appropriate by EPA (see discussion below), then EPA
will not require reclassification, since that action would have no practical effect. Generally, if the contribution
of anthropogenic emissions to the 24-hour design concentration exceeds 5 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3, or if the contribution to the annual design concentration exceeds 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3, even after the application of all RACM, then the area should be reclassified as serious, and serious area requirements,
including BACM, should be implemented. The EPA will consider exercising its authority to waive serious area requirements
on a case-by-case basis where the anthropogenic source contribution exceeds these levels, and it can be persuasively
demonstrated that because of unique circumstances, anthropogenic sources do not contribute significantly to violations
of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA will consider nonanthropogenic sources to contribute significantly (and hence grant an attainment date
waiver) only if, after the application of RACM to nonanthropogenic sources, their contribution to the 24-hour average
design concentration exceeds 150 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3, or their contribution to the annual mean design concentration exceeds 50 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3. Because the basic purpose of title I is to protect public health and welfare through attainment and maintenance
of the NAAQS, EPA believes that before it may generally presume a serious area's nonanthropogenic emissions contribution
to be significant, that contribution should by itself prevent the area from attaining the NAAQS after reasonable
steps have been taken to reduce or minimize their impacts. Areas which do not meet the above criteria, and other situations
for which the general presumption is rebutted, will be reviewed on a case-by case basis (see question 4 below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information derived from chemical and optical analyses of ambient filter catches, area emission inventories, and
dispersion modeling to determine maximum source impacts can be used to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic
sources. Analysis of filters collected with a network of monitors over a long period (1 or more years) should reveal
the portions of normal area PM&hyph;10 concentrations attributable to background, nonanthropogenic, and anthropogenic
sources, respectively.

3. Under what conditions will the attainment date for a moderate area be waived? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effect of waiving the attainment date for a moderate area is to relieve it of the serious area requirements. Therefore,
special considerations apply to the determination of whether nonanthropogenic sources contribute significantly
to violation of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in a moderate area and whether such area therefore qualifies for an attainment
date waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The significant disparity between the legal tests set out in section 188(f), as discussed above, may lead to an absurd
result. In particular, if a moderate area met the less stringent attainment date waiver test and the attainment date
for the area was actually waived, the area would never be reclassified.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 The result would be that a moderate area would be effectively relieved from the serious area requirements without
having met the more stringent test that Congress expressly required be met as a prerequisite to a waiver of such requirements.
In such an event, the more stringent test for determining whether to waive serious area requirements would be rendered
meaningless. Moderate areas would qualify for the attainment date waiver, be effectively relieved of all serious
area requirements and never have to meet the required test for such waiver.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
If EPA waives a specific attainment date for a moderate area consistent with its authority under section 188(f), the
attainment date for the area will be vacated. Therefore, the moderate area would not be subject to reclassification
under section 188(b) because there simply would be no attainment date that the area cannot practicably meet or that
the area fails to meet. However, since section 188(f) authorizes waiving only the attainment date, the moderate area
would still be subject to all the remaining moderate area SIP requirements. Therefore, the moderate area SIP submitted
to meet the applicable requirements of subparts 1 and 4 must, among other requirements, continue to provide for implementation
of RACM.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To avoid this absurd result and only grant a waiver of the serious area requirements consistent with the legal standard
set out in the Act, EPA has construed section 188(f) in the following manner. A moderate area may only qualify for an
attainment date waiver if it also qualifies for a waiver of the serious area requirements. Therefore, EPA must determine
that anthropogenic sources in the area do not contribute significantly to the violation of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS,
and the serious area requirements should be waived before EPA can grant an attainment date waiver for a moderate area.
If such a determination is made, then the attainment date may be waived and the area would not be reclassified. These
special considerations would not be relevant where EPA is determining whether to waive the attainment date for a serious
area since waiving the date in such circumstances would not as a matter of course have the effect of relieving the area
of the serious area requirements. An area already reclassified as serious could qualify for an attainment date waiver
solely by showing that nonanthropogenic emissions contribute significantly to the nonattainment problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of its policy, EPA will require that areas receiving waivers be revisited periodically to reevaluate source
contributions, to ensure that source emissions growth is reasonably controlled, and to determine whether additional
controls to reduce the public's exposure to high concentrations of PM&hyph;10 are available (see also the discussion
under question 5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What happens if an area cannot meet the general criteria described above? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If evidence in a given nonattainment area suggests that nonanthropogenic emissions may contribute significantly
to violations but are not greater than 150 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and/or anthropogenic source contributions are relatively small but not less than 5 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, then EPA will review the situation on a case-by-case basis taking into account relevant information such as the relative
contribution of nonanthropogenic emissions/anthropogenic emissions and the effects of applying additional controls
to both types of sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For moderate areas, if preliminary data (emission inventory, filter analysis, etc.) persuasively indicate that
anthropogenic emissions may be insignificant and that nonanthropogenic emissions may be significant in an area,
but such data are not decisive, then EPA will consider granting a temporary or conditional waiver of the moderate area
attainment date for no more than 3 years to allow further evaluation of the situation. Prior to granting a temporary
waiver, EPA and the State must agree on a protocol for evaluating the impacts of anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic
emissions. The protocol must include a schedule with interim milestones by which the State will complete its analyses.
The schedule should consider the need for the area to adopt and implement BACM so as to meet the applicable serious area
attainment date (as expeditiously as practicable and, for those areas designated nonattainment under section 107(d)(4)(B),
no later than December 31, 2001) in the event the evaluation demonstrates that nonanthropogenic emissions do not
contribute significantly to violations in the area. If the evaluation conclusively demonstrates that nonanthropogenic
emissions are significant, then a waiver of the serious area attainment date may be granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If it is shown for any moderate nonattainment area that, although nonanthropogenic emissions may be significant,
the application of controls on anthropogenic sources would appreciably reduce PM&hyph;10 concentrations in the
area, then the area would not be granted a waiver of the moderate area attainment date, but would be reclassified as
serious. The area would then be required to implement BACM on non-de minimis anthropogenic source categories (see
discussion in section VI). However, subsequent to such reclassification, the area may later apply for a waiver of
the serious area attainment date if it can demonstrate that even after implementing BACM (and after considering the
extended attainment and post-attainment provisions of sections 188 and 189 of the Act), nonanthropogenic emissions
will prevent the area from attaining the NAAQS.

5. For what period may a specific attainment date be waived? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When nonanthropogenic sources have been determined to contribute significantly to violations in an area that has
been reclassified to serious, in accordance with the above criteria, those sources may permanently prevent the area
from attaining the standards. Therefore, the attainment date for such areas could be waived indefinitely.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
24
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``However, the phrase waive a specific date'' does not require that the attainment date be waived indefinitely (see
footnote 23 on the effect of waiving the moderate area attainment date), nor does it lessen the State's obligation
to strive to expeditiously attain the NAAQS at some time in the future through available means. While EPA does not expect
States to exhaust their resources to meet standards that may be unattainable, it does expect them to continue efforts
to minimize exposures to unhealthy air.

In cases where it is feasible to implement measures that will reduce future emissions from nonanthropogenic sources
(i.e., planting indigenous vegetation or establishing wind breaks), EPA has the authority under section 188(e)
to extend the attainment date for a serious area for up to 5 years beyond 2001 if it is possible that the NAAQS could be
attained in the future. Such measures should be considered by States before seeking waivers of the attainment date.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Even though a specific attainment date and serious area requirements may be waived indefinitely for an area where,
respectively, nonanthropogenic sources contribute significantly to violations and anthropogenic sources do
not, the State should review the status of anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic source contributions in the area every

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3 years. Such a review would entail determining whether nonanthropogenic sources still contribute significantly
and anthropogenic sources do not contribute significantly to violation of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in the area. Since
emissions from anthropogenic sources increase with population growth and the location of new sources to the area,
the contribution of anthropogenic sources to violations can become significant over time. Therefore, the need for
reinstating a specific attainment date and/or previously waived serious area requirements should be reconsidered
periodically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has the authority under section 172(c)(3) to require periodic updates of a nonattainment area's emissions
inventory to assure that the requirements of part D are met. The EPA plans to use this authority to periodically review
the waiver status of areas, as described above. A specific attainment date and applicable requirements should be
reinstated if it is determined that nonanthropogenic sources no longer contribute significantly or anthropogenic
sources begin contributing significantly to violations in the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The individual subpart 4 requirements (see section IV. above) will be waived only after considering all relevant
circumstances on a case-by-case basis for serious areas where anthropogenic sources do not contribute significantly
and where RACM have been implemented. Currently, the section 189(b)(3) requirement to modify the definitions of
``major source'' and ``major stationary source'' is the only serious area requirement that will not be waived.

D. Waiver Policy Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the discussion above, the EPA intends to implement its authority to grant waivers under section 188(f)
in a manner described by the diagram presented in Figure 1. It is important to note that this diagram is provided for
illustrative purposes only and should not be interpreted contrary to the policy as it is described in this notice.
The figure presents six decision questions. A SIP submitted for a moderate nonattainment area seeking a waiver is
expected to address the first three questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Can the area attain the NAAQS by the applicable statutory attainment date (December 31, 1994 for the initial nonattainment
areas) after implementing RACM (including RACT) for contributing anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic sources?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the moderate area SIP demonstrates that the area can attain with RACM (including RACT) by the attainment date, then
the answer to this question is ``yes'' and the waiver provisions are not applicable.

If an area cannot attain by the statutory deadline, then questions 2 and 3 on the waiver policy diagram must be addressed,
and several cases may exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Do anthropogenic sources of PM&hyph;10 as a whole contribute significantly to violations in the area?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Do nonanthropogenic sources of PM&hyph;10 as a whole contribute significantly to violations in the area?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

If anthropogenic sources no longer contribute significantly to violations in the area after the implementation
of RACM, then by default, nonanthropogenic sources must contribute significantly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
25
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this case, the moderate area attainment date may be waived. The practical effect of waiving the attainment date
for a moderate area is to relieve it from reclassification as serious and, therefore, to relieve it from certain serious
area requirements. Therefore, a moderate area may only qualify for an attainment date waiver if it also qualifies
for a waiver of the serious area requirements (see section V.C., question 3). The State should reevaluate the impact
of anthropogenic sources on the area periodically to determine whether or not they contribute significantly to violations.

It is likely that Congress intended all areas_even those eligible for waivers_to implement whatever measures were
reasonably available. Therefore, EPA believes the best reading of the statute requires that the emission reductions
attributable to RACM (including RACT) should be considered before evaluating the significance of anthropogenic
contributions.

requirements discussed in section IV, above, would have to be implemented in the area. These requirements include,
among other things, the application of BACM (including BACT) on source categories that are still contributing significantly
to violations (see the discussion of BACM in section VI and footnote 33).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, the area may qualify for a waiver of the serious area attainment date if it is demonstrated that nonanthropogenic

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the State can demonstrate that it is possible to attain the NAAQS by the statutory deadline for serious areas through

To answer this question, the State must determine if an extension of time will make it technologically and economically

of the attainment date allowed under section 188(e), then question 6 must be addressed.

If an area fails to attain the NAAQS by the end of the extension period, then the State must plan to achieve annual reductions
of not less than 5 percent of PM&hyph;10 and PM&hyph;10 precursor emissions within the area, as reported in the most
recent inventory (see section 189(d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To answer this question, the State must determine if the implementation of additional control measures, annually,
would eventually bring the area into attainment. Sufficient additional control measures would need to be implemented
to achieve at least 5 percent annual reductions in the inventory of PM&hyph;10 emissions from anthropogenic sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA believes that it is practicable for an area, where both anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic sources contribute
to violations, to attain the NAAQS at any time in the future, a specific attainment date would not be waived. Rather,
as discussed previously, the State would be expected to follow the provisions in sections 188 and 189 for attainment
date extensions and continued emission reductions until the NAAQS are attained. However, if emissions from anthropogenic
sources are reduced to the point that it is no longer technologically or economically feasible to reduce those emissions
further, and the area still cannot attain the NAAQS, then EPA may consider waiving the serious area attainment date
and appropriate serious area requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Requirement for BACM
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two circumstances, as discussed earlier, under which a moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area may be reclassified
as serious. First, an area may be reclassified whenever EPA determines that the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS cannot practicably
be attained by the statutory attainment date.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
28
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such a determination may be made before the attainment date if a review of the SIP for an area shows that RACM, including
RACT, will not practicably bring the area into attainment or if delays in adopting, submitting, and implementing
SIP requirements form a basis for EPA to conclude that an area cannot practicably attain the NAAQS by the statutory
attainment date. The second circumstance is when the area is reclassified by operation of law upon a determination
by EPA that the area has failed to attain the NAAQS on schedule (see section 188(b)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory attainment date for the initial group of areas designated nonattainment by operation of law upon enactment
of the 1990 Amendments, under section 107(d)(4), is December 31, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 189(b) establishes additional control requirements for PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas that are reclassified
as serious by EPA. Under section 189(b)(1)(B), States must submit SIP revisions which provide for implementation
of the BACM for PM&hyph;10 emissions in such areas. These SIP revisions must be submitted to EPA within 18 months after
an area is reclassified and must assure that the measures are implemented no later than 4 years after the area is reclassified
as serious (see section 189(b) (1) and (2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA believes the requirement to implement BACM in serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas should, in one respect,
be interpreted similarly to the comparable requirement to implement RACM in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
areas. Section 172(c)(1), which applies to all nonattainment areas, states that part D RACM shall include ``such
reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of
reasonably available control technology&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' Thus, moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
area RACM plans, which are submitted to meet the requirements of section 189(a)(1)(C), must include provisions ensuring
the adoption of RACT (see 57 FR 13540, column 1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For moderate PM&hyph;10 areas reclassified as serious, the nonattainment control requirements (i.e., RACM) are
carried over and elevated to a higher level of stringency (i.e., BACM). So, by analogy, just as RACM includes RACT,
in the same way, BACM includes BACT.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
29
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, just as moderate PM&hyph;10 SIP revisions when implementing RACM under section 189(a)(1)(C) must provide
for the adoption of RACT, similarly, PM&hyph;10 SIP revisions under section 189(b)(1)(B), implementing BACM in
serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas, must include provisions ensuring the adoption of BACT. This point was explicitly
addressed in the House Committee Report: ``Serious areas must include in their submission provisions to require
that the best available control measures for the control of PM&hyph;10 emissions are implemented no later than 4 years
after the area is classified or reclassified as serious. Such provisions must include the application of the best
available control technology to existing stationary sources'' (H.R. Rep. No. 490, 101st Cong., 2nd Sess. 266&hyph;67
(1990)).

Although section 189(b)(1)(B) requires BACM (including BACT) to be implemented in serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
areas, the Act does not define either BACM or BACT for PM&hyph;10 nonattainment purposes. Where a statute is silent
or ambiguous with respect to the meaning of a statutory term, the agency is authorized to adopt an interpretation reasonably
accommodated to the purpose of the statutory provisions.

 In considering how to interpret the provisions requiring BACM (including BACT) for serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
areas, EPA has looked at several factors: The way in which similar terms have been historically interpreted in other
sections or titles of the Act, the ordinary grammatical usage associated with the word ``best,'' and the overall structure
and purpose of title I of the statute.

B. EPA's Historical Interpretation of Control Technology Terminology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act uses several terms to refer to different levels of emission control technology required for existing or new
sources: ``reasonable (RACT),'' ``best (BACT),'' and lowest achievable emission rate (LAER). It is helpful to consider
EPA's past and current interpretation and implementation of these various control levels in determining the control
level appropriate for BACM for serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``reasonably available'' was applied to control measures and control technology required to be implemented
at existing sources in nonattainment areas by the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments (1977 Amendments) (42 U.S.C. 7502(c)(1)).
At that time, EPA defined RACT as the lowest emission limitation that a particular source is capable of meeting by the
application of technology that is reasonably available considering technological and economic feasibility.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Control measures were determined to be reasonable after considering their energy and environmental impacts and
their annualized capital and operating costs. In EPA's view, the cost of using a control measure is considered reasonable
if those same costs are borne by other comparable facilities. Since Congress, in the 1990 Amendments, did not modify
EPA's interpretations of the RACM and RACT in the earlier 1977 Amendments, it can be presumed to have given some endorsement
to EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of the term.

See, for example, 44 FR 53761&hyph;53762 (September 17, 1979) and footnote 3 of that notice. Note that EPA's emissions
trading policy statement (51 FR 43814 (December 4, 1986)) has clarified that RACT requirements may be satisfied by
achieving ``RACT equivalent'' emissions reductions in the aggregate from the full set of existing stationary sources
subject to those requirements (see also EPA's proposed economic incentives rule, 58 FR 11110, 11123 (February 23,
1993)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress defined the term ``best available control technology'' in section 169(3) of the 1977 Amendments for use
in implementing the requirement to prevent significant deterioration (PSD) of air quality under part C, title I,
of that Act. This definition was modified by section 403(d) of the 1990 Amendments. The BACT is currently defined for
the PSD program as an emission limitation based on the ``maximum degree of reduction of each pollutant *&blank;*&blank;*
emitted from or which results from any major emitting facility, which the permitting authority, on a case-by-case
basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable
for such facility through application of production processes and available methods, systems, and techniques *&blank;*&blank;*
for control of each such pollutant.'' Thus, BACT is to be determined for the PSD program on a case-by-case basis taking
into account the energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs. Section 169(3) also requires that
BACT be at least as stringent as any corresponding new source performance standard (NSPS) or national emission standard
for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the PSD program, BACT applies through preconstruction permits issued to major new and major modified facilities
in areas where the air quality is better than the NAAQS (section 165(a)(4) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7475(a)(4)). In broad
overview, BACT is determined by identifying the technologically feasible control measures, from the universe of
available control techniques, which yield the maximum degree of emission reduction, after considering the energy,
environmental and economic impacts of the technology, and other costs. This may include consideration of the annualized
capital and operating costs for the facility. The costs of control for a major new facility or major modification of
an existing facility should be considered as a portion of the overall costs of the new facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term LAER refers to the level of control required for issuing a preconstruction permit to major new or major modified
facilities in areas where the air quality is worse than the NAAQS (i.e., nonattainment areas) (section 173(a)(2)
of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7503(a)(2)). In broad terms, LAER is defined at section 171(3) of the Act as the more stringent
emission rate based on either the most stringent State emission limit or the most stringent emission limit achieved
in practice by such class or category of source. Like BACT, the LAER level of control must be at least as stringent as
the NSPS applicable to the source. Unlike RACT and BACT, the LAER requirement does not consider energy or cost factors.
In general, the costs of achieving LAER in a nonattainment area must be considered as a portion of the overall cost of
investing in a major new or major modified facility, as they are with BACT in attainment areas. The EPA believes that
it is reasonable to conclude that in selecting the term ``best'' to apply to control measures in PM&hyph;10 serious
nonattainment areas, Congress likely considered how the term has been interpreted in other sections and titles of
the Act. Several other factors (discussed below) support such a conclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. BACM for Serious PM&hyph;10 Nonattainment Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A plain-English interpretation of the term ``best'' implies a generally higher standard of performance than one
that may be considered ``reasonable.'' In addition, the structural scheme throughout title I of the Act is to require
the implementation of increasingly stringent control measures in areas with more serious pollution problems, while
providing such areas a longer time to attain the applicable standards. This structural scheme reflects a basic underlying
premise of title I. The premise is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That more stringent control measures are needed in cases when the current control requirements will be insufficient
to bring a particular area into attainment; and (2) that the more serious the air quality problem, the more reasonable
it is to require States to implement control measures of greater stringency despite the greater burdens such measures
are likely to cause. The Act attempts to balance the greater burden imposed in those areas where more stringent controls
are required by affording the State additional time to implement them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 For example, under section 188(e), EPA is given authority to extend the attainment date for a serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
area beyond the specified statutory date, provided certain conditions are met. One of those conditions is that the
State must demonstrate to EPA's satisfaction that ``the plan for that area includes the most stringent measures that
are included in the implementation plan of any State or are achieved in practice in any State, and can feasibly be implemented
in the area.'' Thus, under this section, the Act provides such areas an opportunity to receive additional time to attain
the NAAQS. The consequence of receiving additional time, however, is that the State must demonstrate that its PM&hyph;10
implementation plan contains the ``most stringent measures'' that can feasibly be implemented in the relevant area
from among those which are either included in any other SIP or have been achieved in practice by any other State.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, the Act requires the application of control measures that are ``reasonable'' in moderate PM&hyph;10
nonattainment areas (RACM) and control measures that are ``best'' (BACM) whenever a moderate area cannot ``practicably''
attain or fails to attain the NAAQS and is therefore reclassified as serious. Accordingly, for the reasons stated
above, EPA believes it is reasonable to conclude that Congress intended a greater level of stringency to apply in areas
that are required to implement ``best available'' controls than in those required only to implement controls that
are ``reasonably available.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted earlier, an array of different control measures is applicable under various title I NAAQS-related programs.
A key factor, among others, in determining the level of control appropriate for a given area from among the different
emission control measures and technologies referred to throughout title I is the severity of the air pollution problem
in that area. In addition to the general categorization of areas as ``attainment,'' ``nonattainment,'' and ``unclassifiable,''
the Act characterizes the severity of an area's air pollution problem by classifying the area, for example, as ``marginal,''
``moderate,'' ``serious,'' and so on. As discussed above, the different control measures are required to be implemented
as follows: For new (or modified) sources, BACT applies in PM&hyph;10 unclassifiable and attainment areas under
the PSD program, while LAER applies in moderate and serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas under the nonattainment
NSR program; for existing sources, RACM (including RACT) applies in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas, while
BACM (including BACT) applies in serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. In each case, the more serious the pollution
problem, the more stringent the control standard required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is apparent that in requiring the application of BACM to existing sources in serious PM&hyph;10 areas, Congress
implied that these sources should be subject to a more stringent level of control than the application of RACM required
for existing sources in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas, but not as stringent as the application of LAER
required for new or modified sources in moderate and serious nonattainment areas (or the degree of control required
to secure an extension under section 188(e)).

1. Definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In view of the preceding discussion, EPA believes that, as a starting point in interpreting BACM for PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
purposes, it is reasonable to consider the term BACT as applied in the PSD program under section 169(3) as an analogue.
Because PSD BACT and PM&hyph;10 BACM (which includes BACT) are similar terms, EPA believes it is reasonable to accord
some interpretive weight to this use of similar language.

Under accepted principles of statutory interpretation, similar terms in a statute generally suggest a similar meaning,
and an agency is permitted, but not required, to give a similar meaning to similar terms which appear in different parts
of a statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, EPA's interpretation of BACM for serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas will generally be similar to the definition of BACT for the PSD program. The BACM is
the maximum degree of emissions reduction of PM&hyph;10 and PM&hyph;10 precursors from a source (except as provided
in subsection C. 3) which is determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic
impacts and other costs, to be achievable for such source through application of production processes and available
methods, systems, and techniques for control of each such pollutant. For PM&hyph;10, BACM must be applied to existing
source categories in nonattainment areas that cannot practicably attain (or fail to attain) within the moderate
area timeframe and are reclassified as serious.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``source categories'' for which BACM will be required, refers to categories of area-wide sources or large
individual stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 or PM&hyph;10 precursor emissions that may be regulated under a specific
rule, generic emission limit, or standard of performance, or a specific control program in a SIP. For example, the
SIP may regulate emissions from unpaved roads, construction activities, residential wood combustion, asphalt
concrete batch plants, etc., as source categories. Note that, in some instances, an entire source category may consist
of one large individual stationary source that is regulated separately under the SIP such as a single iron and steel
manufacturing facility and the various processes therein.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, EPA will interpret PSD BACT and PM&hyph;10 BACM as generally similar because, despite the similarity
in terminology, certain key differences exist between control measures applicable in the PSD and PM&hyph;10 serious
nonattainment area programs. The BACT under the PSD program applies only in areas already meeting the NAAQS, while
PM&hyph;10 BACM applies in areas which are seriously violating the NAAQS. This difference in policy goals, arguably,
suggests that the PM&hyph;10 BACM control standard should be more stringent than that for PSD BACT. On the other hand,
the burden of installing efficient controls during construction of a new source or source modification is generally
less onerous than retrofitting an existing PM&hyph;10 source with similar controls. If one compares both programs
in terms of these factors, the differing regulatory and economic burdens and the different policy purposes tend to
offset each other. Nevertheless, EPA believes that the differences in policy goals_i.e., preventing further pollution
under the PSD program and reducing existing pollution under the PM&hyph;10 nonattainment program_counsel against
adopting the interpretation and implementation of PSD BACT in its entirety for PM&hyph;10 nonattainment purposes.
Rather, EPA considers it reasonable to use the approach adopted in the PSD BACT program as defined in section 169(3)
of the Act as an analogue for determining appropriate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment control measures in serious areas,
while at the same time retaining the discretion to depart from that approach on a case-by-case basis as particular
circumstances warrant.

2. Preventive Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA considers measures that prevent PM&hyph;10 emissions over the long term (e.g., requiring gas logs in new fireplaces)
to be preferable to those measures that will only temporarily reduce emissions (e.g., curtailment of wood stove use
during air pollution episodes or treatment of fugitive dust sources with water). This is because such preventive
measures are inherently more effective and involve significantly fewer resources for surveillance, enforcement,
and administration. Moreover, increasing emphasis on prevention over mitigation is more likely to be both economically
and environmentally beneficial over the long term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. De Minimis Source Categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The BACM are required for all categories of sources in serious areas unless the State adequately demonstrates that
a particular source category does not contribute significantly to nonattainment of the NAAQS. While EPA regards
the BACM standard applicable in PM&hyph;10 serious areas as a more stringent control standard which calls for a greater
degree of emissions control for the source categories to which it applies, EPA also believes that it has the authority
to limit the applicability of BACM to those source categories which ``contribute significantly'' to violations
of the NAAQS. The Act leaves unresolved the question of whether BACM is intended to be an all-inclusive requirement
applicable to every PM&hyph;10 serious area source category. It should be noted that in section 189(b)(1)(B), which
contains the requirement that serious area PM&hyph;10 SIP's provide for the implementation of BACM, Congress has
not used the word ``all'' in conjunction with BACM. Congress has also not stated anywhere in the relevant law or legislative
history that BACM must be applied to all serious area source categories. Even if the statute on its face were interpreted
to require States to impose BACM on all source categories in serious PM&hyph;10 areas, the Agency believes, based
on the decision in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that it has the authority to exempt from regulation those source categories in the area which contribute only negligibly
to ambient concentrations which exceed the NAAQS. The EPA believes the court's test for invoking the de minimis exemption
authority would be satisfied in circumstances where a State demonstrates conclusively that, because of the small
contribution of the source category's emissions to the nonattainment problem, the imposition of additional controls,
such as BACM, on a particular source category in the area would not contribute significantly to the Act's purpose of
achieving attainment of the NAAQS ``as expeditiously as practicable.'' The EPA will have to determine from the record
that, with respect to particular serious area PM&hyph;10 source categories which contribute to emissions in excess
of the NAAQS, requiring application of BACM would produce an insignificant regulatory benefit.

The EPA will, in general, rely on the criteria applied under new source permitting programs (40 CFR 51.165(b)) to determine
when a source category contributes significantly to violations of the NAAQS in a PM&hyph;10 serious nonattainment
area. The criteria will also be applied spatially and temporally in the same way it is under new source permitting programs.

As discussed above, a moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area may be reclassified as serious based on evidence that
the area cannot practicably attain the NAAQS by the statutory attainment date or evidence that it has failed to attain
by that date. The evidence, whether modeled or measured, will generally indicate the standard (24-hour or annual),
the day, and the location of the predicted or monitored violation. Therefore, under this policy, a source category
(see footnote 33) will be presumed to contribute significantly to a violation of the 24-hour NAAQS if its PM&hyph;10
impact at the location of the expected violation would exceed 5 &mu;g/m3. Likewise, a source category will be presumed
to contribute significantly to a violation of the annual NAAQS if its PM&hyph;10 impact at the time and location of
the expected violation would exceed 1 &mu;g/m3.

4. BACM Analysis Independent of Attainment Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The overall structure and purpose of title I of the amended Act, the standard suggested by the word ``best,'' and the
differences in the statute between the requirements for BACM as compared to those for RACM, lead EPA to believe that,
unlike RACM, BACM are to be established generally independent of an analysis of the attainment needs of the serious
area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted earlier in this section, the overall structural scheme throughout title I of the Act is to require the implementation
of increasingly stringent control measures in areas with more serious pollution problems, while providing such
areas additional time to attain the applicable standards. These tougher measures are deemed necessary in cases where
it appears that less stringent controls will be insufficient to reduce emissions in an area to the level of the NAAQS.
As described above, the fact that the Act requires the application of control measures that are ``reasonable'' in
moderate PM&hyph;10 areas and control measures that are ``best'' whenever it is determined that a moderate area cannot
``practicably'' attain or actually fails to attain the NAAQS and is therefore reclassified as serious, strongly
suggests that BACM is intended to be a more stringent standard than RACM. Thus, it is reasonable to interpret the statute
as requiring a different analysis for determining BACM from the practice of analyzing RACM according to what is reasonable
in light of the overall attainment needs of the area. Moreover, when comparing the terms ``reasonable'' and ``best''
as applied to control measures, the word ``best'' strongly implies that there should be a greater emphasis on the merits
of the measure or technology alone and less flexibility in considering other factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, for PM&hyph;10 areas reclassified as serious before the moderate area attainment date, States have
up to 4 years, under section 189(b)(2), in which to submit their serious area attainment demonstration. However,
under section 189(b)(2), States have only 18 months after reclassification from moderate to serious to submit their
plans requiring the use of BACM for those same areas. Thus, for such areas, Congress provided a difference of as much
as 21/2 years between the required date for submitting BACM plans and the date by which to submit a new attainment demonstration
satisfying the requirements of section 189(b)(1)(A). This pronounced difference in timing for the serious area
submittals described above is to be contrasted with the timing for submittal of similar provisions for moderate areas.
Under section 189(a)(2), both the RACM plans and the attainment demonstration for moderate PM&hyph;10 areas must
as a general matter be submitted at the same time. The fact that the Act requires BACM to be adopted and implemented by
an appreciable time before the attainment demonstration is required, for areas that are reclassified before the
moderate area attainment date, suggests that Congress intended that BACM determinations be based more on the feasibility
of implementing the measures rather than on an analysis of the attainment needs of the area.
<FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, the steps described below for making a BACM determination are intended to be carried out independently
from the analysis to determine the emission reductions that would be necessary to attain the NAAQS by the statutory
deadline. If the attainment demonstration for the area subsequently shows that BACM will bring the area into attainment
before the statutory deadline, then the plan provides for expeditious attainment of the NAAQS. However, if the BACM
are not adequate to provide for attainment of the standards, then the State must submit additional measures with the
attainment demonstration that will result in attainment of the standard by the statutory deadline or apply for an
extension of the attainment date by demonstrating that the specific conditions of sections 108(e) and 189(b)(1)(A)(ii)
have been met.

The EPA believes this interpretation of the Act is reasonable, even if, as to areas which are classified in the future
as serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas because the areas have failed to attain, the date BACM plans must be submitted
and the date the serious area attainment demonstration is due should happen to coincide. There is no rational basis
for interpreting BACM differently depending merely on when an area happens to be reclassified.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The BACM (including BACT) applicable in a nonattainment area must be determined on a case-by-case basis since the
nature and extent of a nonattainment problem may vary within the area and from one area to another. Nonattainment problems
range from reasonably well-defined areas of violation caused by a specific source or group of sources to violations
over relatively broad geographical areas due predominantly to large numbers of small sources widely-distributed
over the area. The BACM are required for all source categories for which the State cannot conclusively demonstrate
that their impact is de minimis. As stated above, the EPA will generally presume the contribution to nonattainment
of any source category to be de minimis if the source category causes a PM&hyph;10 impact in the area of less than 5 &mu;g/m3
for a 24-hour average and less than 1 &mu;g/m3 annual mean concentration. The starting point for making a BACM determination
would be to reevaluate the emission inventory submitted with the moderate area SIP. Section 172(c)(3) of the Act calls
for all nonattainment areas to submit comprehensive, accurate, and current emissions inventories and provides
for such periodic revisions as may be necessary to assure that the nonattainment planning requirements are met. If
there have been any significant changes in PM&hyph;10 sources in the area since the inventory was first compiled (i.e.,
sources permanently shut down or new or modified sources constructed) or if the inventory is not adequate to support
the more rigorous analysis required for serious area SIP demonstrations, it should be revised. All anthropogenic
sources of PM&hyph;10 emissions and PM&hyph;10 precursors (if applicable)
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 and nonanthropogenic sources in a nonattainment area must be included in the emission inventory.

Ambient filter analysis and inventory information may have been presented in certain moderate area SIP to indicate
the insignificance of secondary particles (see 57 FR 13541&hyph;42).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of its importance in identifying anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic sources and the applicability of BACM
requirements, the breakdown of sources to consider when compiling an emissions inventory are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Major point sources (i.e., sources with the potential to emit at least 70 tons per year of PM&hyph;10 (or PM&hyph;10
precursors) as required in sections 189(b)(3) and 189(e) of the Act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Minor point source categories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Area source categories such as fugitive dust from anthropogenic sources (e.g., construction activities, paved
and unpaved roads, agricultural activities, etc.), residential wood combustion, prescribed burning, and commercial/institutional
fuel combustion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Nonanthropogenic sources.

2. Evaluate Source Category Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second step in determining BACM for an area is to identify those source categories having a greater than de minimis
impact on PM&hyph;10 concentrations. The potential maximum impact of various source categories may have been determined
with receptor or dispersion modeling performed for the attainment demonstration submitted with the moderate area
SIP. In addition, the impact of some source categories may be apparent from analysis of ambient sampling filters from
days when the standards are exceeded. If modeling was not performed during development of the moderate area SIP, receptor
modeling, screening modeling or, preferably, refined dispersion modeling will generally be necessary at this time
to identify key source categories.

In developing a fully adequate BACM SIP, the State is expected to evaluate the technological and economic feasibility

 and other relevant materials for all source categories impacting the nonattainment area except those with a de minimis
impact considering emission reductions achieved with RACM.

Energy and environmental impacts of the control measures and the cost of control should be considered in determining
BACM. In general, for the reasons stated above, the test of economic and technological feasibility will be higher
for source categories in serious areas than for source categories in moderate areas because of the greater need for
emission reductions to attain the NAAQS. As noted earlier, this interpretation is consistent with the overall statutory
scheme which requires that as an area's air quality worsens, increasingly stringent control measures are to be adopted
in conjunction with the area receiving more time to attain the NAAQS. Thus, measures that were not considered reasonable
to implement by the moderate area attainment date may be BACM for serious areas because of the additional time available
for implementing them
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 and because of the higher degree of stringency implied by the statutory scheme and the term ``best.'' Therefore, BACM
could include, though it is not limited to, expanded use of some of the same types of control measures as those included
as RACM in the moderate area SIP.

The statutory attainment date for initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas reclassified as serious will
be December 31, 2001. For areas designated nonattainment subsequent to enactment of the 1990 Amendments that become
serious, the attainment date will be before the end of the tenth year beginning after the area's designation as nonattainment
(see section 188(c)).

It does not currently appear that mobile sources, as distinct from the surfaces on which they travel, contribute significantly
to the PM&hyph;10 air quality problem in a sufficient number of areas to warrant issuing national guidance on best
available transportation control measures for PM&hyph;10 under section 190 of the Act. However, in those areas where
mobile sources do contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 violations, the State must, at a minimum, address the transportation
control measures listed in section 108(f) to determine whether such measures are achievable in the area considering
energy, environmental and economic impacts and other costs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The technological feasibility of reducing emissions from area sources depends on the ability to alter the characteristics
that affect emissions from the sources. Those characteristics have to do with the size or extent of the sources, their
physical characteristics and the operating procedures. Reducing emissions of fugitive dust from construction
activities, for example, could require the most effective combination of reducing the size of the sources (i.e.,
acres cleared at one time or vehicle miles traveled on unpaved surfaces), changing the physical characteristics
(i.e., silt loading on travel surfaces or moisture content of materials handled), and/or changing the operating
practices (i.e., lower vehicle speeds, less surface area exposed to the wind, treating or paving travel surfaces).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technological feasibility of applying an emission reduction method to a particular point source should consider
the source's process and operating procedures, raw materials, physical plant layout, energy requirements, and
any collateral environmental impacts (e.g., water pollution and waste disposal). The process, operating procedures,
and raw materials used by a source can affect the feasibility of implementing process changes that reduce emissions
and the selection of add-on emission control equipment. The operation and longevity of control equipment can be significantly
influenced by the raw materials used and the process to which it is applied. The feasibility of modifying processes
or applying control equipment is also influenced by the physical layout of the particular plant. The space available
in which to implement such changes may limit the choices and will also affect the costs of control.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

4. Evaluate Costs of Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Economic feasibility considers the cost of reducing emissions from a particular source category and costs incurred
by similar sources that have implemented emission reductions. As with RACT determinations and BACT/LAER analyses
in other statutory contexts, EPA believes that for PM&hyph;10 BACM purposes, it is reasonable for similar sources
to bear similar costs of emission reduction. As such, when identifying BACM, consideration of economic feasibility
should not rely on claims regarding the ability of a particular source to ``afford'' to reduce emissions to the level
of similar sources. Otherwise, less efficient sources might be rewarded for their inefficiency by being allowed
to bear lower emission reduction costs. Instead, economic feasibility for PM&hyph;10 BACM purposes should focus
upon evidence that the control technology in question has previously been implemented at other sources in a similar
source category without unreasonable economic impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the economic feasibility of a measure (e.g., road paving) depends on public funding, EPA will consider past
funding of similar activities as well as availability of funding sources to determine whether a good faith effort
is being made to expeditiously implement the available control measures. In other words, if 20 miles of unpaved roads
are typically paved each year, then the BACM fugitive dust program should include paving more than 20 miles per year
of existing roads and should offer evidence of ambitious efforts to increase funding and increase the priority for
use of existing funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The capital costs, annualized costs, and cost effectiveness of an emission reduction technology should be considered
in determining its economic feasibility. The ``OAQPS Control Cost Manual, Fourth Edition,'' EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;90&hyph;006,
January 1990, describes procedures for determining these costs. The above costs should be determined for all technologically-feasible
emission reduction options.

E. Selection of BACM for Area Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once the significant PM&hyph;10 area source categories have been identified, the State should select area source
control measures from the candidate BACM listed in the technical information documents for fugitive dust, residential
wood combustion (RWC), prescribed burning, or any other technical information documents issued by EPA (see footnote
38). This guidance is based on EPA's analysis of available control alternatives for the identified source categories.
While the guidance is intended to be comprehensive, it is by no means exhaustive. Consequently, the State is encouraged
to consider other sources of information and is not precluded from selecting other measures and demonstrating to
the public and EPA that they constitute BACM. Further, any control measure that a commenter indicates during the public
comment period is available for a given area should be reviewed by the planning agency. The agency should determine
whether the affected categories of sources are significant and, if so, whether the available measure is achievable
in the area considering energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated earlier, EPA considers measures that prevent PM&hyph;10 emissions over the long term to be preferable to
short-term curtailment measures. Therefore, when selecting BACM for area sources, a State should first consider
pollution preventive measures and measures that provide for long-term sustained progress toward attainment in
preference to quick, temporary control. For example, a State should consider requiring the replacement, over time,
of old wood stoves with cleaner-burning wood stoves or alternative fuels. Such programs would complement and reduce
dependance on wood-burning curtailment programs adopted as RACM for the moderate area SIP. However, EPA recognizes
that such long-term measures may entail significant lead time and that temporary measures like wood-burning curtailments
may need to be continued in serious areas, at a minimum, to provide interim health protection.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once the list of available measures for an area source has been identified, the State must evaluate the technological
and economic feasibility of implementing the controls. The State may refer to the technical information documents
for procedures to determine feasibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When evaluating economic feasibility, States should not restrict their analysis to simple acceptance/rejection
decisions based on whether full application of a measure to all sources in a particular category is feasible. Rather,
a State should consider implementing a control measure on a more limited basis, e.g., for a percentage of the sources
in a category if it is determined that 100 percent implementation of the measure is infeasible. This would mean, for
example, that an area should consider the feasibility of paving 75 percent of the unpaved roadways even though paving
all of the roads may be infeasible. Alternatively, the State should consider whether measures which cannot feasibly
be implemented in their entirety prior to the statutory deadline for BACM implementation could be completed over
an extended period. In that event, BACM might itself be defined to change over time from a more limited set of measures
at the initial implementation date to a progressively tighter or more ambitious program at later dates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following example is presented to illustrate how a moderate area program of RACM for fugitive dust control may
be complemented with additional BACM after the area is reclassified as serious. Assume that the following control
measures were adopted as RACM: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Reduce the speed limit on unpaved county roads to 25 miles per hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Treat all unpaved county roads, monthly, with chemical dust suppressants within 500 feet of their intersections
with paved roads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Treat 10 miles of the most heavily-traveled, unpaved county roads with chemical dust suppressants once per month.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Pave 4 miles of unpaved city streets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Treat unpaved parking lots in the city with chemical dust suppressants once per month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Clean anti-skid materials from 50 miles of city streets within 48 hours after snow melt begins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same area, after being reclassified as serious, may adopt the following BACM examples to complement the RACM program:

In summary, the State must document its selection of BACM by showing what control measures applicable to each source
category (not shown to be de minimis) were considered. The control measures selected should preferably be measures
that will prevent PM&hyph;10 emissions rather than temporarily reduce them. The documentation should compare the
control efficiency of technologically-feasible measures, their energy and environmental impacts and the costs
of implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Selection of BACT for Point Sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reviewing authority determines BACT on a case-by-case basis. As described above, EPA would expect the reviewing
authority to select an emissions limitation that reflects the maximum degree of emission reduction of each pollutant
subject to regulation (PM&hyph;10 and/or PM&hyph;10 precursors), taking into account energy, environmental,
and economic impacts and other costs, that it determines is achievable for such facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of preceding discussions of BACT and its statutory bases, it is EPA's policy that BACT be determined using
the analytical methodology established in the reviewing authority's current PSD program to the extent that it is
consistent with guidance contained in this notice. The analytical methodology used should, at a minimum, consider
a representative range of available controls (including the most stringent, those capable of meeting standards
of performance under 40 CFR part 60 or 61, and those identified by commenters during the public comment period). Selection
of a particular control system as BACT must be justified by a comparison of the candidate control systems considering
energy, environmental, and economic impacts, and other costs, and be supported by the record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, if the reviewing authority determines that there is no economically-reasonable or technologically-feasible
way to accurately measure the emissions, and hence to impose an enforceable emissions standard, it may require the
source to use design, alternative equipment, work practice, or operational standards to reduce emissions of the
pollutant to the maximum extent feasible (see, by analogy, 40 CFR 52.21(b)(12); 40 CFR 51.166(b)(12)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative approaches to reducing emissions of particulate matter including PM&hyph;10 are discussed in ``Control
Techniques for Particulate Emissions From Stationary Sources'' - Volume I (EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;81/005a) and
Volume II (EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;81&hyph;005b), September 1982. The design, operation, and maintenance of general
particulate matter control systems such as mechanical collectors, electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters,
and wet scrubbers are discussed in Volume I. The collection efficiency of each system is discussed as a function of
particle size. Information is also presented regarding energy and environmental considerations and procedures
for estimating costs of particulate matter control equipment. The emission characteristics and control technologies
applicable to specific source categories are discussed in Volume II. Secondary environmental impacts are also discussed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BACT/LAER Clearinghouse, the EPA Control Technology Center, and past BACT analyses for new and modified major
sources under the PSD program may be used to assist in identifying available control options and maximum achievable
emission reductions. The EPA will continue to evaluate the need for additional guidance and will produce additional
materials as appropriate.

VII. Contingency Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 172(c)(9) requires that SIP's provide for the implementation of specific measures to be undertaken if the
Administrator finds that the nonattainment area has failed to make RFP toward attainment or to attain the primary
NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. Following the Administrator's finding, the measures are to ``take effect
without further action by the State, or the Administrator.'' The EPA interprets this requirement to be that no further
rulemaking actions by the State or EPA would be needed to implement the contingency measures (see generally 57 FR 13512
and 13543&hyph;544). The EPA recognizes that certain actions, such as the notification of sources, modification
of permits, etc., would probably be needed before a measure could be implemented effectively. However, States must
show that their contingency measures can be implemented with minimal further action on their part and with no additional
rulemaking actions such as public hearings or legislative review. After EPA determines that a moderate PM&hyph;10
nonattainment area has failed to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, EPA generally expects all actions needed to effect
full implementation of the measures to occur within 60 days after EPA notifies the State of the area's failure. The
State should ensure that the measures are fully implemented as expeditiously as practicable after they take effect.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of contingency measures is to ensure that additional measures beyond or in addition to the required ``core''
control measures (i.e. RACM for moderate areas and BACM for serious areas) immediately take effect when the area fails
to make RFP or to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in order to provide interim public health and welfare protection. The
protection is considered ``interim'' because the statute often provides for a more formal SIP revision in order to
correct, for example, the failure of an area to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS (e.g., section 189(b)_serious area plan
required upon finding of failure of moderate area to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS under 188(b)(2)_and 189(d) (plan
revisions required upon failure of serious area to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS)). Thus, EPA has noted previously
that contingency measures should consist of other available control measures not contained in the applicable core
control strategy (57 FR 13543). In designing its contingency measures, the State should also take into consideration
the potential nature and extent of any attainment shortfall for the area. The magnitude of the effectiveness of the
measures should be calculated to achieve the appropriate percentage of the actual emission reductions required
by the SIP control strategy to bring about attainment. The EPA has recommended that contingency measures provide
the emission reductions equivalent to 1 year's average increment of RFP (see discussion below).

Once moderate areas are subsequently reclassified as serious, the affected States must ensure that adequate contingency
measures, as described above, are in place for such areas. This is explicitly required under the statute. Section
189(b)(1) requires areas reclassified as serious to submit ``an implementation plan.'' Under section 172(c), in
turn, ``plan provisions'' required under part D must provide for the implementation of contingency measures. Accordingly,
for those moderate areas reclassified as serious, if all or part of the moderate area plan contingency measures become
part of the required serious area control measures (i.e., BACM), then additional contingency measures must be submitted
whether or not the previously submitted contingency measures had already been implemented. Further, the affected
States must ensure that serious areas have adequate contingency measures considering, among other things, new information
about the potential attainment shortfall for the newly reclassified serious area. The States must submit contingency
measures for serious areas or otherwise demonstrate that adequate measures are in place within 3 years of reclassification.

The Clean Air Act does not prescribe when States containing serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas shall submit
section 172(c)(9) contingency measures (or otherwise demonstrate that adequate contingency measures are already
in place). However, section 172(b) of the Act directs the Administrator to establish a schedule for submittal of the
plan items in section 172(c) at the time the Administrator designates an area as nonattainment. Such schedule is to
include a date or dates ``extending no later than 3 years from the date of the nonattainment designation'' (see section
172(b)). By analogy, EPA concludes it is reasonable to establish that the formal deadline for the submittal of section
172(c)(9) contingency measures (or a demonstration that adequate contingency measures are in place) by States containing
serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas is no later than 3 years from the date of the serious area reclassification

A. General Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area SIP's must include quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years
until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP toward attainment by the applicable date (see
section 189(c) of the amended Act). Section 171(1) of the Act defines RFP as ``such annual incremental reductions
in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by this part (part D) or may reasonably be required by the
Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable national ambient air quality standard by
the applicable date.'' A discussion of these requirements follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Reasonable Further Progress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Historically, for some pollutants, RFP has been met by showing annual incremental emission reductions sufficient
generally to maintain at least linear progress toward attainment by the specified deadline. Requiring linear progress
reductions in emissions to maintain RFP may be appropriate in four situations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. When pollutants are emitted by numerous and diverse sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Where the relationship between any individual source and the overall air quality is not explicitly quantified.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Where a chemical transformation is involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Where the emission reductions necessary to attain the standard are inventory-wide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in those areas where the nonattainment problem is attributed to area type sources (e.g., fugitive dust,
residential wood combustion, etc.), RFP should be met by showing annual incremental emission reductions sufficient
generally to maintain linear progress towards attainment. Total PM&hyph;10 emissions should not remain constant
or increase from 1 year to the next in such an area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring linear progress reductions in emissions to maintain RFP is less appropriate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Where there are a limited number of sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Where the relationships between individual sources and air quality are relatively well defined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Where the emission control systems utilized (e.g., at major point sources) will result in swift and dramatic emission
reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in those areas where the PM&hyph;10 nonattainment problem is attributed to a few stationary sources,
RFP should be met by ``adherence to an ambitious compliance schedule''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
42
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which is likely to periodically yield significant emission reductions. Adherence to ``an ambitious compliance
schedule'' does not necessarily mean that it would be unreasonable to achieve annual incremental emission reductions
or generally linear progress, however.

The SIP's for PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must include detailed schedules for compliance with emission regulations
in the areas and accurately indicate the corresponding annual emission reductions to be realized from each milestone
in the schedule. In reviewing the SIP, EPA will determine whether the annual incremental emission reductions to be
achieved are reasonable in light of the statutory objective to ensure timely attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS.
Additionally, EPA believes that it is appropriate to require early implementation of the most cost-effective control
measures (e.g., controlling fugitive dust emissions at the stationary source) while phasing in the more expensive
control measures, such as those involving the installation of new hardware. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 189(c) provides that the quantitative milestones submitted by a State for an area also must be consistent
with RFP for the area. Thus, EPA will determine an area's compliance with RFP in conjunction with determining its compliance
with the quantitative milestone requirement. Because RFP is an annual emission reduction requirement and the quantitative
milestones are to be achieved every 3 years, when a State demonstrates an area's compliance with the quantitative
milestone requirement, it should also demonstrate that RFP has been achieved during each of the relevant 3 years.
Thus, the discussion of quantitative milestones below refers to the ``RFP/milestone'' submittal dates, achievement
dates and demonstration (or reporting) requirements.

1. Nature of Quantitative Milestones 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned above, PM&hyph;10 nonattainment SIP's are to contain quantitative milestones (see section 189(c)).
These quantitative milestones should consist of elements which allow progress to be quantified or measured. Specifically,
States should identify and submit quantitative milestones providing for the amount of emission reductions adequate
to achieve the NAAQS by the applicable attainment date. The following are examples of measures which support and demonstrate
how the overall quantitative milestones identified for an area may be met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Percent implementation of various control strategies (e.g., pave 50 percent of culpable streets, replace 75 percent
of residential wood heaters with natural gas heating units). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Percent compliance with implemented control measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Adherence to a compliance schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. RFP/Milestone Due Dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned above, PM&hyph;10 nonattainment SIP's are to contain quantitative milestones which are to be achieved
every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment. There is a gap in the law in that the text of section 189(c) does
not articulate the starting point for counting the 3-year period. The EPA believes it is reasonable to begin counting
the 3-year milestone deadline from the due date (and not the submittal date) for the applicable moderate area implementation
plan revision (see section III.C.1.(f) of the General Preamble (57 FR 13539) for an explanation of why EPA believes
it is appropriate to begin counting the 3-year milestone deadline from the SIP due date). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first ``RFP/milestone'' achievement date for those areas initially designated as nonattainment for PM&hyph;10
by operation of law when the Act was amended will be the moderate area attainment date of December 31, 1994, as stated
in section III.C.1.f. of the General Preamble (57 FR 13539). The RFP/milestone achievement date would normally be
November 15, 1994, 3 years after the SIP due date of November 15, 1991. The achievement date was delayed 46 days, however,
because the de minimis timing differential between the attainment date and the literal first milestone date made
it administratively impracticable and of trivial value to require separate milestones and attainment demonstrations
for these areas. Thus, for these initial areas that demonstrate timely attainment, EPA's policy is to deem the emission
reductions progress made between the SIP submittal due date and the attainment date as sufficient to satisfy the first
milestone requirement (57 FR 13539). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus the initial RFP/milestone will be met by showing that emission reductions scheduled to be made between the SIP
due date and the attainment date for these moderate areas were actually achieved. Most of the emission reductions
will result from implementation of RACM (including RACT) adopted as part of the moderate area SIP. The Act requires
that RACM be implemented by December 10, 1993 in the initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (see section 189(a)).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequent RFP/milestones for these initial PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas that are reclassified as serious will
be due every 3 years after the original due date for the moderate area SIP.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
43
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, the second RFP/milestone for the initial nonattainment areas that are reclassified as serious must be
achieved by November 15, 1997. The third RFP/milestone achievement date will be November 15, 2000, etc. These RFP/milestones
should be addressed by quantifying and comparing the annual incremental emission reductions which result from implementation
of BACM/BACT (required within 4 years after the area is reclassified as serious) and from additional measures included
in the final serious area SIP to those reductions which were identified in the SIP as quantitative milestones necessary
to achieve the NAAQS by the applicable attainment date. The annual incremental emission reductions must be sufficient
to assure attainment as expeditiously as practicable but not later than December 31, 2001. In some cases it may also
be appropriate to require that the annual incremental emission reductions maintain at least linear progress toward
attainment, as discussed earlier.

The plain terms of section 189(c) require that milestones be achieved ``every 3 years until the area is redesignated
attainment'' and, therefore, do not contemplate any breaks in the milestones due to an area's reclassification.
Further, reclassifying an area to serious does not obviate the State from controls and emission reductions required
in the moderate area implementation plan (see section 189(b)(1)). A continuous series of control measures must be
implemented in PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas beginning with RACM (including RACT) and followed by contingency
measures which are to be implemented if the moderate area fails to attain. Next, BACM (including BACT) must be implemented
within 4 years after the area is reclassified as serious. Subsequently, it may be necessary to implement additional
control measures beyond BACM/BACT to attain the NAAQS. Therefore, the structure of the Act requires a series of measures
which can provide for RFP/milestones.

3. RFP/Milestone Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State must demonstrate to EPA, within 90 days after the milestone achievement date, that the SIP measures are being
implemented and the RFP/quantitative milestones have been met (see section 189(c)(2)). The RFP/milestone report
must be submitted from the Governor or Governor's designee to the Regional Administrator of the respective EPA Regional
Office which serves the State where the affected area is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RFP/milestone report must contain technical support sufficient to document completion statistics for appropriate
milestones. For example, the demonstration should graphically display RFP over the course of the relevant 3 years
and indicate how the emission reductions achieved to date compare to those required or scheduled to meet RFP and the
required milestones. The calculations (and any assumptions made) necessary to determine the emission reductions
to date should also be submitted. The demonstration should also contain an evaluation of whether the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS
will be attained by the projected attainment date in the SIP, i.e., answer the question ``Are the emission reductions
to date sufficient to ensure timely attainment?'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within 90 days of its receipt, EPA must determine whether or not the State's demonstration is adequate and meets all
the requirements discussed above. The EPA will notify the State of its determination by sending a letter to the appropriate
Governor or Governor's designee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Failure to Submit RFP/Milestone Report or Meet RFP/Milestones 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a State fails to submit the RFP/milestone report within the required timeframes or if EPA determines that the State
has not met any applicable RFP/milestone, EPA shall require the State, within 9 months after such failure or determination,
to submit a plan revision that assures that the State will achieve the next milestone (or attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS,
if there is no next milestone) by the applicable date (see section 189(c)(3)). For example, with respect to RFP, if
the required annual emission reductions are not achieved for the relevant years according to the RFP schedule and
the implementing milestone requirement, EPA will require the State to submit a SIP revision so that these deviations
can be corrected and attainment assured by the applicable date. This would also necessitate implementation of appropriate
contingency measures pursuant to section 172(c)(9).

Note also that failure to meet RFP, if not expeditiously corrected, could also result in the application of sanctions
as described in sections 110(m) and 179(b) of the amended Act (pursuant to a finding under section 179(a)(4)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (E.O. 12866) (58 FR 51,735 (October 4, 1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements
of E.O. 12866. The E.O. 12866 defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that
may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal
government or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of E.O. 12866, OMB has notified EPA that this action is a ``significant regulatory action'' within
the meaning of the Executive Order. For this reason, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response
to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record.

Whenever the Agency is required by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) or any other law to publish
general notice of proposed rulemaking for any proposed rule, the Agency shall propose and make available for public
comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis. The regulatory flexibility requirements do not apply for this
PM&hyph;10 serious area addendum to the General Preamble because it is not a regulatory action in the context of the
APA or the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the April 7, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 16762), the Service requested proposals from Indian tribes that wished to establish special migratory bird
hunting regulations for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season, under the guidelines described in the June 4, 1985 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (50 FR 23467). The guidelines were developed in response to tribal requests for Service recognition of their reserved
hunting rights, and for some tribes, recognition of their authority to regulate hunting by both tribal and non-tribal
members on their reservations. The guidelines include possibilities for: (1) on-reservation hunting by both tribal
and nontribal members, with hunting by nontribal members on some reservations to take place within Federal frameworks
but on dates different from those selected by the surrounding State(s); (2) on-reservation hunting by tribal members
only, outside of usual Federal frameworks for season dates and length, and for daily bag and possession limits; and
(3) off-reservation hunting by tribal members on ceded lands, outside of usual framework dates and season length,
with some added flexibility in daily bag and possession limits. In all cases, the regulations established under the
guidelines would have to be consistent with the March 10 to September 1 closed season mandated by the 1916 Migratory
Bird Treaty with Canada. The guidelines are capable of application to those tribes that have recognized reserved
hunting rights on Federal Indian reservations (including off-reservation trust lands) and on ceded lands. They
also apply to establishing migratory bird hunting regulations for nontribal members on all lands within the exterior
boundaries of reservations where tribes have full wildlife management authority over such hunting or where the tribes
and affected States otherwise have reached agreement over hunting by nontribal members on lands owned by non-Indians
within the reservation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tribes usually have the authority to regulate migratory bird hunting by nonmembers on Indian-owned reservation
lands, subject to Service approval. The question of jurisdiction is more complex on reservations that include lands
owned by non-Indians, especially when the surrounding States have established or intend to establish regulations
governing hunting by non-Indians on these lands. In such cases, the Service encourages the tribes and States to reach
agreement on regulations that would apply throughout the reservations. When appropriate, the Service will consult
with a tribe and State with the aim of facilitating an accord. The Service also will consult jointly with tribal and
State officials in the affected States where tribes may wish to establish special hunting regulations for tribal
members on ceded lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of past questions regarding interpretation of what events trigger the consultation process, as well as who
initiates it, there is a need to provide clarification here. The Service routinely provides 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 copies of published proposed and final rulemakings and other documents to all State Directors, tribes and other interested
parties. It is the responsibility of the States, tribes and others to bring any concern for any feature(s) of any regulations
to the attention of the Service. Consultation will be initiated at the point in time at which the Service is made aware
of a concern. The Service cannot presume to know beforehand what, if any, concerns will be voiced regarding rulemakings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidelines provide for the continuation of harvest of waterfowl and other migratory game birds by tribal members
on reservations where it has been a customary practice. The Service does not oppose this harvest, provided it does
not take place during the closed season defined by the 1916 Migratory Bird Convention with Canada, and it is not so large
as to adversely affect the status of the migratory bird resource.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before developing the guidelines, the Service reviewed available information on the current status of migratory
bird populations and the current status of migratory bird hunting on Federal Indian reservations and evaluated the
impact that adoption of the guidelines likely would have on migratory birds. The Service has concluded that the size
of the migratory bird harvest by tribal members hunting on their reservations is normally too small to have significant
impacts on the migratory bird resource. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One area of interest in Indian migratory bird hunting regulations relates to hunting seasons for nontribal members
on dates that are within Federal frameworks, but that are different from those established by the State(s) in which
a Federal Indian reservation is located. A large influx of nontribal hunters onto a reservation at a time when the season
is closed in the surrounding State(s) could result in adverse population impacts on one or more migratory bird species.
The guidelines make such an event unlikely, however, because tribal proposals must include: (a) details on the harvest
anticipated under the requested regulations; (b) methods that will be employed to measure or monitor harvest (bag
checks, mail questionnaires, etc.); (c) steps that will be taken to limit level of harvest, where it could be shown
that failure to limit such harvest would impact on the migratory bird resource; and (d) tribal capabilities to establish
and enforce migratory bird hunting regulations. Based on a review of tribal proposals, the Service may require modifications,
and regulations may be established experimentally, pending evaluation and confirmation of harvest information
obtained by the tribes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service believes that the guidelines provide appropriate opportunity to accommodate the reserved hunting rights
and management authority of Indian tribes while ensuring that the migratory bird resource receives necessary protection.
The conservation of this important international resource is paramount. The guidelines should not be viewed as inflexible.
In this regard, the Service notes that they have been employed successfully since 1985 to establish special hunting
regulations for Indian tribes. Therefore, the Service believes they have been tested adequately and they were made
final beginning with the 1988&hyph;89 hunting season (53 FR 31612). It should be stressed here, however, that use
of the guidelines is not mandatory and no action is required if a tribe wishes to observe the hunting regulations established
by the State(s) in which the reservation is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been appropriate over the past several years to make a statement in this proposed rule qualifying the Service's
intent with regard to approving duck seasons and limits because of the uncertainty of production. Although the Service
notes that survey results in the 1993&hyph;94 season indicated duck numbers were not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
significantly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 changed from those of the previous few years, there is reason for cautious optimism that the trend of poor reproduction
caused by a long period of drought in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada and the United States may be in the early stages
of reversal. Certainly there are indications that drought conditions are lessening, which may in turn set the stage
for improved duck production. The extended drought has been especially severe in critical production areas, but
in 1993&hyph;94 water conditions in many important local production areas were good. Although 1994 spring and early-summer
ground water conditions appear to have improved greatly in most areas of the Prairie Pothole Region, preliminary
results of breeding population surveys and production will not be known for some time. Thus, although the situation
is expected to be improved, the Service will continue to assess production information as it becomes available over
the summer and make final decisions on 1994&hyph;95 regulatory frameworks when all the customary data are in.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the purpose of this document is to propose 1994&hyph;95 season migratory bird hunting regulations for
participating tribes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season, the Service received requests from fifteen tribes and Indian organizations
that followed the 1985 proposal guidelines and were appropriate for publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 without further and/or alternative actions. The Lower Brule Sioux (South Dakota), the Kalispel Tribe (Washington)
and the Klamath Tribe (Oregon) are included in the regulations this year for the first time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 17, the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians (Minnesota) provided the Service with a proposal to continue with
regulations for the upcoming season as per the Memorandum of Understanding between the Service and the band with regard
to migratory bird hunting on the reservation. (The Mille Lacs Band is currently litigating off-reservation hunting
and fishing rights with the State of Minnesota.) The Service and the Mille Lacs Band have cooperated in this fashion
since the 1986&hyph;87 migratory bird hunting season. Similar agreements have been reached with other tribes in
other hunting seasons. The Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin has indicated to the Service that they will seek such
an agreement in the future.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service actively solicits regulatory proposals from other tribal groups that have an interest in working cooperatively
for the benefit of waterfowl and other migratory game birds. Also, tribes are encouraged to work with the Service in
developing agreements for management of migratory bird resources on tribal lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that this proposed rule includes generalized regulations for both early and late season hunting.
There will be a final rule published later in an August 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that will include tribal regulations for the early hunting season. The early season begins on September 1 each year
and most commonly includes such species as mourning doves and white-winged doves. There will also be a final rule published
in a September 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that will include regulations for late season hunting. The late season begins on or around October 1 and most commonly
includes waterfowl species. In this current rulemaking, because of the compressed timeframe for establishing regulations
for Indian tribes and because final frameworks dates and other specific information are not available, the regulations
for many tribal hunting seasons are described in relation to the season dates, season length and limits that will be
permitted when final Federal frameworks are announced for early and late season regulations. For example, the daily
bag and possession limits for ducks on some areas are shown as ``Same as permitted Pacific Flyway States under final
Federal frameworks,'' and limits for geese will be shown as the same that will be permitted the State(s) in which the
tribal hunting area is located. The proposed frameworks for early-season regulations will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in mid-July; early-season final frameworks will be published in mid-August. Proposed late-season frameworks for
waterfowl and coots will be published in mid-August, and the final frameworks for the late seasons will be published
in mid-September. The Service will notify affected tribes of season dates, bag limits, etc., as soon as final frameworks
are established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed earlier in this document, no action is required by tribes that wish to observe the migratory bird hunting
regulations established by the State in which a reservation is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations for the fifteen tribes with proposals that meet the established criteria are shown below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, Jicarilla Indian Reservation, Dulce, New Mexico 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Jicarilla Apache Tribe has had special migratory bird hunting regulations for tribal members and nonmembers
since the 1986&hyph;87 hunting season. The tribe owns all lands on the reservation and has recognized full wildlife
management authority. The proposed seasons and bag limits would be more conservative than allowed by the Federal
frameworks of last season and more conservative than States in the Pacific Flyway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a May 2, 1994, proposal, the tribe proposed the earliest opening date permitted Pacific Flyway States for ducks
for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season and a closing date of November 30, 1994. Daily bag and possession limits also would
be the same as permitted Pacific Flyway States. However, it is proposed again that no canvasbacks be allowed in the
bag. Also, the goose season would continue to be closed. Other regulations specific to the Pacific Flyway guidelines
for New Mexico would be in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Jicarilla Game and Fish Department gives an annual estimate of harvest, which continues to be relatively small_comparatively
speaking. In the 1993&hyph;94 season, estimated duck harvest was 1323, the largest since recordkeeping began in
1986, with the greatest percentage of this made up of mallards (31 percent), gadwall (27 percent) and teal (16 percent).
Because water conditions on the reservation are again excellent, another good duck production and harvest year is
expected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requested regulations are essentially the same as were established last year, and the Service proposes to approve
the tribe's request for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. White Mountain Apache Tribe, Fort Apache Indian Reservation, Whiteriver, Arizona 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The White Mountain Apache Tribe owns all reservation lands, and the tribe has recognized full wildlife management
authority. The White Mountain Apache Tribe has requested regulations that are essentially unchanged from those
agreed to for the 1993&hyph;94 hunting year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hunting zone for waterfowl continues to be restricted and is described as: the entire length of the Black and Salt
Rivers forming the southern boundary of the reservation; the White River, extending from the Canyon Day Stockman
Station to the Salt River; and all stock ponds located within Wildlife Management Units 4, 6 and 7. All other waters
of the reservation would be closed to waterfowl hunting for the 1994&hyph;95 season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tribe is proposing a continuous duck, coot, merganser, gallinule and moorhen hunting season, with an opening
date of November 12, 1994, and a closing date of January 8, 1995. The tribe proposes a daily duck bag limit of 3, which
can have no more than: 1 redhead; 2 canvasbacks; 1 pintail; and 1 hen mallard. The daily bag limit for mergansers is 3.
The daily bag limit for coots, gallinules and moorhens would be 25 singly, or in the aggregate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For geese, the season is proposed to extend from November 12, 1994, through January 8, 1995. Hunting would be limited
to Canada geese, and the daily bag limit is 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Season dates for band-tailed pigeons and mourning doves would run concurrently from September 2 through September
11, 1994, in Wildlife Management Units 7 and 10, only. Proposed daily bag limits for band-tailed pigeons and mourning
doves would be 3 and 8, respectively.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Possession limits for the above referenced species are twice the daily bag limits. Shooting hours would be from one-half
hour before sunrise to sunset. There would be no open season for sandhill cranes, rails and snipe on the White Mountain
Apache lands under this proposal. A number of special regulations apply to tribal and non-tribal hunters, which may
be obtained from the White Mountain Apache Tribe Game and Fish Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations requested by the tribe for the 1994&hyph;95 seasons are as conservative as those established last
year, and the Service proposes to approve them.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Colorado River Indian Reservation is located in Arizona and California. The tribes own almost all lands on the
reservation, and they have full wildlife management authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their 1994&hyph;95 proposal, dated May 17, 1994, the Colorado River Indian Tribes are requesting split dove seasons
with regulations as follows. The early season is proposed to begin on September 1 and end on September 11, 1994, with
the bag limits being ten (10) mourning or ten (10) white wing doves either singly or in the aggregate. The late season
for doves is proposed to open on November 21, 1994, and close on January 8, 1995, with the bag limit being ten (10) mourning
doves. The possession limit would be twice the daily bag limit. Shooting hours would be from one-half hour before sunrise
to sunset, and other special tribally set regulations would apply.

The Colorado River Indian Tribes are also proposing split duck hunting seasons, the first running from October 14,
1994, through November 10, 1994, and the second running from December 9, 1994, through January 8, 1995. The Tribes
are proposing the same dates for coots and common moorhens. The daily bag limit for ducks, including mergansers, would
be 4, which would include no more than 2 redheads, 2 pintails, 1 canvasback or 1 Mexican duck. The possession limit would
be twice the daily bag limit, after the first day. The daily bag limit for coots and common moorhens would be 25, singly
or in the aggregate. The possession limit for coots and common moorhens would be twice the daily bag limit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For geese, the Colorado River Indian Tribes has proposed a season of October 22, 1994, through January 22, 1995. The
daily bag and possession limits for geese would be 5, which would include no more than 3 white geese (snow and/or Ross
and blue geese) and not more than 2 dark geese (Canada geese). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulations described here, based upon past seasons, the anticipated harvest is estimated to
be less than 400 ducks and 100 geese. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A valid Colorado River Indian Reservation hunting permit is required before taking wildlife and to be in possession
while hunting. As in the past, the regulations would apply both to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribal and non-tribal hunters. The Service is proposing to approve the Colorado River Indian Tribes regulations.

Since 1985, various bands of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians have exercised judicially recognized off-reservation
hunting rights for migratory birds in Wisconsin. The specific regulations were established by the Service in consultation
with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC,
which represents the various bands). Beginning in 1986, a tribal season on ceded lands in the western portion of the
State's Upper Peninsula was developed in coordination with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, and the
Service has approved special regulations for tribal members in both Michigan and Wisconsin since the 1986&hyph;87,
hunting season. In 1987, the GLIFWC requested and the Service approved special regulations to permit tribal members
to hunt on ceded lands in Minnesota, as well as in Michigan and Wisconsin. The States of Michigan and Wisconsin concurred
with the regulations, although Wisconsin has raised some concerns each year. Minnesota did not concur with the regulations,
stressing that the State would not recognize Chippewa Indian hunting rights in Minnesota's treaty area until a court
with jurisdiction over the State acknowledges and defines the extent of these rights. The Service acknowledged the
State's concern, but pointed out that the United States Government has recognized the Indian hunting rights decided
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 case, and that acceptable hunting regulations have been negotiated successfully in both Michigan and Wisconsin
even though the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Voigt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision did not specifically address ceded land outside Wisconsin. The Service believes this is appropriate because
the treaties in question cover ceded lands in Michigan (and Minnesota), as well as in Wisconsin. Consequently, in
view of the above, the Service has approved special regulations since the 1987&hyph;88 hunting season on ceded lands
in all three States. In fact, this recognition of the principle of reserved treaty rights for band members to hunt and
fish was pivotal in a decision by the Service to approve a special season for the 1836 ceded area in Michigan for the 1991&hyph;92
migratory bird hunting seasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recently, certain GLIFWC member bands have brought suit to resolve the issue of hunting, fishing and gathering rights
in the Minnesota ceded areas covered under the 1837 and 1854 treaties. The Federal Government has intervened in support
of the bands.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a June 3, 1994, letter, the GLIFWC proposed off-reservation special migratory bird hunting regulations for the
1994&hyph;95 seasons. Details of the proposed regulations are shown below. In general, the proposal contains liberalizations
in bag limits for ducks (including mergansers) and geese from 1993&hyph;94 for all of the Minnesota and Wisconsin
ceded areas. Bag limits for ducks and geese in these areas would be 20 and 10, respectively, although certain sex and
species restrictions would apply. Regulations proposed for the 1836 and 1842 Treaty areas located in Michigan will
be the same as those permitted for the State of Michigan, except for the daily bag limit of geese. Last year, the request
for increase of goose bag limits was objected to by the Service in the belief that the Southern James Bay Population
of Canada Geese, a population that has declined dramatically in the past several years, could potentially be further
hurt by this action. We now know that this goose population is not a major contributor to the GLIFWC member band harvest;
probably less than 25 geese from this population are taken annually by the Bay Mills Community hunters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has met several times over the last three months with the GLIFWC to explore the increase in duck and goose
bag limit issue. The 1994&hyph;95 GLIFWC proposal provided results from those meetings and reflects the sensitivity
to biological concerns acknowledged both by the GLIFWC and the Service. Estimates indicate that the GLIFWC bands
have been harvesting less than 2000 ducks and 600 geese annually in past years. Results of the 1993&hyph;94 hunter
survey show that 1631 ducks and 402 geese were actually harvested. Under the proposed regulations, the increase in
harvest is projected to not exceed 3000 ducks and 900 geese. The Service believes that regulations advanced by the
GLIFWC for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season are biologically acceptable. The Service is proposing to approve the
GLIFWC regulations. If the regulations are finalized as proposed, the Service would request that the GLIFWC closely
monitor the member band duck harvest and take any actions necessary to reduce harvest if locally nesting populations
are being significantly impacted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission and the Service are parties to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) designed to facilitate the ongoing enforcement
of Service-approved tribal migratory bird regulations. The MOA is intended to have long-term cooperative application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, as in recent seasons, the proposal contains references to Chapter 10 of the Migratory Bird Harvesting Regulations
of the Model Off-Reservation Conservation Code. Chapter 10 regulations parallel State and Federal regulations
and, in effect, are not changed by this change in reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. While hunting waterfowl, a tribal member must carry on his/her person a valid tribal waterfowl hunting permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Except as otherwise noted, tribal members will be required to comply with tribal codes that will be no less restrictive
than the provisions of Chapter 10 of the Model Off-Reservation Code. Except as modified by the Service rules adopted
in response to this proposal, these amended regulations parallel Federal requirements, 50 CFR Part 20 and shooting
hour regulations in 50 CFR Part 20, Subpart K, as to hunting methods, transportation, sale, exportation and other
conditions generally applicable to migratory bird hunting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Tribal members in each zone will comply with State regulations providing for closed and restricted waterfowl hunting
areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Possession limits for each species are double the daily bag limit, except on the opening day of the season, when the
possession limit equals the daily bag limit, unless otherwise noted above. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Possession limits are applicable only to transportation and do not include birds which are cleaned, dressed, and
at a member's primary residence. For purposes of enforcing bag and possession limits, all migratory birds in the possession
or custody of tribal members on ceded lands will be considered to have been taken on those lands unless tagged by a tribal
or State conservation warden as having been taken on-reservation. In Wisconsin, such tagging will comply with applicable
State laws. All migratory birds which fall on reservation lands will not count as part of any off-reservation bag or
possession limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Minnesota and Michigan_Duck Blinds and Decoys. Tribal members hunting in Michigan and Minnesota will comply with
tribal codes that contain provisions that parallel applicable State laws concerning duck blinds and/or decoys.

acres. All Reservation land is owned by the tribe and it has full management authority. Currently, the tribe has no
recognized rights to hunt, fish or gather off-reservation. The Kalispel Tribe has a fully developed wildlife program
with hunting and fishing codes. The tribe enjoys excellent wildlife management relations with the State of Washington,
with which it has an operational Memorandum of Understanding with emphasis on fisheries but also for wildlife. The
seasons described below pertain to non-tribal hunters that would be allowed to harvest waterfowl on a 176 acre waterfowl
management unit. The tribe is utilizing this opportunity to rehabilitate an area that needs protection because of
past land use practices, as well as to provide additional waterfowl hunting in the area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the 1994&hyph;95 migratory bird hunting seasons, the Kalispel Tribe is proposing duck and goose seasons that
begin 2 weeks earlier and end 2 weeks later than those for the State of Washington in the same area. The outside framework
for ducks and geese would run from October 1, 1994, through January 29, 1995. In that period, non-tribal hunters would
be allowed to hunt on Wednesdays, weekends, holidays and for a continuous period from November 28 through December
31; the total being 77 days. Hunters should obtain further information on days from the Kalispel Tribe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Daily bag and possession limits would be the same as those for the State of Washington. All other State and Federal regulations
contained in 50 CFR Part 20, such as use of steel shot and possession of a signed migratory bird hunting stamp, will be
observed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service proposes to agree to the regulations requested by the Kalispel Tribe.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Klamath Tribe currently has no reservation, per se. However, the Klamath Tribe has reserved hunting, fishing
and gathering rights within the former reservation boundary. This area of former reservation, granted to the Klamaths
by the Treaty of 1864, is over 1 million acres. Tribal natural resource management authority is derived from the Treaty
of 1864, and carried out cooperatively under the judicially enforced Consent Decree of 1981. The parties to this Consent
Decree are the Federal Government, the State of Oregon and the Klamaths. The Klamath Indian Game Commission conducts
the setting of seasons. Tribal harvest is monitored by both the tribal biological staff and tribal Regulatory Enforcement
Officers through frequent bag checks and hunter interviews.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a May 6, 1994, letter, the Klamath Tribe proposed season dates that run from October 1, 1994, through January 28,
1995. Daily bag limits would be 9 for ducks and 6 for geese; the possession limits would be twice the daily bag limit.
The daily bag and possession limit for coots would be 25. Shooting hours would be one-half hour before sunrise to one-half
hour after sunset.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service proposes to approve the regulations of the Klamath Tribe, provided an agreement can be reached on waterfowl

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Since 1985, the Service has established uniform migratory bird hunting regulations for tribal members and nonmembers
on the Navajo Indian Reservation (in parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah). The tribe owns almost all lands on the
reservation and has full wildlife management authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a June 18, 1994, communication, the tribe proposed special migratory bird hunting regulations on the reservation
for both tribal and nontribal members for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season for ducks (including mergansers), Canada
geese, coots, band tailed pigeons, and mourning doves. For waterfowl, the Navajo Nation requests the earliest opening
dates and longest seasons, and the same daily bag and possession limits, permitted Pacific Flyway States under final
Federal frameworks, to be announced. For both mourning dove and band-tailed pigeons, the Navajo Nation proposes
seasons of September 1 through 30. The Navajo Nation also proposes daily bag limits of 10 and 5 for mourning dove and
band-tailed pigeon, respectively. Possession limits would be twice the daily bag limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the tribe proposes to require tribal members and nonmembers to comply with all basic Federal migratory
bird hunting regulations in 50 CFR Part 20 regarding shooting hours and manner of taking. In addition, each waterfowl
hunter 16 years of age or over must carry on his/her person a valid Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp (Duck
Stamp) signed in ink across the face. Special regulations established by the Navajo Nation also apply on the reservation.
The Service proposes to approve the Navajo Nation request for these special regulations for the 1994&hyph;95 migratory
bird hunting seasons.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Since 1991&hyph;92, the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin and the Service have cooperated to establish uniform
regulations for migratory bird hunting by tribal and non-tribal hunters within the original Oneida Reservation
boundaries. Since 1985, the Oneida Tribe's Conservation Department has enforced their own hunting regulations
within those original reservation limits. However, the Oneida Tribe has a good working relationship with the State
of Wisconsin and the majority of the seasons and limits are the same for both.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a June 14, 1994, letter to the Service, the tribe proposed special waterfowl hunting regulations. For ducks, geese,
mourning dove and woodcock, the Tribe described the ``outside dates'' (seasons) as being September 1 through November
30, 1994, inclusive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada goose bag limits would be 2 tribally tagged per day; the tribe will reissue 2 tags as each 2 birds are registered.
The possession limit for Canada geese is 4. The Oneida Conservation Department is recommending a season quota of 150
geese taken. If that quota is attained before the season concludes, the Department recommends closing the season
early. For ducks, the daily bag limit is 5, which could include: no more than 3 mallards, with only 1 hen; 4 wood ducks;
1 canvasback; 1 redhead; and 1 hooded merganser. The daily bag limits for mourning dove and woodcock would be 10 and
6, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shooting hours are proposed to be one-half hour before sunrise to sunset. Indians and non-Indians hunting on the Oneida
Indian Reservation or on lands under the jurisdiction of the Oneida Nation will observe all basic Federal migratory
bird hunting regulations found in 50 CFR, except that the tribe proposes to exempt Indian hunters from the purchase
of the Migratory Waterfowl Hunting and Conservation Stamp (``Duck Stamp'') and the plugging of shotguns to limit
capacity to 3 shells.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Since June 1985, the Service has approved a general migratory bird hunting season for both Penobscot tribal members
and nonmembers, under regulations adopted by the State, and a sustenance season that applies only to tribal members.
At the Service's request, the tribe has monitored black duck and other waterfowl harvest during each sustenance season
and has confirmed that it is negligible in size. The waterfowl harvest in the 1993&hyph;94 sustenance season is assumed
to be low and similar to that of the previous seasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Penobscot Nation usually outlines their migratory bird hunting season proposal through the Service's Region
5 Office, however, this year has not provided confirmatory information. The tribe normally requests special sustenance
regulations for tribal members in an area of trust lands that includes but is much larger than the reservation. These
lands were acquired by the tribe in the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement. The tribe would be proposing a 1994&hyph;95
sustenance hunting season of 75 days (September 17&hyph;November 30), with a daily bag limit of 4 ducks, including
no more than 1 black duck and 2 wood ducks. The daily bag limit for geese would include 3 Canada geese or 3 snow geese, or
3 in the aggregate. When the sustenance and Maine's general waterfowl season overlap, the daily bag limit for tribal
members would be only the larger of the two daily bag limits. All other Federal regulations would be observed by tribal
members, including that shooting hours would be from one-half hour before sunrise to sunset.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontribal members hunting within Penobscot Indian Territory would adhere to the seasons and bag limits established
by the State of Maine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service proposes to approve the 1994&hyph;95 regulations put forward by the Penobscot Nation, provided the tribe
provides the appropriate confirmation copies of regulations for the seasons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Crow Creek Indian Reservation has a checkerboard pattern of land ownership, with much of the land owned by non-Indians.
Up until the 1993&hyph;94 season, the tribe observed the waterfowl hunting regulations established by the State
of South Dakota. However, the tribe is continuing to develop a wildlife management program, and in a proposal dated
June 13, 1994, requested that it set its own 1994&hyph;95 special waterfowl hunting regulations as it did for the 1993&hyph;94
hunting season. These regulations would be in accordance with Federal guidelines and independent of the State of
South Dakota seasons. The tribe would have a later, continuous duck season, beginning on October 29 and ending on December
11, 1994, and the same daily bag and possession limits permitted by final Federal frameworks, to be announced. The
requested hunting season dates would probably not be within Federal frameworks. The season and bag limits would be
essentially the same as last year, and harvest is again expected to be low because of the small number of hunters. Estimated
harvest, based on hunter reports, for ducks last season was about 67, including 59 mallards. The tribe states there
may be an increase in the success of duck hunters in the 1994&hyph;95 season due to the shift in season dates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tribe requested that the goose hunting season begin on October 9, 1994, and extend through January 1, 1995. The
daily bag and possession limits would be those permitted by final Federal frameworks, to be announced. Harvest for
last season has been estimated at about 203, of which 191 were Canada geese. This harvest level is less than half of the
estimated harvest for the previous hunting season. Harvest for this coming seasoning should be approximately the
same as last season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service proposes to approve the tribal requests for duck and goose hunting regulations. In the past, the duck regulations
have been continued on an experimental basis; the Service now considers these regulations to be operational. However,
as with all other groups, the Service asks that the tribe continue to survey and report the harvest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
For the first time, in the 1994&hyph;95 migratory bird seasons, the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe and the Service are cooperating
to establish regulations for the Lower Brule Reservation. The Lower Brule Reservation is about 214,000 acres in size
and is located on and adjacent to the Missouri River, south of Pierre. Land ownership on the reservation is mixed, however,
the Lower Brule Tribe currently has full management authority. On-reservation management authority over fish and
wildlife was established for the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe via a MOA with the State of South Dakota, dated October 24,
1986. This MOA will continue until settled by the court. The MOA provides the tribe jurisdiction over fish and wildlife
on reservation lands, including deeded and Corps of Engineers taken lands. Recent meetings between the Lower Brule
Sioux Tribe, the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks and the Service have yielded consensus on the implementation
of this Agreement for the 1994&hyph;95 season. This will allow the public a clear understanding of the Lower Brule
Sioux Wildlife Department license requirements and regulations. The Lower Brule Reservation waterfowl season
is open to tribal and non-tribal hunters alike.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the 1994&hyph;95 migratory bird hunting season, the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe is proposing a duck season length
of 51 days, which would run from October 14 through December 3. The daily bag limit would be 4 ducks, which could include
4 mallards but no more than 1 hen mallard. The goose season would run from October 14 through December 31, with daily
bag limits of 2 Canadas or 2 white-fronted geese, or 2 in the aggregate. The daily bag limit for snow geese would be 10.
Possession limits for the above would be twice the daily bag limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the 1993&hyph;94 season, calculations set the duck harvest at 136, primarily mallards, and the goose harvest
at 3,654, virtually all Canada geese. With these proposed regulations, the duck harvest is anticipated to increase
by 90 and the goose harvest by 500. Estimates of increase are based on conditions in 1994&hyph;95 being the same or similar
to the flight conditions in 1993&hyph;94. All basic Federal regulations contained in 50 CFR Part 20, including the
use of steel shot, Migratory Waterfowl Hunting and Conservation Stamp, etc., would be observed. The Lower Brule Sioux
Tribe has an official Conservation Code that was established by Tribal Council Resolution on June 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service proposes to approve the regulations set out here for the Lower Brule Reservation, provided the Service
and the tribe can come to agreement on restrictions relative to species of concern, e.g., wood ducks, redheads, canvasbacks,
hooded mergansers and pintails.

On May 31, 1994, the Yankton Sioux Tribe submitted a waterfowl hunting proposal for the 1994&hyph;95 season. The Yankton
Sioux tribal waterfowl hunting season would be open to both tribal members and nonmembers. The waterfowl hunting
regulations to be established by this proposal would apply to tribal and trust lands within the external boundaries
of the reservation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The duck (including mergansers) and coot hunting regulations proposed by the Yankton Sioux Tribe, including seasons
and bag limits, are as follows: Season limits would be October 29 to December 6, 1994. The possession limits for ducks
and coots would be twice the daily bag limits, with only double the species restrictions. Daily bag limits would be
4 for ducks and 15 for coots. For ducks, the daily bag limit would include only 3 mallards (of which only 1 may be a hen),
1 redhead, 1 pintail, 2 wood ducks, 1 canvasback and 1 hooded merganser.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The tribe has requested a continuous Canada (including brant), snow and white-fronted goose hunting season, beginning
approximately October 1 and ending on December 18, 1994. The dark goose daily bag limit would be 2 Canada geese and 1
white-fronted goose. For white geese, the daily bag limit would be 10. Possession limits for geese are twice the daily
bag limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A special extended goose season is proposed within the Yankton Sioux Reservation for both tribal and nontribal members.
This season would begin at the close of the regular goose season (December 19, 1994) and continue through January 8,
1995. During this extended season, hunting for geese would be allowed only in the special hunting zone established
by the Yankton Sioux Tribe in the area commonly known as the Chalk Rock Colony (Goose Hunting Unit 2). Bag limit and other
regulations information, as well as maps, for this zone would be available at the Bureau of Indian Affairs Office in
Wagner, South Dakota. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All hunters would have to be in possession of a valid tribal license while hunting on Yankton Sioux trust lands. Tribal
and nontribal hunters would have to comply with all basic Federal migratory bird hunting regulations in 50 CFR Part
20, regarding shooting hours and manner of taking. Special regulations established by the Yankton Sioux Tribe also
apply on the reservation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service proposes to concur with the Yankton Sioux proposal for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season, and requests

For the past several years, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and the State of Montana have entered into
cooperative agreements for the regulation of hunting on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The State and the Tribes
are currently operating under a cooperative agreement signed in 1990 that addresses fishing and hunting management
and regulation issues of mutual concern. This agreement enables all hunters to utilize waterfowl hunting opportunities
on the reservation. Reservation proposed special regulations for waterfowl hunting were submitted to the Service
in a May 20, 1994, letter and would follow regulations for the Montana area of the Pacific Flyway, included in final
Federal frameworks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the past, tribal regulations for non-tribal duck and goose hunters would be at least as restrictive as for the
Pacific Flyway portion of the State and, if circumstances warrant, would provide for early closure of goose hunting.
Early closure may occur on December 4, 1994, in the special goose management unit that will be described in a later rulemaking.
Shooting hours for waterfowl hunting on the Flathead Reservation are sunrise to sunset over the dates to be specified
in the final regulations.

The requested season dates and bag limits are similar to the regulations of the past five years and it is anticipated
there will be no significant changes in harvest levels. Data from check stations indicate the estimated 1993&hyph;94
duck harvest to be 309 and the goose harvest to be 120. A large majority of the harvest is by non-tribal hunters.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Almost all of the Fort Hall Indian Reservation is tribally-owned. The tribes claim full wildlife management authority
throughout the reservation, but the Idaho Fish and Game Department has disputed tribal jurisdiction, especially
for hunting by nontribal members on reservation lands owned by non-Indians. As a compromise, since 1985, the Service
has established the same waterfowl hunting regulations on the reservation and in a surrounding off-reservation
State zone. The regulations were requested by the tribes and provided for different season dates than in the remainder
of the State. The Service agreed to the season dates because it seemed likely that they would provide additional protection
to mallards and pintails; the State concurred with the zoning arrangement. The Service has no objection to the State's
use of this zone again in the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season, provided the duck and goose hunting season dates are the
same as on the reservation. In a May 11, 1994, proposal, for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season, the Shoshone-Bannock
Tribes have requested a continuous duck (including mergansers) season with the maximum number of days and the same
daily bag and possession limits permitted Pacific Flyway States, under final Federal frameworks to be announced.
If 59 days are permitted, as in last year, this could conceivably begin the season on October 22 and conclude it on December
20, 1994, with a later opening and a later closure. Coot and snipe season dates would be the same as for ducks, with the
same daily bag and possession limits permitted Pacific Flyway States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tribes also requested a continuous goose season with the maximum number of days and the same daily bag and possession
limits permitted Idaho under Federal frameworks. The tribes propose that, if the same number of hunting days (93)
are permitted as in previous years, the season would have a later opening (October 8, 1994) and a later closing date
(January 8, 1995) than last year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-tribal hunters must comply with all basic Federal migratory bird hunting regulations in 50 CFR Part 20, regarding
shooting hours and manner of taking. Special regulations established by the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes also apply
on the reservation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Tulalip Tribes are the successors in interest to the Snohomish, Snoqualmie and Skykomish tribes and other tribes
and bands signatory to the Treaty of Point Elliott of January 22, 1855. The Tulalip Tribes government is located on
the Tulalip Indian Reservation at Marysville, Washington. The tribes or individual tribal members own all of the
land on the reservation, and they have full wildlife management authority. All lands within the boundaries of the
Tulalip Tribes Reservation are closed to non-member hunting unless opened by Tulalip Tribal regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter dated May 13, 1994, the Tulalip Tribes proposed tribal and non-tribal hunting regulations for the 1994&hyph;95
seasons as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For ducks and coot, the proposed season for tribal members would be from September 15, 1994, through February 1, 1995.
In the case of non-tribal hunters hunting on the reservation, the season would be the latest closing date and the longest
period of time allowed for the State of Washington under final Federal frameworks, to be announced. Daily bag and possession
limits for Tulalip Tribal members would be 6 and 12 ducks, respectively, except that for blue-winged teal, canvasback,
harlequin, pintail and wood duck the bag and possession limits would be the same as those established for the State
of Washington in accordance with final Federal frameworks. For non-tribal hunters, bag and possession limits would
be the same as those permitted the State of Washington under final Federal frameworks, to be announced. It would be
necessary for non-tribal hunters to check with the Tulalip tribal authorities for additional conservation measures
which may apply for specific species managed within the ``region.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For geese, tribal members are proposed to be allowed to hunt from September 15, 1994, through February 1, 1995. Non-tribal
hunters would be allowed the longest season and the latest closing date permitted for the State of Washington under
final Federal frameworks, to be announced. For tribal hunters, the goose daily bag and possession limits are proposed
to be 6 and 12, respectively, except that the bag limits for brant, cackling Canada geese and dusky Canada geese would
be those established for the Pacific Flyway in accordance with final Federal frameworks, to be announced. For non-tribal
hunters hunting on reservation lands, the daily bag and possession limits would be those established in accordance
with final Federal frameworks for the State of Washington, to be announced. The Tulalip Tribe also sets a maximum annual
bag limit on ducks and geese for those tribal members who engage in subsistence hunting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For snipe, the proposed open seasons follow those regulations for ducks, coot and geese given above. For both tribal
and non-tribal hunters, snipe daily bag and possession limits are proposed to be set at 6 and 12, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All hunters on Tulalip Tribal lands are required to adhere to shooting hour regulations set at one-half hour before
sunrise to sunset, special tribal permit requirements, and a number of other regulations enforced by the tribe. Non-tribal
hunters sixteen years of age and older, hunting pursuant to Tulalip Tribes' Ordinance No. 67, must possess a valid
Federal Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp and a valid State of Washington Migratory Waterfowl Stamp.
Both stamps must be validated through signature across the face in ink. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the season length requested by the Tulalip Tribes appears to be quite liberal, a rough estimate of past harvests
indicates a total take by tribal and non-tribal hunters under 1,000 ducks and 500 geese, annually. The Service intends
to concur with the Tulalip Tribes request for the above seasons and requests that the harvest be monitored closely
and regulations be reevaluated for future years if harvest becomes too great in relation to population numbers.

The Director intends that finally adopted rules be as responsive as possible to all concerned interests. Therefore,
she desires to obtain the comments and suggestions on these proposals from the public, other concerned governmental
agencies, tribal and other Indian organizations, and private interests, and she will take into consideration any
reasonable comments received. Such comments, and any additional information received, may lead the Director to
adopt final regulations differing from these proposals.

Comment Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special circumstances in the establishment of these regulations limit the amount of time that the Service can allow
for public comment. Two considerations compress the time in which this rulemaking process must operate: the need,
on the one hand, for tribes and the Service to establish final regulations before September 1, 1994, and on the other
hand, the unavailability until late July of specific reliable data for each year's status of waterfowl. Therefore,
the Service believes that to allow a comment period past August 31, 1994 is impracticable in terms of publishing timely
rulemakings and contrary to the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the policy of the Department of the Interior, whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may participate by submitting written comments to the
Director, (FWS/MBMO), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, 634 ARLSQ, 1849 C St., NW, Washington,
D.C. 20240. Comments received will be available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Service's
Office of Migratory Bird Management in Room 634, Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA
22203. All relevant comments on the proposals received no later than August 31, 1994 will be considered.

Pursuant to the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(C)),
the ``Final Environmental Statement for the Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory
Birds (FES&hyph;75&hyph;74)'' was filed with the Council on Environmental Quality on June 6, 1975, and notice of
availability was published in the

Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543; 87 Stat. 884), provides that, ``The
Secretary shall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programs in furtherance of the purposes
of this Act'' (and) shall ``insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out *&blank;*&blank;* is not likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction
or adverse modification of [critical] habitat *&blank;*&blank;*'' Consequently, the Service has initiated Section
7 consultation under the Endangered Species Act for the proposed migratory bird hunting seasons including those
which occur on Federally recognized Indian reservations and ceded lands. When completed, the Service's biological
opinion resulting from its consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act may be inspected by the public
in, and/or are available to the public from, the Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservation and the Office
of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240.

Based on the results of soon to be completed migratory game bird studies, and having due consideration for any data
or views submitted by interested parties, this proposed rulemaking may result in the adoption of special hunting
regulations for migratory birds beginning as early as September 1, 1994, on certain Federal Indian reservations,
off-reservation trust lands, and ceded lands. Taking into account both reserved hunting rights and the degree to
which tribes have full wildlife management authority, the regulations only for tribal or for both tribal and nontribal
members may differ from those established by States in which the reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and
ceded lands are located. The regulations will specify open seasons, shooting hours, and bag and possession limits
for rails, coot, gallinules (including moorhen), woodcock, common snipe, band-tailed pigeons, mourning doves,
white-winged doves, ducks (including mergansers) and geese. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The rules that eventually will be promulgated for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season are authorized under the Migratory
Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) of July 3, 1918 (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.), as amended. The MBTA authorizes and directs
the Secretary of the Interior, having due regard for the zones of temperature and for the distribution, abundance,
economic value, breeding habits, and times and lines of flight of migratory game birds, to determine when, to what
extent, and by what means such birds or any part, nest or egg thereof may be taken, hunted, captured, killed, possessed,
sold, purchased, shipped, carried, exported or transported.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to reintroduce the gray wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), an endangered species, into Yellowstone National Park, which is located in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. This population
would be classified as a nonessential experimental population according to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Gray wolf populations have been extirpated from most of the western United States. They
presently occur in a small population in extreme northwestern Montana, and as incidental occurrences of a few wolves
in Idaho, Wyoming, and Washington that result from the dispersal of wolves from Montana and Canada. This reintroduction
is being proposed to reestablish a viable wolf population in the Yellowstone area, one of three wolf recovery areas
that have been identified in the Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan. Potential effects of this proposed rule
were evaluated in an environmental impact statement completed in May 1994. This gray wolf reintroduction would not
conflict with existing or anticipated Federal agency actions or traditional public uses of park lands, wilderness
areas, or surrounding lands.

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1982, P.L. 97&hyph;304, made significant changes to the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 (Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), including the creation of section 10(j), which provides for the designation of specific populations of listed
species as ``experimental populations''. Under previous authorities in the Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) was permitted to reintroduce populations of a listed species into unoccupied portions of its historic
range for conservation and recovery purposes. However, local opposition to reintroduction efforts from certain
parties concerned about potential restrictions, and prohibitions on Federal and private activities contained
in sections 7 and 9 of the Act, reduced the utility of reintroductions as a management tool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 10(j), a reintroduced population of a listed species established outside of its current range, but
within its historic range may be designated, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), as ``experimental.''
The Act requires that an experimental population be separated geographically from nonexperimental populations
of the same species. Furthermore, an experimental population is treated as a threatened species, except that, solely
for section 7 purposes (except for subsection (a)(1)), an experimental population determined not to be essential
to the continued existence of a species is treated, except when it occurs in an area within the National Wildlife Refuge
System or the National Park System, as a species proposed to be listed under section 4 of the Act. Activities undertaken
on private lands are not affected by section 7 of the Act unless they are funded, authorized or carried out by a Federal
agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Experimental and non-essential designations increase the flexibility for management of a reintroduced population
of a listed species. Treatment of such a population as threatened provides the Service with greater latitude in devising
management programs than would be possible for an endangered species. While Section 9 of the Act spells out directly
the prohibitions that apply for endangered species, Section 4(d) of the Act permits adoption by regulation of prohibitions
only to the extent that they are necessary and advisable to promote the conservation of a species listed as threatened.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a nonessential experimental population is not subject to the formal consultation requirement of section
7(a)(2) of the Act unless the experimental population occurs on a National Wildlife Refuge or National Park, where
the full provisions of section 7 apply. Section 7(a)(1) of the Act applies to nonessential experimental populations,
and requires that all Federal agencies use their authorities to conserve listed species. Individual organisms used
in establishing an experimental population can be removed from a source or donor population only after it has been
determined that their removal itself is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species, and a permit
has been issued in accordance with the requirements of 50 CFR 17.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1967, the timber wolf was listed as a subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus lycaon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as endangered (32 FR 4001), and in 1973 the northern Rocky Mountain subspecies, as then understood, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. l. irremotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was also listed as endangered, as was the Texas subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. l. monstrabilis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (38 FR 14678). In 1978, the legal status of the gray wolf in North America was clarified by listing wolves in Minnesota
as threatened and other members of the species south of Canada as endangered, without referring to subspecies (43
FR 9607).

2. Biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal deals with the gray wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), an endangered species of carnivore that was extirpated from the western portion of the conterminous United States
by about 1930. The gray wolf is native to most of North America north of Mexico City, except for the southeastern United
States, which was occupied by a similar species, the red wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis rufus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The gray wolf occupied nearly every area in North America that supported populations of hooved mammals (ungulates),
its major food source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-four distinct subspecies of gray wolf have been recognized in North America. Recently, however, taxonomists
have suggested that there are five or fewer subspecies of gray wolf in North America and that the wolves that once occupied
the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States belonged to a more widely distributed subspecies than was previously
believed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The gray wolf historically occurred in the northern Rocky Mountains, including mountainous portions of Wyoming,
Montana, and Idaho. The great reduction in the distribution and abundance of this species in North America was directly
related to human activities, especially elimination of native ungulates, conversion of wildland into agricultural
lands, and extensive predator control efforts by private, State, and Federal agencies. When most wolves in the conterminous
United States were eradicated, the natural history of wolves was poorly understood. As were other large predators,
it was considered a nuisance and a threat to humans. Today, the gray wolf's role as an important and necessary part of
natural ecosystems is better appreciated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolf reproduction was not detected in the Rocky Mountain portion of the United States for a period of about 50 years
prior to 1986. At that time, a wolf den was discovered near the Canadian border in Glacier National Park. This event
was presumably due to the southern expansion of Canadian wolf populations, and the wolf population in Glacier National
Park has steadily expanded to an estimated size of about 65 wolves that now occupy northwestern Montana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reproducing wolf populations are not known to occur in Idaho or Wyoming. Wolves occasionally have been sighted in
these states, but populations as defined by wolf experts (Service 1994) have not been established. Historical reports
suggest that wolves may have produced young there several times in the past. However, based on extensive surveys and
interagency monitoring efforts (Service 1994), no wolf population has persisted in these States.

In the 1970s, the state of Montana led an interagency recovery team, established by the Service, that developed a recovery
plan for the Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf. That 1980 plan recommended a combination of natural recovery and reintroduction
be used to recover wolf populations in the area around Yellowstone National Park (Park) north to the Canadian border,
including central Idaho. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A revised recovery plan was approved by the Service in 1987 (Service 1987). It identified a recovered wolf population
as being at least 10 breeding pairs of wolves, for 3 consecutive years, in each of 3 recovery areas (northwestern Montana,
central Idaho and the Yellowstone area). A population of this size would comprise approximately 300 wolves. The plan
recommended natural recovery in Montana and Idaho, and using the experimental-population authority of section
10(j) of the Act to quickly reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone National Park and to conduct liberal management to address
local concerns about their potential negative impacts. If 2 wolf packs did not become established in central Idaho
within 5 years, the plan recommended that conservation measures other than natural recovery be considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;512), Congress directed appointment of a Wolf Management Committee, composed of 3 Federal,
3 State and 4 interest group representatives, to develop a plan for wolf restoration to Yellowstone and central Idaho.
That Committee provided a majority, but not unanimous, recommendation to Congress in May 1991. Among the measures
recommended was a declaration by Congress directing reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park, and
possibly central Idaho, as a special nonessential experimental population with particularly flexible management
by agencies and the public to resolve potential conflicts. Wolves and ungulates under that plan would be intensively
managed by the States with Federal funding and thus implementation costs were estimated to be high. Congress took
no action on the Committee's recommendation.

In November 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;154), Congress directed the Service, in consultation with the National Park Service
and Forest Service, to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS), that considered a broad range of alternatives
on wolf reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. In 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;381), Congress
directed the Service to complete the EIS by January 1994 and indicated that the preferred alternative should be consistent
with existing law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service formed and funded an interagency team to prepare the EIS. In addition to the National Park Service and Forest
Service, the States of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana, USDA Animal Damage Control, and the Wind River and Nez Perce Tribes
participated. The Gray Wolf EIS program emphasized public participation. In the spring of 1992, nearly 2,500 groups
or individuals that had previously expressed an interest in wolves were directly contacted and the EIS program was
widely publicized by the news media.

In April 1992, a series of 27 ``issue scoping'' open houses were held in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho and 7 more in other
locations throughout the U.S. The meetings were attended by nearly 1,800 people and thousands of brochures were distributed.
Nearly 4,000 people provided their thoughts on issues they felt should be addressed in the EIS. A report describing
the public's comments was mailed to 16,000 people in July 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1992, another series of 27 ``alternative scoping'' open houses and 3 hearings were held in Wyoming, Montana,
and Idaho. Three other hearings were held in Seattle, WA, Salt Lake City, UT, and Washington D.C. In addition, a copy
of the alternative scoping brochure was inserted into a Sunday edition of the two major newspapers in Montana, Wyoming,
and Idaho (total circulation about 250,000). Nearly 2,000 people attended the meetings and nearly 5,000 comments
were received about different ways that wolf recovery might be managed. Public comments reflected the strong polarization
that has typified management of wolves. A report on the public's ideas and suggestions was mailed to about 30,000 people
in November 1992. In April 1993, a Gray Wolf EIS planning update report was published. It discussed the status of the
EIS, provided factual information about wolves, and requested the public to report observations of wolves in the
northern Rocky Mountains. It was mailed to nearly 40,000 people that had requested information, residing in all 50
states and over 40 foreign countries.

The public comment period on the draft EIS (DEIS) began on July 1, 1993, and the notice of availability was published
July 16. Full DEIS documents were mailed to potentially affected agencies, public libraries, many interest groups
and to all who requested the complete DEIS. In addition, the DEIS summary, a schedule of the 16 hearings, and a request
to report wolf sightings were printed in a flyer that was inserted into the Sunday edition of 6 newspapers in Wyoming,
Montana and Idaho with a combined circulation of about 280,000. In mid-June 1993, the Service sent out a letter to over
300 groups, primarily in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, offering a presentation on the DEIS. As a result, 31 presentations
were given to about 1,000 people during the comment period on the DEIS.

During the public review period from July 1 to November 26, 1993, on the DEIS, comments were received from over 160,200
individuals, organizations, and government agencies. This degree of public response indicated the strong interest
people have in the management of wolves. A summary of the public comments was mailed to about 42,000 people on the EIS
mailing list in early March 1994.

The final EIS was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on May 4, 1994, and a notice of availability was published
on May 9, 1994. The reintroduction of nonessential experimental populations of gray wolves to Yellowstone National
Park and central Idaho was the Service's proposed action. The four alternatives considered in detail in the EIS were
(1) Natural Recovery (No action), (2) No wolf, (3) Wolf Management Committee, and (4) Reintroduction of Nonexperimental
Wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Record of Decision on the EIS was signed by the Secretary of the Interior on June 15, 1994. The Secretary of Agriculture
signed a letter concurring with that decision on July 13, 1994. The decision directed the implementation of the Service's
proposed action as soon as practical.

The Service already has an active wolf management program in Montana because of the presence of breeding pairs of wolves.
About 65 wolves now occupy northwestern Montana, and most of these occur near the Canadian border. The Montana program
monitors wolves to determine their status, encourages research on wolves and their prey, provides accurate information
to the public, and controls wolves that attack domestic livestock. Wolf control consists of translocating wolves
that depredate on livestock to reduce livestock losses, and to foster local tolerance of nondepredating wolves to
promote and enhance the conservation of the species. The control program does not relocate wolves to accelerate the
natural expansion of wolves into unoccupied historic habitat. Wolf control includes removal of wolves that attack
livestock and, although 19 wolves have been removed in that program, the wolf population in Montana has continued
to expand at about 22 percent per year for the past 9 years.

The Service proposes to reintroduce wolves into Yellowstone National Park. The Park was proposed as a site for the
experimental population area after much deliberation by the Service and others. The Park was selected due to several
factors. The vast remote habitats of the Park are under tight Federal controls, and it has high-quality wolf habitat
and good potential wolf release sites. It is also distant from the current southern expansion of naturally formed
wolf packs in Montana. Thus, any wolf pack documented inside the experimental area would likely result from reintroduction
into the Park rather than from natural dispersal from extant wolf populations in Canada or northwestern Montana.
The Service is also proposing establishment of a nonessential experimental population of wolves in central Idaho
in a separate proposal in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has determined that the proposed reintroduction effort in the Park has the greatest potential for successful
recovery of the gray wolf in the conterminous United States, due to ecological and political considerations (Service
1994). Reintroduction of wolves into the Park will enhance wolf population viability by increasing the genetic diversity
of wolves in the Rocky Mountain population, increase genetic interchange between segments of the population, and
is projected to accelerate reaching wolf population recovery goals 20 years sooner than under the current natural
recovery policy. No critical habitat would need to be designated; millions of acres of public land containing hundreds
of thousands of wild ungulates currently provide more than enough habitat to support a recovered population of wolves
in the Park and surrounding area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gray wolves that are reintroduced into the Park would be placed on Federal lands and classified as a nonessential experimental
population. In so doing, the Service would accelerate the recovery of gray wolves in the northwestern United States
while reducing local concerns about excessive government regulation of private lands, uncontrolled livestock
depredations, big game predation, and the lack of State government involvement in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishment of an experimental population of gray wolves in the Park would initiate wolf recovery in one of the three
recovery areas described as necessary for recovery of gray wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains. The only alternative
site identified at this time, central Idaho, is planned for future reintroduction efforts. There are no existing
or anticipated Federal and/or State actions identified for this release site that are expected to have major effects
on this experimental population. For all these reasons, and based on the best scientific and commercial data available,
the Service finds not only that the release of wolves will further the conservation of this endangered species, but
also that the Park constitutes the highest priority reintroduction site that will best serve to further the conservation
of this species.

Gray wolves used for the reintroduction effort would be obtained from healthy wolf populations in Canada by permission
of the Canadian and Provincial governments. Gray wolves are common in western Canada (tens of thousands) and Alaska
(about 7,000) and they are increasing in the Great Lakes area. Thus, the removal of wolves from locations in Canada
would not significantly impact the wolf populations there.

5. Reintroduction Protocol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This wolf reintroduction project is undertaken by the Service in cooperation with the National Park Service; Forest
Service; other Federal agencies; potentially affected Tribes; States of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho; and entities
of the Canadian government. The Service would enter into agreements with the Canadian and provincial governments
and/or Canadian resource management agencies to obtain wild wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wolf reintroduction project in Yellowstone National Park would require the transfer of about 45 to 75 wolves from
southwestern Canada with assistance by Canadian and Provincial governments. About 15 wild wolves would be captured
annually from several different packs over the course of 3&hyph;5 years by trapping, darting from helicopters, or
net gunning in the autumn and winter. They would be transported to the Park by truck or plane. In the Park, groups of wolves,
each consisting of pups and possibly adults from the same packs, would be placed in individual holding pens of about
0.4 hectare (1 acre) size for a period of up to two months to allow for acclimation to the new environment. Acclimation
pens would be isolated and provided maximum protection from humans and other animals, and efforts would be made to
prevent habituation to people. During acclimation, each animal would be monitored with radiotelemetry to ensure
quick retrieval of an animal if necessary. The wolves would be provided carcasses of natural prey taken from the area
where they will be released. In addition, the wolves would receive regular veterinary care, including examinations
and vaccinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In autumn and early winter, about 3 groups of acclimated gray wolf pups, and possibly adult pack members, would be placed
in the individual holding pens at about 3 release sites in the Park. The wolves would be kept and fed in these pens until
about January 1. At that time, the wolves would be radio collared and released. Food (ungulate carrion) would be provided
in the area until the wolves no longer required supplemental feeding. All wolves would be closely monitored each day
or two for the first few weeks, and then the frequency of monitoring would gradually be reduced to about weekly. If wolves
cause conflicts with humans, they will be recaptured and controlled according to the procedures that have been used
with other problem wolves. Based upon previous experience with movements of wild, relocated wolves, it is questionable
whether adults will remain with each other or the pups. The pups would remain in the wild as long as they appeared to be
sustaining themselves on carrion or wild prey. Wolf pups should be capable of killing wild prey by January. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The progress of the reintroduction effort would be reviewed periodically, and the success or failure of the release
would be determined at least on an annual basis. In addition, the release of wild wolves into the Park would be reviewed
and evaluated relative to the effects on the conservation and recovery of the gray wolf in the conterminous United
States. If this reintroduction technique appeared successful, it would be repeated for at least three years or until
two wild breeding pairs produced at least two young for two consecutive years in the Park. At that time, wolves would
be monitored and no further reintroductions would take place unless fewer than 2 litters were produced in a single
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent releases would be modified depending upon information obtained during the previous experiments. Utilizing
information gained from the initial phase of the project, an overall assessment of the success of the reintroduction
would be made after the first year, and for every year thereafter. It is thought that the physical reintroduction phase
would be completed within 3&hyph;5 years. After the reintroduction of wolves has resulted in two packs raising 2 pups
each for 2 consecutive years, the wolf population would be managed to grow naturally toward recovery levels. This
reintroduction attempt is consistent with the recovery goals identified for this species by the 1987 recovery plan
for the northern Rocky Mountain Wolf. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is estimated that this program, in conjunction with natural recovery in northwestern Montana and a similar reintroduction
into central Idaho, would result in a viable recovered wolf population (ten breeding pairs in each of three recovery
areas for three consecutive years) by about the year 2002. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A small portion of Idaho (east of Interstate 15) and Montana (east of Interstate 15 and south of the Missouri River from
Great Falls, Montana to eastern Montana border) and all of Wyoming is proposed as an experimental population area
for wolf reintroduction into the Park. Private landowners and agency personnel adjacent to the Park will continue
to be requested to immediately report any observation of a gray wolf to the Service or to a Service designated agency.
Take of gray wolves by the public would be discouraged by an extensive information and education program and by the
assurance that, at least initially, all animals will be monitored with radio telemetry and therefore easy to locate
when they leave public lands. The public would be encouraged to cooperate with the Service in the attempt to closely
monitor the wolves and quickly resolve any conflicts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More specific information on conduct of the wolf reintroduction program can be obtained from Appendix 4 ``Scientific
techniques for the reintroduction of wild wolves'' in the environmental impact statement: ``The Reintroduction
of Gray Wolves to Yellowstone National Park and Central Idaho'' (Service 1994).

This reintroduced population of gray wolves is proposed to be designated as a nonessential experimental population
according to the provisions of section 10(j) of the Act. As previously stated, the experimental population of wolves
would be treated as a threatened species or species proposed for listing for the purposes of sections 4(d), 7, and 9
of the Act. This enables the Service to propose a special rule that can be less restrictive than the mandatory prohibitions
covering endangered species. In the case of the Yellowstone reintroduction, the biological status of the species,
and the need for management flexibility in reintroducing the gray wolf has resulted in the Service proposing to designate
the reintroduced wolves as ``nonessential''. The Service has found that the nonessential designation, in concert
with protective measures, is necessary to conserve and recover the gray wolf in the Yellowstone ecosystem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that wolves will come in contact with the human population and domestic animals inside and outside
of the Park. Public opinion surveys, public comments on wolf management planning, and the positions taken by elected
local, State, and Federal government officials have indicated that wolves can not be reintroduced without assurances
that current uses of public and private lands would not be disrupted by wolf recovery activities. The following provisions
respond to these concerns. There would be no violation of the Act for unintentional, nonnegligent, and accidental
taking of wolves by the public if incidental to otherwise lawful activities, and taking in defense of human life would
not be prohibited_provided such takings are reported to the Service or to an authorized agency within 24 hours. Certain
Federal, State, and/or Tribal employees would be authorized by the Service to take wolves needing special care or
posing a threat to livestock or property. Livestock owners with grazing allotments on public land and private land
owners or their immediate designates would be permitted to harass adult wolves in an opportunistic non-injurious
manner on their allotments or private property at any time, provided that such harassment would have to be reported
within 7 days to a Service-designated authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed status, livestock owners or their designates could receive a permit from a Service-designated
agency to take (injure or kill) gray wolves that are attacking livestock on permitted public livestock grazing allotments,
but only after 6 or more breeding pairs were established in the Park or experimental area. Such take, moreover, would
only be permitted after due notification to Service designated agencies, unsuccessful efforts to capture the offending
wolf by such agencies, and documentation of additional livestock losses. Private landowners or their designates
would be permitted to take (injure or kill) a wolf in the act of wounding or killing livestock on private land. However,
physical evidence (wounded or dead livestock) that such an attack occurred at the time of the taking would have to be
clearly evident in such instances. Such take would be immediately (within 24 hours) reported to the Service or agencies
authorized by the Service for investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves that repeatedly (2 times in a calendar year) attack domestic animals other than livestock (fowl, swine, goats,
etc.) or pets (dogs or cats) on private property would be designated as problem wolves and would be moved from the area
by the Service or a designated agency. Wolves that depredate on domestic animals after being relocated once after
such previous conflicts would be designated chronic problem wolves and be removed from the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is unlikely that wolf predation on big game populations will be the primary cause for failure of States or Tribes
to meet their specific big game management objectives outside National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges. Nor
is such predation likely to inhibit wolf population increases. However, if the Service deemed it necessary, wolves
from the responsible packs could be translocated to other sites in the experimental area to resolve such predation
problems. Wolves could not be deliberately killed to resolve wolf predation conflicts with big game while the experimental
population of wolves were listed. However, such take is expected to be rare and is unlikely to significantly affect
the overall rate of wolf recovery. The States and Tribes would define such situations in their Service-approved wolf
management plans before such actions could be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves would be moved on a case-by-case basis to enhance wolf recovery in the experimental population area. Generally
there would not be attempts to locate and/or move lone wolves dispersing in this area, although this may occur.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hunting, trapping, and animal damage control activities are regulated inside and outside National Parks and National
Wildlife Refuges. Most of the area within the wolf reintroduction area is remote and sparsely inhabited wild lands.
There are some risks to wolf recovery that would be associated with take of wolves, other land uses, and various recreational
activities. However, these risks are low because take of wolves should occur so infrequently that wolf recovery would
not be significantly affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service finds that the stated protective measures and management practices are necessary and advisable for the
conservation and recovery of the gray wolf in the Park. No additional Federal regulations appear to be needed. The
Service also finds that the proposed nonessential experimental status is appropriate for gray wolves released in
Yellowstone National Park that are taken from wild populations. As discussed above, although once extirpated from
its historic range in most of the conterminous United States, the gray wolf is common in western Canada (tens of thousands)
and Alaska (about 7,000), and wolves are increasing in the Great Lakes area. The gray wolf has also recently been recovering
in a small portion of its range in the western United States. Therefore, taking fewer than 100 wolves from these areas
will pose no threat to the survival of the species in the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional management flexibility would result from using the nonessential status for wolves introduced into
the Park, due to less stringent requirements of section 7 of the Act (interagency consultation) for wolves that may
occur outside National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges. Wolves that are part of the nonessential experimental
population would be treated as animals proposed for listing, rather than listed, when occurring outside of a National
Park or Refuge, and only two provisions of section 7 apply to Federal actions outside National Parks and Wildlife Refuges:
section 7(a)(l), which authorizes all Federal agencies to establish conservation programs; and section 7(a)(4),
which requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on actions that are likely to jeopardize the
continued existence of the species. The results of a conference are advisory in nature; agencies are not required
to refrain from commitment of resources to projects as a result of a conference. There are, in reality, no conflicts
envisioned with any current or anticipated management actions of the Forest Service or other Federal agencies in
the areas. National Forests are a benefit to the project because they form a buffer to private properties in many areas,
and National Forests are typically managed to produce wild animals that would be prey to wolves. The Service finds
that there are no threats to the success of the reintroduction project or the overall continued existence of the gray
wolf from the less restrictive section 7 requirements associated with the nonessential designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The full provisions of section 7 apply to nonessential experimental populations in a National Park or National Wildlife
Refuge. The Service, National Park Service, Forest Service or any other Federal agency is prohibited from authorizing,
funding, or carrying out an action within a National Park or National Wildlife Refuge that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of the gray wolf. Pursuant to 50 CFR 17.83(b), section 7 determinations must consider all
experimental and nonexperimental wolves as a single listed species for analysis purposes. The Service has reviewed
all ongoing and proposed uses of the Parks and Refuges and found none that are likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of the gray wolf, nor will they adversely affect the success of the reintroduction program. Potential uses that could
adversely affect success are hunting, trapping, animal damage control activities and high speed vehicular traffic.
Hunting and trapping and USDA Animal Damage Control programs are prohibited or tightly regulated in National Parks
and are closely regulated by State and Federal law and policy in other areas. There are very few paved roads in the proposed
reintroduction area and wolf encounters with vehicles are likely to be infrequent. Even most of the unpaved roads
are used seasonally, and are on the outside fringes of the reintroduction area. In addition, these unpaved roads typically
have low vehicle traffic and are constructed for low speed use.

Location of Experimental Population

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The release site for reintroducing wolves will be in Yellowstone National Park. The experimental population area
will include all of the State of Wyoming, that portion of Idaho east of Interstate Highway 15, and all the State of Montana
east of Interstate Highway 15 and south of the Missouri River east of Great Falls, Montana, to the Montana/North Dakota
border. Comments obtained by the Service during review of the DEIS resulted in changing the boundary of the experimental
population area to the Missouri River in central Montana (Service 1994). The Missouri River was chosen as the northern
boundary because the record of wolf sightings and wolf mortalities indicated that, during the last several decades,
wolves have occurred north, but not south of the river. The river may not act as a complete barrier to wolf movements,
but current information indicates that, if wolves are found south of the river, they would likely be experimental
wolves from the Yellowstone area. Wolves north of the river would likely be naturally dispersing wolves from northwestern
Montana or Canada.

The proposed experimental area does not currently support reproducing pairs of wolves nor is it likely to support
2 pairs of naturally dispersing wolves from northwestern Montana within the next 3 years, at which time the reintroduced
population should be growing and potentially dispersing into Montana and central Idaho. Except for an established
and growing population of gray wolves in northwestern Montana, only gray wolf individuals have been documented in
the remainder or the northern Rocky Mountains in the United States. Thus, the Yellowstone National Park reintroduction
is consistent with provisions of section 10(j) of the Act that requires that an experimental population be wholly
separate geographically from nonexperimental populations of the same species. An occasional, solitary wolf has
been reported, killed, or otherwise documented in Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, and other western States, and single
packs occasionally have been reported throughout the northern Rocky Mountains. However, these reported wolves
and groups of wolves, if all reports are factual, apparently disappeared for unknown reasons and did not establish
recoverable ``populations'' as defined by wolf experts (Service 1994). However, it is possible that prior to 2002,
other wolves may appear in the wild, and be attracted to the experimental area by the presence of the reintroduced wolves,
or by other factors. These ``new'' wolves that appear in the experimental population area might contribute to recovery
of the experimental population, and they also would be classified as part of the experimental, nonessential population.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that some wolves may disperse from the experimental area and contribute to wolf recovery in northwestern
Montana. If so, these wolves would be classified as endangered, as in the case of wolves that recolonized an area near
Glacier National Park in 1982. It is also possible, but not probable, that during the next 3 years, movements between
recovery areas would result in some genetic exchange between wolves resulting from natural recovery and those resulting
from the reintroduction. It is not anticipated that such exchange will significantly affect the rate of recovery
in the Yellowstone National Park experimental population area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of establishment of this experimental population, the Service has determined that there is no existing
wolf population in the recovery area that would preclude reintroduction and establishment of an experimental population
in Yellowstone National Park. A wolf population is defined as at least two breeding pairs of naturally occurring gray
wolves that successfully raise at least two young to December 31 of their birth year for two consecutive years (Service
1994). If a wolf population were discovered in the proposed recovery area, no reintroduction would occur. Instead,
the success of the naturally occurring wolf population would be monitored to determine if population recovery was
continuing. If this event occurs before the effective date of the experimental population rule, those wolves would
be determined to be, and managed as, endangered wolves under the full authority of the Act. In this case, the experimental
rule would not be implemented, and no wolves would be reintroduced in that experimental area. If wolf population growth
does not continue, and within 5 years the wolf population has not doubled from the original founding pairs and pups,
reintroduction would proceed. Wolves will not be introduced as an experimental population if, prior to introduction
of wolves, breeding groups of wolves are discovered. However, once the experimental population rule is established
and the reintroduction begun by the actual release of wolves into a recovery area, the experimental population rule
would remain in effect until wolf recovery occurs or after a scientific review indicates that modifications in the
experimental rule are necessary to achieve wolf recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a wolf population (2 breeding pairs successfully raising two young each for two consecutive years) were discovered
in the proposed Yellowstone experimental population area, reintroduction under an experimental population rule
would not occur into that area and any such wolf population would be managed as a natural recovering population in that
area. The boundaries of the proposed experimental population area would be changed, as needed, to encourage recovery
of any naturally occurring, breeding wolf population if such natural population is discovered prior to the establishment
of the experimental population, and before wolf reintroduction occurs. No experimental population area will contain
a portion of the home range of any active breeding pairs of wolves that have successfully raised young. Any changes
in the boundaries of the nonessential experimental population area, required because of the above conditions, would
be reflected in a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utilization of Federal public lands including National Parks and Forests is consistent with the legal responsibility
of the National Park Service to sustain the native wildlife resources of the United States, and of the Forest Service
and all other Federal agencies under section 7(a)(1) to utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes
of the Act by carrying out programs for the conservation of endangered species and threatened species.

As previously stated, the nonessential experimental population of gray wolves would be established in the Yellowstone
area by introducing gray wolves into Yellowstone National Park under authority of section 10(j) of the Act, as amended.
The Yellowstone area includes all of Wyoming and parts of Montana and Idaho that surround the Park. Ongoing wolf monitoring
efforts (Service 1994) would continue to document the presence of any wild wolves, and, prior to any reintroduction,
the Service would make a determination of the status of any naturally occurring wolf population in this area. Wolves
would not be reintroduced into the Park if a wolf population is documented in the recovery area. After introduction
has been completed according to the Reintroduction Protocol (section 5 above), management of the experimental population
will begin.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Park Service will be the primary agency implementing the experimental population rule inside the boundaries
of National Parks. The States of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and potentially affected Tribes will be encouraged
to enter into cooperative agreements for management of the gray wolf in the Park. These cooperative agreements would
be reviewed annually by the Service to ensure that the States and Tribes have adequate regulatory authority to conserve
listed species, including the gray wolf. It is anticipated that the States and Tribes will be the primary agencies
implementing this experimental population rule outside National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges. The Service
will provide oversight, coordinate wolf recovery activities, and provide technical assistance. If the States and
Tribes do not assume wolf management responsibilities, the Service would do so, as needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management of the reintroduced wolves would allow wolves to be killed or moved under some conditions by Service authorized
Federal, State, and Tribal agencies for domestic animal depredations and excessive predation on big game populations.
Under some conditions, the public could harass or kill wolves attacking livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules).
There would be no Federal compensation program, but compensation from existing private funding sources would be
encouraged. There would be no land-use restrictions applied when 6 or more wolf packs were documented in the experimental
population area because sufficient wolf numbers would be available and no restrictions around den sites or other
critical areas would be necessary to promote wolf recovery. Enhancement of prey populations would be encouraged.
Use of toxicants lethal to wolves in areas occupied by wolves would still be prohibited by existing labeling restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves have a relatively high reproductive rate and, with 6 packs of wolves present in a population, about 20&hyph;25
pups could be born each year to greatly compensate for mortality which would result from management actions. The Service
believes that a possible 10 per cent loss of wolves could occur due to control actions and an additional 10 per cent loss
could occur from other mortality sources. However, once the number of introduced wolves has reached the goal of 6 wolf
packs, the reproductive output of 6 packs of wolves would provide for a wolf population increasing at or near 22 per
cent per year. This increase in numbers should easily accommodate more flexible wolf management to further address
local concerns and resistance to wolf recovery efforts, and reduce the need and costs of agency actions to resolve
wolf/human conflicts. Closely regulated public control also can more effectively focus on individual problem wolves
as conflicts occur rather than hours or days after a problem is documented. Agency control actions would more likely
target groups of wolves that contain problem individuals, whereas public control could be focused on individual
problem wolves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, or States and Tribes if authorized, may move wolves that are having unacceptable impacts on ungulate
populations in the unlikely event that those impacts would inhibit wolf recovery. Wolves could be moved to other places
within the experimental population area. Two examples are where wolf predation is dramatically affecting prey availability
because of unusual habitat or weather conditions (e.g., bighorn sheep in areas with marginal escape habitat) or where
wolves cause prey to move onto private property and mix with livestock, increasing potential conflicts. The States
and Tribes will define such unacceptable impacts, how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation
in their State or Tribal management plans. These plans would be approved by the Service through cooperative agreement
before such control could be conducted. Wolves would not be deliberately killed to address ungulate-wolf conflicts.
These unacceptable impacts would be identified in State and Tribal wolf management plans and developed in consultation
with the Service. If such control by the States or Tribes were likely to be significant or beyond the provisions of the
experimental rule as determined by the Service, then they would be specifically incorporated as part of an amendment
to this experimental rule, which would be adopted following national public comment and review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Management of wolves in the experimental population would not result in any major change in existing private or public
land-use restrictions (except at containment facilities during reintroduction) after 6 breeding pairs of wolves
are established in this experimental area. When 5 or fewer breeding pairs are in this experimental area, land-use
restrictions could be employed on an as needed basis, at the discretion of land management and natural resources agencies
to control intrusive human disturbance. Temporary restrictions on human access, when 5 or fewer breeding pairs are
established, may be required near active wolf den sites between April 1 and June 30.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, or Federal, State or Tribal agencies authorized by the Service would be allowed to promptly remove any
wolf of the experimental population that the Service, or agency authorized by the Service, determined was presenting
a threat to human life or safety. Although not a management option 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, it is noted that a person could legally kill or injure wolves in response to an immediate threat to human life. The incidental
and accidental nonnegligent take in the course of otherwise lawful recreational activity, or take in defense of human
life, would be permitted by the Service and Service-authorized agencies, provided that such taking is immediately
(within 24 hours) reported to the authorized State or Federal authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service or State, Federal, or Tribal agencies designated by the Service will control wolves that attack livestock
(cattle, sheep, horses, and mules) by management measures that may include aversive conditioning, nonlethal control,
and/or moving wolves when 5 or fewer breeding pairs are established, and by previously described measures. However,
killing wolves or placing them in captivity may be considered and used as management options after 6 or more breeding
pairs are established in the experimental population area. For depredation occurring on public land and prior to
6 breeding pairs becoming established, depredating females and their pups would be released on site prior to October
1. Wolves on private land under these circumstances would be moved. Wolves that attack other domestic animals and
pets on private land 2 times in a calendar year would be moved. Chronic problem wolves (wolves that depredate on domestic
animals after being moved for previous domestic animal depredations) would be removed from the wild.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, other Federal agencies, and Tribal and State Wildlife Agency personnel would be additionally authorized
and should be prepared to take wolves under special circumstances where there was an immediate threat to livestock
or property, or a need to move individuals for genetic purposes. Wolves could be captured alive and translocated to
resolve demonstrated conflicts with State big-game management objectives or when they were outside designated
wolf pack recovery areas. Take procedures in such instances would involve live capture and removal to a remote area,
or if the animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild, return to a captive facility. Killing of animals would be a last
resort and would be authorized only if live capture attempts fail or there is some clear danger to human life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service and other authorized management agencies would use the following conditions and criteria in determining
the problem status of wolves within the nonessential experimental population area:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Wounded livestock or some remains of a livestock carcass must be present with clear evidence (Roy and Dorrance
1976: Fritts 1982) that wolves were responsible for the damage and there must be reason to believe that additional
losses would occur if the problem wolf or wolves were not controlled. Such evidence is essential since wolves may feed
on carrion they have found while not being responsible for the kill.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Artificial or intentional feeding of wolves must not have occurred. Livestock carcasses not properly disposed
of in an area where depredations have occurred will be considered attractants. On Federal lands, removal or resolution
of such attractants must accompany any control action. Livestock carrion or carcasses on Federal land, not being
used as bait in an authorized control action (by agencies authorized by the Service), must be removed, buried, burned,
or otherwise disposed of so that the carcass(es) will not attract wolves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On Federal lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and
annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Final Federal responsibility for protection of gray wolves in the experimental population under provisions of the
Act would cease after: (1) A minimum of 10 breeding pairs are documented for three consecutive years in each of the three
recovery areas presented by the revised wolf recovery plan (Service 1987), and evaluated by the environmental impact
statement (Service 1994), providing that legal mechanisms are in place to conserve this population, and (2) gray
wolves in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming are delisted according to provisions of the Act. The Act specifies that the status
of a species must be monitored for a 5-period after delisting. If, after delisting, the wolf population fell below
the minimum criteria of 10 breeding pairs in any recovery area for two of three consecutive years, wolves in that area
would be considered for relisting under the Act.

This proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The rule will not
have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act
(5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on the information discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within the experimental
population area, significant economic impacts will not result from this action. Also, no direct costs, enforcement
costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this action and the
rule contains no record-keeping requirements, as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This rule does not require federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612 because it would not have any significant
federalism effects as described in the order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The gray wolf (wolf) population identified in paragraph (&blank;)(6) of this section is a nonessential experimental
population. This population will be managed in accordance with the respective provisions of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No person may take this species in the wild in an experimental population area except as provided in paragraphs
(&blank;)(2), (4), and (7) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Landowners on their private land and livestock producers (i.e., producers of cattle, sheep, horses, and mules
or as defined in State and Tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service) that are legally using public land
(Federal land and any other public lands designated in State and Tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service)
may harass any adult wolf (a wolf that does not exceed 50 lbs in weight is not considered an adult for these purposes)
in an opportunistic noninjurious manner at any time, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that all such harassment is by methods that are not lethal or physically injurious to the gray wolf and is reported within
7 days to the Service project leader for wolf reintroduction or agency representative designated by the Service.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any livestock producers on their private land may take (including to kill or injure) adult wolves in the act of
killing, wounding, or biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or as defined in State and Tribal wolf management
plans as approved by the Service), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that such incidents must be reported immediately but no later than within 24 hours to the Service project leader for
wolf reintroduction or agency representative designated by the Service, and livestock freshly (less than 24 hours)
wounded (torn flesh and bleeding) or killed by wolves must be evident. Service or other Service authorized agencies
will confirm if livestock were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any wolf without such evidence may be referred
to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. A gray wolf that does not exceed 50 lbs in weight is not considered
an adult and can not be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Any livestock producer or permittee with livestock grazing allotments on public land may receive a written
permit from the Service or other agencies designated by the Service, to take (including to kill or injure) adult wolves
that are in the act of killing, wounding, or biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or as defined in State
and Tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that 6 or more breeding pairs of wolves have been documented in that experimental population area and that the Service
or other agencies authorized by the Service has confirmed that the livestock losses have been caused by wolves and
has unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the problem and subsequent livestock losses are documented. Such take must
be reported immediately but no later than within 24 hours to the Service project leader for wolf reintroduction or
agency representative designated by the Service and livestock freshly wounded or killed by wolves must be evident.
Service or other Service authorized agencies will confirm if livestock were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking
of any wolf without such evidence may be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The potentially affected States and Tribes may move wolves to other areas within an experimental population
area as described in paragraph (&blank;)(6), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the level of wolf predation is having unacceptable impacts on localized ungulate populations and to the extent
that those impacts could inhibit wolf recovery. The States and Tribes will define such unacceptable impacts, how
they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation in their State or Tribal wolf management plans. These
plans must be approved by the Service through cooperative agreement before such movement of wolves may be conducted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The Service, or agencies authorized by the Service may promptly remove (place in captivity or kill) any wolf the
Service or agency authorized by the Service determines to present a threat to human life or safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Any person may harass or take (kill or injure) a wolf in self defense or in defense of others, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that all such take is reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the Service reintroduction project leader or Service
designated agent. The taking of any wolf without such evidence of an immediate and direct threat to human life may be
referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(vii) The Service or agencies designated by the Service may take wolves that are designated as ``problem wolves''
(as defined below) that attack livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or domestic animals or as defined by State
and Tribal wolf management plans approved by the Service) by nonlethal measures, including but not limited to: aversive
conditioning, nonlethal control, and/or moving wolves when 5 or fewer breeding pairs are established, and by previously
described measures. If such measures result in a wolf mortality, it must be demonstrated that such mortality was nondeliberate.
Lethal control of wolves or placing them in permanent captivity will be allowed only after 6 or more breeding pairs
are established in the experimental population area. For depredations occurring on federally managed lands and
any additional public lands identified in State or Tribal wolf management plans and prior to 6 breeding pairs becoming
established, depredating female wolves with pups and their pups will be released at or near the site of capture prior
to October 1. Wolves on private land under these circumstances will be moved to other areas within the experimental
population area. Wolves that attack domestic animals other than livestock, including pets on private land, a total
of 2 times in a calendar year will be moved. All chronic problem wolves (wolves that depredate on domestic animals after
being moved once for previous domestic animal depredations) will be removed from the wild (killed or placed in captivity).
The following three conditions and criteria will apply in determining the problem status of wolves within the nonessential
experimental population area: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Wounded livestock or some remains of a livestock carcass must be present with clear evidence that wolves were responsible
for the damage and there must be reason to believe that additional losses would occur if the problem wolf or wolves were
not controlled. Such evidence is essential because wolves may feed on carrion they have found and may not be responsible
for the death of livestock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Artificial or intentional feeding of wolves must not have occurred. Livestock carcasses not properly disposed
of in an area where depredations have occurred will be considered attractants. On Federal lands, removal or resolution
of such attractants must accompany any control action. Livestock carrion or carcasses on Federal land, not being
used as bait in an authorized control action (by agencies authorized by the Service), must be removed, buried, burned,
or otherwise disposed of such that the carcass(es) will not attract wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) On Federal lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and
annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Any person may take gray wolves found in an area defined in paragraph (&blank;)(6), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that, the take is incidental, accidental, unavoidable, unintentional, and not resulting from negligent conduct
lacking reasonable due care in the course of otherwise lawful recreational activity, and that such taking is immediately
(within 24 hours) reported to the authorized Service or Service-designated authority. Take that does not conform
with such provisions may be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Service or other Federal, State, or Tribal personnel may be additionally authorized in writing by the Service
to take animals under special circumstances that pose an immediate threat to livestock or property, or when animals
need to be moved for genetic purposes. Wolves may be live captured and translocated to resolve demonstrated conflicts
with ungulate populations or with other species listed under the Endangered Species Act, or when they are outside
the designated experimental population area. Take procedures in such instances would involve live capture and release
to a remote area, or if the animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild, return to a captive facility. Killing of animals
will be a last resort and will be authorized only if live capture attempts fail or there is some clear danger to human
life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Any person with a valid permit issued by the Service under &sect;17.32 may take wolves in the wild in the experimental
population area, pursuant to terms of the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Any employee or agent of the Service or appropriate Federal, State or Tribal agency, who is designated in writing
for such purposes by the Service, when acting in the course of official duties, may take a wolf in the wild in the experimental
population area if such action is necessary: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) For scientific purposes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) To relocate wolves to avoid conflict with human activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) To relocate wolves within the experimental population areas to improve wolf survival and recovery prospects;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(D) To relocate wolves that have moved outside the experimental population area back into the experimental population
area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) To aid or euthanize sick, injured, or orphaned wolves; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) To salvage a dead specimen which may be used for scientific study; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) To aid in law enforcement investigations involving wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) Any taking pursuant to this section must be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the appropriate Service
or Service-designated agency, which will determine the disposition of any live or dead specimens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Human access to areas with facilities where wolves are confined may be restricted at the discretion of Federal,
State, and Tribal land management agencies. When 5 or fewer breeding pairs are in an experimental population area,
land-use restrictions may also be employed on an as-needed basis, at the discretion of Federal land management and
natural resources agencies to control intrusive human disturbance around active wolf den sites. Such temporary
restrictions on human access, when 5 or fewer breeding pairs are established in an experimental population area,
may be required between April 1 and June 30, within 1 mile of active wolf den or rendezvous sites. When 6 or more breeding
pairs are established in an experimental population area, no land use restrictions may be employed outside of National
Parks or National Wildlife Refuges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, import, or export by any means whatsoever, any
wolf or part thereof from the experimental populations taken in violation of these regulations or in violation of
applicable State or Tribal fish and wildlife laws or regulations or the Endangered Species Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense
defined in paragraphs (&blank;)(2) through (4) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The site for reintroduction is within the historic range of the species: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Yellowstone Management area is shown on the following map. The boundaries of the nonessential experimental
population area will be that portion of Idaho that is east of Interstate Highway 15; that portion of Montana that is
east of Interstate Highway 15 and south of the Missouri River from Great Falls, Montana, to the eastern Montana border;
and all of Wyoming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) [Reserved] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) All wolves found in the wild within the boundaries of this paragraph (&blank;)(6) after the first releases will
be considered nonessential experimental animals. In the conterminous United States, a wolf that is outside an experimental
area (as defined in paragraph (&blank;)(6) of this section) would be considered as endangered (or threatened if in
Minnesota) unless it is marked or otherwise known to be an experimental animal; such a wolf may be captured for examination
and genetic testing by the Service or Service-designated agency. Disposition of the captured animal may take any
of the following courses: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the animal was not involved in conflicts with humans and is determined likely to be an experimental wolf, it will
be returned to the reintroduction area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the animal is determined likely to be an experimental wolf and was involved in conflicts with humans as identified
in the management plan for the closest experimental area it may relocated, placed in captivity, or killed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If the animal is determined not likely to be an experimental animal, it will be managed according to any Service
approved plans for that area or will be marked and released near its point of capture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) If the animal is determined not to be a wild grey wolf or if the Service or agencies designated by the Service determine
the animal shows substantial evidence of recent hybridization with other canids such as domestic dogs or coyotes
or of being an animal raised in captivity, it will be returned to captivity or killed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The reintroduced wolves will be continually monitored during the life of the project, including by the use of radio
telemetry and other remote sensing devices as appropriate. All released animals will be vaccinated against diseases
and parasites prevalent in canids, as appropriate, prior to release and during subsequent handling. Any animal that
is sick, injured, or otherwise in need of special care may be captured by authorized personnel of the Service or Service
designated agencies and given appropriate care. Such an animal will be released back into its respective reintroduction
area as soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral problems make it necessary to return the animal to captivity
or euthanize it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The status of the experimental population will be reevaluated within the first 5 years after the first year of releases
of wolves to determine future management needs. This review will take into account the reproductive success and movement
patterns of the individuals released in the area, as well as the overall health of the experimental wolves. Once recovery
goals are met for downlisting or delisting the species, a rule will be proposed to address downlisting or delisting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The Service does not intend to reevaluate the ``nonessential experimental'' designation. The Service does not
foresee any likely situation which would result in changing the nonessential experimental status until the gray
wolf is recovered and delisted in the Northern Rocky Mountains according to provisions outlined in the Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to reintroduce the gray wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), an endangered species, into central Idaho in order to establish a population of wolves. This population would be
classified as a nonessential experimental population according to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of
1973, as amended (Act). Gray wolves have been extirpated from most of the western United States. They presently occur
in a small population in extreme northwestern Montana, and as incidental occurrences of a few wolves in Idaho, Wyoming,
and Washington that result from the dispersal of wolves from Montana and Canada. This reintroduction is being proposed
to reestablish a viable wolf population in the central Idaho area (including a portion of southwestern Montana),
one of three wolf recovery areas that have been identified in the Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan. Potential
effects of this proposed rule were evaluated in an environmental impact statement completed in May 1994. This gray
wolf reintroduction would not conflict with existing or anticipated Federal agency actions or traditional public
uses of park lands, wilderness areas, or surrounding lands.

1. Legal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendments of 1982, P.L. 97&hyph;304, made significant changes to the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended
(16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), including the creation of section 10(j), which provides for the designation of specific populations of listed
species as ``experimental populations''. Under previous authorities in the Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) was permitted to reintroduce populations of a listed species into unoccupied portions of its historic
range for conservation and recovery purposes. However, local opposition to reintroduction efforts from certain
parties concerned about potential restrictions, and prohibitions on Federal and private activities contained
in sections 7 and 9 of the Act, reduced the utility of reintroductions as a management tool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 10(j), a reintroduced population of a listed species established outside its current range, but within
its historic range may now be designated, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), as ``experimental.''
The Act requires that an experimental population be separated geographically from nonexperimental populations
of the same species. Furthermore, an experimental population is treated as a threatened species, except that, solely
for section 7 purposes (except for subsection (a)(1)), an experimental population determined not to be essential
to the continued existence of a species is treated, except when it occurs in an area within the National Wildlife Refuge
System or the National Park System, as a species proposed to be listed under section 4 of the Act. Activities undertaken
on private lands are not affected by section 7 of the Act unless they are funded, authorized or carried out by a Federal
agency.

2. Biological
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal deals with the gray wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), an endangered species of carnivore that was extirpated from the western portion of the conterminous United States
by about 1930. The gray wolf is native to most of North America north of Mexico City, except for the southeastern United
States, which was occupied by a similar species, the red wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis rufus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The gray wolf occupied nearly every area in North America that supported populations of hooved mammals (ungulates),
its major food source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-four distinct subspecies of gray wolf have been recognized in North America. Recently, however, taxonomists
have suggested that there are five or fewer subspecies of gray wolf in North America and that the wolves that once occupied
the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States belonged to a more widely distributed subspecies than was previously
believed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The gray wolf historically occurred in the northern Rocky Mountains, including mountainous portions of Wyoming,
Montana, and Idaho. The great reduction in the distribution and abundance of this species in North America was directly
related to human activities, especially elimination of native ungulates, conversion of wildland into agricultural
lands, and extensive predator control efforts by private, State, and Federal agencies. When most wolves in the conterminous
United States were eradicated, the natural history of wolves was poorly understood. As were other large predators,
it was considered a nuisance and a threat to humans. Today, the gray wolf's role as an important and necessary part of
natural ecosystems is better appreciated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolf reproduction was not detected in the Rocky Mountain portion of the United States for a period of about 50 years
prior to 1986. At that time, a wolf den was discovered near the Canadian border in Glacier National Park. This event
was presumably due to the southern expansion of Canadian wolf populations, and the wolf population in Glacier National
Park has steadily expanded to an estimated size of about 65 wolves that now occupy northwestern Montana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reproducing wolf populations are not known to occur in Idaho or southwestern Montana. Wolves occasionally have been
sighted in these States, but they have not established populations as defined by wolf experts (Service 1994). Historical
reports suggest wolves may have produced young there several times in the recent past. However, based on extensive
surveys and interagency monitoring efforts (Service 1994), no wolf population has persisted in these States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Wolf Recovery Efforts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 1970s, the state of Montana led an interagency recovery team, established by the Service, that developed a recovery
plan for the Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf. That 1980 plan recommended a combination of natural recovery and reintroduction
be used to recover wolf populations in the area around Yellowstone National Park (Park) north to the Canadian border,
including central Idaho. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A revised recovery plan was approved by the Service in 1987 (Service 1987). It identified a recovered wolf population
as being at least 10 breeding pairs of wolves, for 3 consecutive years, in each of 3 recovery areas (northwestern Montana,
central Idaho and the Yellowstone area). A population of this size would comprise approximately 300 wolves. The plan
recommended natural recovery in Montana and Idaho, and using the experimental-population authority of section
10(j) of the Act to quickly reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone National Park and to conduct flexible management to
address local concerns about their potential negative impacts. If 2 wolf packs did not become established in central
Idaho within 5 years, the plan recommended that conservation measures other than natural recovery be considered.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;512), Congress directed appointment of a Wolf Management Committee, composed of 3 Federal,
3 State and 4 interest group representatives, to develop a plan for wolf restoration to Yellowstone and central Idaho.
That Committee provided a majority, but not unanimous, recommendation to Congress in May 1991. Among the measures
recommended was a declaration by Congress directing reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park, and
possibly central Idaho, as a special nonessential experimental population with particularly liberal management
by agencies and the public to resolve potential conflicts. Wolves and ungulates under that plan would be intensively
managed by the States with Federal funding and thus implementation costs were estimated to be high. Congress took
no action on the Committee's recommendation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In November 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;154), Congress directed the Service, in consultation with the National Park Service
and Forest Service, to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS), that considered a broad range of alternatives
on wolf reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. In 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;381), Congress
directed the Service to complete the EIS by January 1994 and indicated that the preferred alternative should be consistent
with existing law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service formed and funded an interagency team to prepare the EIS. In addition to the National Park Service and Forest
Service, the States of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana, USDA Animal Damage Control, and the Wind River and Nez Perce Tribes
participated. The Gray Wolf EIS program emphasized public participation. In the spring of 1992, nearly 2,500 groups
or individuals that had previously expressed an interest in wolves were directly contacted and the EIS program was
widely publicized by the news media. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In April 1992, a series of 27 ``issue scoping'' open houses were held in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho and 7 more in other
locations throughout the U.S. The meetings were attended by nearly 1,800 people and thousands of brochures were distributed.
Nearly 4,000 people provided their thoughts on issues they felt should be addressed in the EIS. A report describing
the public's comments was mailed to 16,000 people in July 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1992, another series of 27 ``alternative scoping'' open houses and 3 hearings were held in Wyoming, Montana,
and Idaho. Three other hearings were held in Seattle, WA, Salt Lake City, UT, and Washington DC. In addition, a copy
of the alternative scoping brochure was inserted into a Sunday edition of the two major newspapers in Montana, Wyoming,
and Idaho (total circulation about 250,000). Nearly 2,000 people attended the meetings and nearly 5,000 comments
were received about different ways that wolf recovery might be managed. Public comments reflected the strong polarization
that has typified management of wolves. A report on the public's ideas and suggestions was mailed to about 30,000 people
in November 1992. In April 1993, a Gray Wolf EIS planning update report was published. It discussed the status of the
EIS, provided factual information about wolves, and requested the public to report observations of wolves in the
northern Rocky Mountains. It was mailed to nearly 40,000 people that had requested information, residing in all 50
states and over 40 foreign countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public comment period on the draft EIS (DEIS) began on July 1, 1993, and the notice of availability was published
July 16. Full DEIS documents were mailed to potentially affected agencies, public libraries, many interest groups
and to all who requested the complete DEIS. In addition, the DEIS summary, a schedule of the 16 hearings, and a request
to report wolf sightings were printed in a flyer that was inserted into the Sunday edition of 6 newspapers in Wyoming,
Montana and Idaho with a combined circulation of about 280,000. In mid-June 1993, the Service sent out a letter to over
300 groups, primarily in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho offering a presentation on the DEIS. As a result, 31 presentations
were given to about 1,000 people during the comment period on the DEIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the public review period from July 1 to November 26, 1993, on the DEIS, comments were received from over 160,200
individuals, organizations, and government agencies. This degree of public response indicated the strong interest
people have in the management of wolves. A summary of the public comments was mailed to about 42,000 people on the EIS
mailing list in early March 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final EIS was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on May 4, 1994, and a notice of availability was published
on May 9, 1994. The reintroduction of nonessential experimental populations of gray wolves to Yellowstone National
Park and central Idaho was the Service's proposed action. The four alternatives considered in detail in the EIS were
(1) Natural Recovery (No action), (2) No wolf, (3) Wolf Management Committee, and (4) Reintroduction of Nonexperimental
Wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Record of Decision on the EIS was signed by the Secretary of the Interior on June 15, 1994. The Secretary of Agriculture
signed a letter concurring with that decision on July 13, 1994. The decision directed the implementation of the Service's
proposed action as soon as practical.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service already has an active wolf management program in Montana because of the presence of breeding pairs of wolves.
About 65 wolves now occupy northwestern Montana, and most of these occur near the Canadian border. The Montana program
monitors wolves to determine their status, encourages research on wolves and their prey, provides accurate information
to the public, and controls wolves that attack domestic livestock. Wolf control consists of translocating wolves
that depredate on livestock to reduce livestock losses, and to foster local tolerance of non-depredating wolves
to promote and enhance the conservation of the species. The control program does not relocate wolves to accelerate
the natural expansion of wolves into unoccupied historic habitat. Wolf control includes removal of wolves that attack
livestock and, although 19 wolves have been removed from 1986 to present in northwestern Montana, the wolf population
in Montana has continued to expand at about 22 per cent per year for the past 9 years.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Reintroduction Site
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service proposes to reintroduce wolves into Federal lands managed by the USDA Forest Service. The Idaho location
was proposed as a site for this experimental population area after much deliberation by the Service and others. The
central Idaho reintroduction site is a vast area of about 53,000 km2 (20,000 mi2) of contiguous National forests,
including the Bitterroot, Boise, Challis, Clearwater, Nez Perce, Payette, Sawtooth, Salmon, and Panhandle National
Forests. In the center of this area are three wilderness areas, the Frank Church River-of-no-Return, Selway-Bitterroot,
and the Gospel-Hump Wilderness Areas that collectively comprise about 16,000 km2 (6,000 mi2) of wilderness habitat.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This vast area of Federal lands has high quality wolf habitat and good potential wolf release sites. Also, the central
Idaho area is sufficiently distant from the current southern expansion of naturally formed wolf packs in Montana
that any wolf pack documented inside the experimental area would likely result from reintroduction rather than from
natural dispersal from extant wild wolf populations in Canada or northwestern Montana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has determined that the proposed reintroduction effort in central Idaho is necessary for the successful
recovery of the gray wolf in the conterminous United States, due to ecological and landownership considerations
(Service 1994). Reintroduction of wolves into central Idaho will enhance wolf population viability by increasing
the genetic diversity of wolves in the Rocky Mountain population, increase genetic interchange between segments
of the population, and is projected to accelerate reaching wolf population recovery goals 20 years sooner than under
the current natural recovery policy. No critical habitat would be designated; millions of acres of public lands contain
hundreds of thousands of wild ungulates (Service 1994) and currently provide more than enough habitat to support
a recovered population of wolves in central Idaho. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gray wolves that are reintroduced into central Idaho would be placed on Federal lands. By doing so, the Service would
accelerate the recovery of the gray wolf in the northwestern United States while reducing local concerns about excessive
government regulation of private lands, uncontrolled livestock depredations, big game predation, and the lack
of State government involvement in the program. There are only a few scattered parcels of private and State of Idaho
lands in the area in which wolves would be reintroduced (Service 1994), and no conflicts with private or State land
use is anticipated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishment of an experimental population of gray wolves in central Idaho would initiate wolf recovery in one of
the three recovery areas described as necessary for recovery of gray wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains. The only
other reintroduction site identified at this time, Yellowstone National Park, is also the subject of a proposal to
establish a nonessential experimental population published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. There are no existing or anticipated Federal or State actions identified for this release site that are expected
to have major effects on this experimental population. For all these reasons, and based on the best scientific and
commercial data available, the Service finds that the release of wolves and the establishment of an experimental
population in central Idaho and southwestern Montana will further the conservation of this endangered species.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gray wolves used for the reintroduction effort would be obtained from healthy wolf populations in Canada by permission
of the Canadian and Provincial governments. Gray wolves are common in western Canada (tens of thousands) and Alaska
(about 7,000) and they are increasing in the Great Lakes area. Thus, the removal of wolves from locations in Canada
would not significantly impact the wolf populations there. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Reintroduction Protocol
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This wolf reintroduction project is undertaken by the Service in cooperation with the USDA Forest Service, other
Federal agencies, potentially affected Tribes, States of Idaho and Montana, and entities of the Canadian government.
The Service would enter into agreements with the Canadian and provincial governments and/or Canadian resource management
agencies to obtain wild wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wolf reintroduction project in the central Idaho area would require the transfer of about 45 to 75 wolves from southwestern
Canada with assistance by Canadian and Provincial governments. About 15 wild wolves would be captured annually from
several different packs over the course of 3&hyph;5 years by trapping, darting from helicopters, or net gunning in
the autumn and winter. Upon capture, the wolves would receive veterinary care, including examinations and vaccinations
as necessary, and they would be transported to central Idaho by truck or plane. In central Idaho, groups of wolves,
each consisting of young adults from various packs, would be fitted with radio collars, released in several areas,
and monitored by radiotelemetry. This method is referred to as a ``hard release'', i.e., the wolves would be released
upon or shortly after transport to each release site. Wolves to be released would not be held on site for acclimation,
nor would any food or care be provided after they were released. It is anticipated that the wolves will move widely,
but eventually find mates and form packs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All wolves would be monitored by radiotelemetry, and if wolves cause conflicts with humans, they will be recaptured
and controlled according to the procedures that have been used with other problem wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent releases would be modified depending upon information obtained during the reintroduction effort. Utilizing
information gained from the initial phase of the project, an overall assessment of the success of the reintroduction
would be made after the first year, and for every year thereafter. It is thought that the physical reintroduction phase
will be completed within 3&hyph;5 years. After the reintroduction of wolves has resulted in two packs raising 2 pups
each for 2 consecutive years, the wolf population will be managed to grow naturally toward recovery levels. This reintroduction
attempt is consistent with the recovery goals identified for this species by the 1987 recovery plan for the northern
Rocky Mountain Wolf. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is estimated that this program, in conjunction with natural recovery in northwestern Montana and a similar reintroduction
into Yellowstone National Park, would result in a viable recovered wolf population (ten breeding pairs in each of
three recovery areas for three consecutive years) by about the year 2002.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Private landowners and agency personnel that manage properties adjacent to Federal lands used as release areas will
be requested to immediately report any observation of a gray wolf to the Service or to a Service-designated agency.
Take of gray wolves by the public will be discouraged by an extensive information and education program and by the assurance
that, at least initially, all animals will be monitored with radio telemetry and therefore easy to locate when they
leave public lands. The public would be encouraged to cooperate with the Service in the attempt to closely monitor
the wolves and quickly resolve any conflicts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More specific information on conduct of the wolf reintroduction program can be obtained from Appendix 4 ``Scientific
techniques for the reintroduction of wild wolves'' in the environmental impact statement: ``The Reintroduction
of Gray Wolves to Yellowstone National Park and Central Idaho'' (Service 1994).

Status of Reintroduced Population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Gray wolves would be reintroduced into central Idaho in order to establish a nonessential experimental population
according to the provisions of section 10(j) of the Act. As previously stated, the experimental population of wolves
would be treated as a threatened species or species proposed for listing for the purposes of sections 4(d), 7, and 9
of the Act. This enables the Service to propose a special rule that can be less restrictive than the mandatory prohibitions
covering endangered species. In the case of the central Idaho reintroduction, the biological status of the species,
and the need for management flexibility in reintroducing the gray wolf, has resulted in the Service proposing to designate
the reintroduced wolves as ``nonessential''. The Service has found that the nonessential designation, in concert
with protective measures, is necessary to conserve and recover the gray wolf in central Idaho and southwestern Montana.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that wolves will occasionally come in contact with the human population and domestic animals. Public
opinion surveys, public comments on wolf management planning, and the positions taken by elected local, State, and
Federal government officials have indicated that wolves cannot be reintroduced without assurances that current
uses of public and private lands would not be disrupted by wolf recovery activities. The following provisions respond
to these concerns. There would be no violation of the Act for unintentional, nonnegligent, and accidental taking
of wolves by the public if incidental to otherwise lawful activities, and taking in defense of human life would not
be prohibited_provided such takings are reported to the Service or to an authorized agency within 24 hours. Certain
Federal, State, and/or Tribal employees would be authorized by the Service to take wolves needing special care or
posing a threat to livestock or property. Livestock owners with grazing allotments on public land and private land
owners or their immediate designates would be permitted to harass adult wolves, i.e., wolves larger than about 23
Kg (50 lbs), in an opportunistic non-injurious manner on their allotments or private property at any time, provided
that such harassment would have to be reported within 7 days to a Service-designated authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed status, livestock owners or their designates could receive a permit from a Service-designated
agency to take (injure or kill) gray wolves that are attacking livestock on permitted public livestock grazing allotments,
but only after 6 or more breeding pairs were established in the experimental area. Such take, however, would only be
permitted after due notification to Service-designated agencies, unsuccessful efforts to capture the offending
wolf by such agencies, and documentation of additional livestock losses. Private landowners or their designates
would be permitted to take (injure or kill) a wolf in the act of wounding or killing livestock on private land. However,
physical evidence (wounded or dead livestock) that such an attack occurred at the time of the taking would have to be
clearly evident in such instances. Such take would be immediately (within 24 hours) reported to the Service or agencies
authorized by the Service for investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves that repeatedly (2 times in a calendar year) attack domestic animals other than livestock (fowl, swine, goats,
etc.) or pets (dogs or cats) on private property would be designated as problem wolves and would be moved from the area
by the Service or a designated agency. Wolves that depredate on domestic animals after being relocated once after
such previous conflicts would be designated chronic problem wolves and be removed from the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is unlikely that wolf predation on big game populations will be the primary cause for failure of States or Tribes
to meet their specific big game management objectives outside National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges. Nor
is such predation likely to inhibit wolf population increases. However, if the Service deemed it necessary, wolves
from the responsible packs could be translocated to other sites in the experimental area to resolve such predation
problems. Wolves could not be deliberately killed to resolve wolf predation conflicts with big game while the experimental
population of wolves were listed. However, such take is expected to be rare and is unlikely to significantly affect
the overall rate of wolf recovery. The States and Tribes would define such situations in their Service-approved wolf
management plans before such actions could be taken.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wolves would be moved on a case-by-case basis to enhance wolf recovery in the experimental population area. Generally
there would not be attempts to locate and/or move lone wolves dispersing in this area, although this may occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hunting, trapping, and animal damage control activities are regulated inside and outside National Parks and National
Wildlife Refuges. Most of the area within the wolf reintroduction area is remote and sparsely inhabited wild lands.
There are some risks to wolf recovery that would be associated with take of wolves, other land uses, and various recreational
activities. However, these risks are low because take of wolves should occur so infrequently that wolf recovery would
not be significantly affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service finds that the stated protective measures and management practices are necessary and advisable for the
conservation and recovery of the gray wolf in central Idaho and southwestern Montana. No additional Federal regulations
appear to be needed. The Service also finds that the proposed nonessential experimental status is appropriate for
gray wolves released in central Idaho that are taken from unendangered wild populations. As discussed above, although
once extirpated from its historic range in most of the conterminous United States, the gray wolf is common in western
Canada (tens of thousands) and Alaska (about 7,000) and they are increasing in the Great Lakes area. The gray wolf has
also recently been recovering in a small portion of its range in the western United States. Therefore, taking fewer
than 100 wolves from Canada will pose no threat to the survival of the species in the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional management flexibility would result from using the nonessential status for wolves introduced into
the central Idaho, due to less stringent requirements of section 7 of the Act (interagency consultation) for wolves
that may occur outside National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges. Wolves that are part of the nonessential experimental
population would be treated as animals proposed for listing, rather than listed, when occurring outside of a National
Park or National Wildlife Refuge, and only two provisions of section 7 apply to Federal actions outside National parks
and refuges: section 7 (a)(l), which authorizes all Federal agencies to establish conservation programs; and section
7(a)(4), which requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on actions that are likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of the species. The results of a conference are advisory in nature; agencies are not required
to refrain from commitment of resources to projects as a result of a conference. There are no conflicts envisioned
with any current or anticipated management actions of the Forest Service or other Federal agencies in the reintroduction
area. National Forests are typically managed in such a fashion as to produce wild animals that would be natural prey
to wolves. The Service finds that there are no threats to the success of the reintroduction project or the overall continued
existence of the gray wolf from the less restrictive section 7 requirements associated with the nonessential designation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The full provisions of section 7 apply to nonessential experimental populations in a National Park or National Wildlife
Refuge. The Service, Forest Service, or any other Federal agency is prohibited from authorizing, funding, or carrying
out an action within a National Park or National Wildlife Refuge that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of the gray wolf. Pursuant to 50 CFR 17.83(b), section 7 determinations consider all experimental and nonexperimental
wolves as a single listed species for analysis purposes. The Service has reviewed all ongoing and proposed uses of
the affected National Forests and found none that are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the gray wolf,
nor will such uses adversely affect the success of the reintroduction program. Potential uses that could adversely
affect success are hunting, trapping, animal damage control activities and high speed vehicular traffic. Hunting
and trapping, and USDA Animal Damage Control programs are prohibited or tightly regulated in National Forests and
are closely regulated by State and Federal law and policy in other areas. There are very few paved roads in the proposed
reintroduction area, and wolf encounters with vehicles are likely to be infrequent. Even most of the unpaved roads
are used seasonally. In addition, these unpaved roads typically have low vehicle traffic and are constructed for
low-speed use.

Location of Experimental Population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The release site for reintroducing wolves will be on National Forest lands in central Idaho. The experimental population
area will include that portion of Idaho and Montana that is west of Interstate 15 and south of Interstate 90. Current
information indicates that, if wolves are found south of Interstate 90, they would likely be experimental wolves
from the central Idaho area. Wolves north of the Interstate 90 would likely be naturally dispersing wolves from northwestern
Montana or Canada.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed experimental area does not currently support reproducing pairs of wolves, nor is it likely that 2 pairs
of naturally dispersing wolves from northwestern Montana would, within the next 3 years, move into the area and establish
a breeding population of wolves. In 3 years, the number of reintroduced wolves should be growing and potentially dispersing
into other areas, including Montana and the proposed Yellowstone reintroduction area. Except for an established
and growing population of gray wolves in northwestern Montana, only gray wolf individuals have been documented in
the remainder of the northern Rocky Mountains in the United States. Thus, the central Idaho reintroduction site is
consistent with provisions of section 10(j) of the Act that requires that an experimental population be wholly separate
geographically from nonexperimental populations of the same species. An occasional, solitary wolf has been reported,
killed, or otherwise documented in Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, and other western States, and single packs occasionally
have been reported throughout the northern Rocky Mountains. However, these reported wolves and groups of wolves,
if all reports are factual, apparently disappeared for unknown reasons and did not establish recoverable ``populations''
as defined by wolf experts (Service 1994). However, it is possible that prior to 2002, other wolves may appear in the
wild, and be attracted to the experimental area by the presence of the reintroduced wolves, or by other factors. These
``new'' wolves that appear in the experimental population area might contribute to recovery of the experimental
population, and they also would be classified as part of the nonessential experimental population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that some wolves may disperse from the experimental area and contribute to wolf recovery in northwestern
Montana. If so, these wolves would be classified as endangered, as in the case of wolves that recolonized an area near
Glacier National Park in 1982. It is also possible, but not probable, that during the next 3 years, movements between
recovery areas may result in some genetic exchange between wolves resulting from natural recovery and those resulting
from the reintroduction. It is not anticipated that such exchange will significantly affect the rate of recovery
in the central Idaho experimental population area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of establishment of this experimental population, the Service has determined that there is no existing
wolf population in the recovery area that would preclude reintroduction and establishment of an experimental population
in the central Idaho area. A wolf population is defined as at least two breeding pairs of naturally occurring gray wolves
that successfully raise at least two young to December 31 of their birth year for two consecutive years (Service 1994).
If a wolf population were discovered in the proposed recovery area, no reintroduction would occur. Instead, the success
of the naturally occurring wolf population would be monitored to determine if population recovery was continuing.
If this event occurs before the effective date of the experimental population rule, those wolves would be determined
to be, and managed as, endangered wolves under the full authority of the Act. In this case, the experimental rule would
not be implemented, and no wolves would be reintroduced in that experimental area. If wolf population growth does
not continue, and within 5 years the wolf population has not doubled from the original founding animals, reintroduction
would proceed. Wolves will not be reintroduced if, prior to introduction of wolves, breeding groups of wolves are
discovered. However, once the experimental population rule is established and the reintroduction begun by the actual
release of wolves into a recovery area, the experimental population rule would remain in effect until wolf recovery
occurs or after a scientific review indicates that modifications in the experimental rule are necessary to achieve
wolf recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a wolf population (2 breeding pairs successfully raising two young each for two consecutive years) were discovered
in the proposed central Idaho experimental population area, reintroduction under an experimental population rule
would not occur in that area and any such wolf population would be managed as a natural recovering population in that
area. The boundaries of the proposed experimental population area would be changed, as needed, to encourage recovery
of any naturally occurring, breeding wolf population if such natural population is discovered prior to the establishment
of the experimental population, and before wolf reintroduction occurs. No experimental population area will contain
a portion of the home range of any active breeding pairs of wolves that have successfully raised young. Any changes
in the boundaries of the nonessential experimental population area, required because of the above conditions, would
be reflected in a final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is possible that an exchange of reintroduced wolves may occur between the central Idaho area and an experimental
area established by reintroducing wolves into Yellowstone National Park. Such interchange, if it occurs, would
pose no problem in determining their status because wolves from both areas would already be classified as part of nonessential
experimental population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utilization of Federal public lands including National Forests is consistent with the legal responsibility of the
Forest Service and all other Federal agencies under section 7(a)(1) of the Act to utilize their authorities in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act by carrying out programs for the conservation of endangered species and threatened species.

Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously stated, the nonessential experimental population of gray wolves would be established in central Idaho
by introducing gray wolves into Federal lands under authority of section 10(j) of the Act, as amended. Ongoing wolf
monitoring efforts (Service 1994) would continue to document the presence of any wild wolves, and, prior to any reintroduction,
the Service would make a determination of the status of any naturally occurring wolf population in this area. Wolves
would not be reintroduced into central Idaho if a naturally occurring wolf population is documented in the recovery
area. After introduction has been completed according to the Reintroduction Protocol (section 5 above), management
of the experimental population will begin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service and the Service will be the primary Federal agencies implementing the experimental population
rule inside the boundaries of a National Forest. The States of Idaho and Montana and potentially affected Tribes will
be encouraged to enter into cooperative agreements for management of the gray wolf in central Idaho and southwestern
Montana. These cooperative agreements would be reviewed annually by the Service to ensure that the States and Tribes
have adequate regulatory authority to conserve listed species, including the gray wolf. It is anticipated that the
States and Tribes will be the primary agencies implementing this experimental population rule outside National
Parks and National Wildlife Refuges. The Service will provide oversight, coordinate wolf recovery activities,
and provide technical assistance. If the States and Tribes do not assume wolf management responsibilities, the Service
would do so, as needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management of the reintroduced wolves would allow wolves to be killed or moved under some conditions by Service-authorized
Federal, State, and Tribal agencies for domestic animal depredations and excessive predation on big game populations.
Under some conditions, the public could harass or kill wolves attacking livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules).
There would be no Federal compensation program, but compensation from existing private funding sources would be
encouraged. There would be no land-use restrictions applied when 6 or more wolf packs were documented in the experimental
population area because sufficient wolf numbers would be available and no restrictions around den sites or other
critical areas would be necessary to promote wolf recovery. Enhancement of prey populations would be encouraged.
Use of toxicants lethal to wolves in areas occupied by wolves would still be prohibited by existing labeling restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves have a relatively high reproductive rate and, with 6 packs of wolves present in a population, about 20&hyph;25
pups could be born each year to greatly compensate for mortality that would result from management actions. The Service
believes that a possible 10 per cent loss of wolves could occur due to control actions and an additional 10 per cent loss
could occur from other mortality sources. However, once the number of introduced wolves has reached the goal of 6 wolf
packs, the reproductive output of 6 packs of wolves would provide for a wolf population increasing at or near 22 per
cent per year. This increase in numbers should easily accommodate more flexible wolf management to further address
local concerns and resistance to wolf recovery efforts, and reduce the need and costs of agency actions to resolve
wolf/human conflicts. Closely regulated public control also can more effectively focus on individual problem wolves
as conflicts occur rather than hours or days after a problem is documented. Agency control actions would more likely
target groups of wolves that contain problem individuals, whereas public control could be focused on individual
problem wolves.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service, or States and Tribes if authorized, may move wolves that are having unacceptable impacts on ungulate
populations in the unlikely event that those impacts would inhibit wolf recovery. Wolves could be moved to other places
within the experimental population area. Two examples are where wolf predation is dramatically affecting prey availability
because of unusual habitat or weather conditions (e.g., bighorn sheep in areas with marginal escape habitat) or where
wolves cause prey to move onto private property and mix with livestock, increasing potential conflicts. The States
and Tribes will define such unacceptable impacts, how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation
in their State or Tribal management plans. These plans would be approved by the Service through cooperative agreement
before such control could be conducted. Wolves would not be deliberately killed to resolve ungulate-wolf conflicts.
These unacceptable impacts would be identified in State and Tribal wolf management plans and developed in consultation
with the Service. If such control by the States or Tribes were likely to be significant or beyond the provisions of the
experimental rule as determined by the Service, then they would be specifically incorporated as part of an amendment
to this experimental rule, which would include national public comment and review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management of wolves in the experimental population would not result in any major change in existing private or public
land-use restrictions after 6 breeding pairs of wolves are established in this experimental area. When 5 or fewer
breeding pairs are in this experimental area, land-use restrictions could be employed on an as needed basis, at the
discretion of land management and natural resources agencies to control intrusive human disturbance. Temporary
restrictions on human access, when 5 or fewer breeding pairs are established, may be required near active wolf den
sites between April 1 and June 30.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, or Federal, State or Tribal agencies authorized by the Service would be allowed to promptly remove any
wolf of the experimental population that the Service, or agency authorized by the Service, determined was presenting
a threat to human life or safety. Although not a management option 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it is noted that a person could legally kill or injure wolves in response to an immediate threat to human life. The incidental
and accidental nonnegligent take in the course of otherwise lawful recreational activity or take in defense of human
life, would be permitted by the Service and Service-authorized agencies, provided that such taking is immediately
(within 24 hours) reported to the authorized State or Federal authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service or State, Federal, or Tribal agencies designated by the Service will control wolves that attack livestock
(cattle, sheep, horses, and mules) by management measures that may include aversive conditioning, nonlethal control,
and/or moving wolves when 5 or fewer breeding pairs are established, and by previously described measures. However,
killing wolves or placing them in captivity may be considered and used as management options after 6 or more breeding
pairs are established in the experimental population area. For depredation occurring on public land and prior to
6 breeding pairs becoming established, depredating females and their pups would be released on site prior to October
1. Wolves on private land under these circumstances would be moved. Wolves that attack other domestic animals and
pets on private land 2 times in a calendar year would be moved. Chronic problem wolves (wolves that depredate on domestic
animals after being moved for previous domestic animal depredations) would be removed from the wild.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, other Federal agencies, and Tribal and State wildlife agency personnel would be additionally authorized
and should be prepared to take wolves under special circumstances where there was an immediate threat to livestock
or property, or need to move individuals for genetic purposes. Wolves could be captured alive and translocated to
resolve demonstrated conflicts with State big-game management objectives or when they were outside designated
wolf pack recovery areas. Take procedures in such instances would involve live capture and removal to a remote area,
or if the animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild, return to a captive facility. Killing of animals would be a last
resort and would be authorized only if live capture attempts fail or there is some clear danger to human life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service and other authorized management agencies would use the following conditions and criteria in determining
the problem status of wolves within the nonessential experimental population area:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Wounded livestock or some remains of a livestock carcass must be present with clear evidence (Roy and Dorrance
1976, Fritts 1982) that wolves were responsible for the damage, and there must be reason to believe that additional
losses would occur if the problem wolf or wolves were not controlled. Such evidence is essential since wolves may feed
on carrion they have found while not being responsible for the kill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Artificial or intentional feeding of wolves must not have occurred. Livestock carcasses not properly disposed
of in an area where depredations have occurred will be considered attractants. On Federal lands, removal or resolution
of such attractants must accompany any control action. Livestock carrion or carcasses on Federal land, not being
used as bait in an authorized control action (by agencies authorized by the Service), must be removed, buried, burned,
or otherwise disposed of so that the carcass(es) will not attract wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On Federal lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and
annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Final Federal responsibility for protection of gray wolves in the experimental population under provisions of the
Act would cease after: (1) a minimum of 10 breeding pairs are documented for three consecutive years in each of the three
recovery areas presented by the revised wolf recovery plan (Service 1987), and evaluated by the environmental impact
statement (Service 1994), providing that legal mechanisms are in place to conserve this population, and (2) gray
wolves in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming are delisted according to provisions of the Act. The Act specifies that the status
of a species must be monitored for a 5-period after delisting. If, after delisting, the wolf population fell below
the minimum criteria of 10 breeding pairs in any recovery area for two of three consecutive years, wolves in that area
would be considered for relisting under the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. The rule
will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on the information discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within the experimental
population area, significant economic impacts will not result from this action. Also, no direct costs, enforcement
costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this action and the
rule contains no record-keeping requirements, as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This rule does not require federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612 because it would not have any significant
federalism effects as described in the order.

 (&blank;)(2), (4), and (7) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Landowners on their private land and livestock producers (i.e., producers of cattle, sheep, horses, and mules
or as defined in State and Tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service) that are legally using public land
(Federal land and any other public lands designated in State and Tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service)
may harass any adult wolf (a wolf that does not exceed 50 lbs in weight is not considered an adult for these purposes)
in an opportunistic noninjurious manner at any time, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that all such harassment is by methods that are not lethal or physically injurious to the gray wolf and is reported within
7 days to the Service project leader for wolf reintroduction or agency representative designated by the Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any livestock producers on their private land may take (including to kill or injure) adult wolves in the act of
killing, wounding, or biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or as defined in State and Tribal wolf management
plans as approved by the Service), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that such incidents must be reported immediately but no later than within 24 hours to the Service project leader for
wolf reintroduction or agency representative designated by the Service, and livestock freshly (less than 24 hours)
wounded (torn flesh and bleeding) or killed by wolves must be evident. Service or other Service authorized agencies
will confirm if livestock were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any wolf without such evidence may be referred
to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. A gray wolf that does not exceed 50 lbs in weight is not considered
an adult and can not be taken.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Any livestock producer or permittee with livestock grazing allotments on public land may receive a written
permit from the Service or other agencies designated by the Service, to take (including to kill or injure) adult wolves
that are in the act of killing, wounding, or biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or as defined in State
and Tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that 6 or more breeding pairs of wolves have been documented in that experimental population area and that the Service
or other agencies authorized by the Service has confirmed that the livestock losses have been caused by wolves and
has unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the problem and subsequent livestock losses are documented. Such take must
be reported immediately but no later than within 24 hours to the Service project leader for wolf reintroduction or
agency representative designated by the Service and livestock freshly wounded or killed by wolves must be evident.
Service or other Service authorized agencies will confirm if livestock were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking
of any wolf without such evidence may be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The potentially affected States and Tribes may move wolves to other areas within an experimental population
area as described in paragraph (&blank;)(6), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the level of wolf predation is having unacceptable impacts on localized ungulate populations and to the extent
that those impacts could inhibit wolf recovery. The States and Tribes will define such unacceptable impacts, how
they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation in their State or Tribal wolf management plans. These
plans must be approved by the Service through cooperative agreement before such movement of wolves may be conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The Service, or agencies authorized by the Service may promptly remove (place in captivity or kill) any wolf the
Service or agency authorized by the Service determines to present a threat to human life or safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Any person may harass or take (kill or injure) a wolf in self defense or in defense of others, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that all such take is reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the Service reintroduction project leader or Service
designated agent. The taking of any wolf without such evidence of an immediate and direct threat to human life may be
referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(vii) The Service or agencies designated by the Service may take wolves that are designated as ``problem wolves''
(as defined below) that attack livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or domestic animals or as defined by State
and Tribal wolf management plans approved by the Service) by nonlethal measures, including but not limited to: aversive
conditioning, nonlethal control, and/or moving wolves when 5 or fewer breeding pairs are established, and by previously
described measures. If such measures result in a wolf mortality, it must be demonstrated that such mortality was nondeliberate.
Lethal control of wolves or placing them in permanent captivity will be allowed only after 6 or more breeding pairs
are established in the experimental population area. For depredations occurring on federally managed lands and
any additional public lands identified in State or Tribal wolf management plans and prior to 6 breeding pairs becoming
established, depredating female wolves with pups and their pups will be released at or near the site of capture prior
to October 1. Wolves on private land under these circumstances will be moved to other areas within the experimental
population area. Wolves that attack domestic animals other than livestock, including pets on private land, a total
of 2 times in a calendar year will be moved. All chronic problem wolves (wolves that depredate on domestic animals after
being moved once for previous domestic animal depredations) will be removed from the wild (killed or placed in captivity).
The following three conditions and criteria will apply in determining the problem status of wolves within the nonessential
experimental population area:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Wounded livestock or some remains of a livestock carcass must be present with clear evidence that wolves were responsible
for the damage and there must be reason to believe that additional losses would occur if the problem wolf or wolves were
not controlled. Such evidence is essential because wolves may feed on carrion they have found and may not be responsible
for the death of livestock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Artificial or intentional feeding of wolves must not have occurred. Livestock carcasses not properly disposed
of in an area where depredations have occurred will be considered attractants. On Federal lands, removal or resolution
of such attractants must accompany any control action. Livestock carrion or carcasses on Federal land, not being
used as bait in an authorized control action (by agencies authorized by the Service), must be removed, buried, burned,
or otherwise disposed of such that the carcass(es) will not attract wolves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) On Federal lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and
annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Any person may take gray wolves found in an area defined in paragraph (&blank;)(6), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that, the take is incidental, accidental, unavoidable, unintentional, and not resulting from negligent conduct
lacking reasonable due care in the course of otherwise lawful recreational activity, and that such taking is immediately
(within 24 hours) reported to the authorized Service or Service-designated authority. Take that does not conform
with such provisions may be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Service or other Federal, State, or Tribal personnel may be additionally authorized in writing by the Service
to take animals under special circumstances that pose an immediate threat to livestock or property, or when animals
need to be moved for genetic purposes. Wolves may be live captured and translocated to resolve demonstrated conflicts
with ungulate populations or with other species listed under the Endangered Species Act, or when they are outside
the designated experimental population area. Take procedures in such instances would involve live capture and release
to a remote area, or if the animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild, return to a captive facility. Killing of animals
will be a last resort and will be authorized only if live capture attempts fail or there is some clear danger to human
life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Any person with a valid permit issued by the Service under &sect;17.32 may take wolves in the wild in the experimental
population area, pursuant to terms of the permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Any employee or agent of the Service or appropriate Federal, State or Tribal agency, who is designated in writing
for such purposes by the Service, when acting in the course of official duties, may take a wolf in the wild in the experimental
population area if such action is necessary:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) For scientific purposes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) To relocate wolves to avoid conflict with human activities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) To relocate wolves within the experimental population areas to improve wolf survival and recovery prospects;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(D) To relocate wolves that have moved outside the experimental population area back into the experimental population
area;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) To aid or euthanize sick, injured, or orphaned wolves;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) To salvage a dead specimen which may be used for scientific study; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) To aid in law enforcement investigations involving wolves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) Any taking pursuant to this section must be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the appropriate Service
or Service-designated agency, which will determine the disposition of any live or dead specimens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Human access to areas with facilities where wolves are confined may be restricted at the discretion of Federal,
State, and Tribal land management agencies. When 5 or fewer breeding pairs are in an experimental population area,
land-use restrictions may also be employed on an as-needed basis, at the discretion of Federal land management and
natural resources agencies to control intrusive human disturbance around active wolf den sites. Such temporary
restrictions on human access, when 5 or fewer breeding pairs are established in an experimental population area,
may be required between April 1 and June 30, within 1 mile of active wolf den or rendezvous sites. When 6 or more breeding
pairs are established in an experimental population area, no land use restrictions may be employed outside of National
Parks or National Wildlife Refuges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, import, or export by any means whatsoever, any
wolf or part thereof from the experimental populations taken in violation of these regulations or in violation of
applicable State or Tribal fish and wildlife laws or regulations or the Endangered Species Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or cause to be committed, any offense
defined in paragraphs (&blank;)(2) through (4) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The site for reintroduction is within the historic range of the species:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) [Reserved]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The central Idaho Management area is shown on the attached map. The boundaries of the nonessential experimental
population area will be those portions of Idaho and Montana that are south of Interstate Highway 90 and West of Interstate
Highway 15.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) All wolves found in the wild within the boundaries of this paragraph (&blank;)(6) after the first releases will
be considered nonessential experimental animals. In the conterminous United States, a wolf that is outside an experimental
area (as defined in paragraph (&blank;)(6) of this section) would be considered as endangered (or threatened if in
Minnesota) unless it is marked or otherwise known to be an experimental animal; such a wolf may be captured for examination
and genetic testing by the Service or Service-designated agency. Disposition of the captured animal may take any
of the following courses:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the animal was not involved in conflicts with humans and is determined likely to be an experimental wolf, it will
be returned to the reintroduction area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the animal is determined likely to be an experimental wolf and was involved in conflicts with humans as identified
in the management plan for the closest experimental area it may relocated, placed in captivity, or killed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If the animal is determined not likely to be an experimental animal, it will be managed according to any Service
approved plans for that area or will be marked and released near its point of capture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) If the animal is determined not to be a wild grey wolf or if the Service or agencies designated by the Service determine
the animal shows substantial evidence of recent hybridization with other canids such as domestic dogs or coyotes
or of being an animal raised in captivity, it will be returned to captivity or killed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The reintroduced wolves will be continually monitored during the life of the project, including by the use of radio
telemetry and other remote sensing devices as appropriate. All released animals will be vaccinated against diseases
and parasites prevalent in canids, as appropriate, prior to release and during subsequent handling. Any animal that
is sick, injured, or otherwise in need of special care may be captured by authorized personnel of the Service or Service
designated agencies and given appropriate care. Such an animal will be released back into its respective reintroduction
area as soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral problems make it necessary to return the animal to captivity
or euthanize it.

(8) The status of the experimental population will be reevaluated within the first 5 years after the first year of releases
of wolves to determine future management needs. This review will take into account the reproductive success and movement
patterns of the individuals released in the area, as well as the overall health of the experimental wolves. Once recovery
goals are met for downlisting or delisting the species, a rule will be proposed to address downlisting or delisting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The Service does not intend to reevaluate the ``nonessential experimental'' designation. The Service does not
foresee any likely situation which would result in changing the nonessential experimental status until the gray
wolf is recovered and delisted in the Northern Rocky Mountains according to provisions outlined in the Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to amend the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations by revising Subpart A and
adding a new Subpart J. The proposed regulations govern the approval and administration of tests that may be used to
determine a student's eligibility for assistance under the student financial assistance programs authorized under
Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (Title IV, HEA programs), if that student does not have a high
school diploma or its recognized equivalent. The regulations also propose a passing score for each approved test.
The proposed regulations implement changes made to section 484(d) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended
(HEA) by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 These proposed regulations implement amended section 484(d) of the HEA, Public Law 102&hyph;325. As amended, section
484(d) provides that a student who does not have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent is eligible for
Title IV, HEA program funds only if_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The student takes an independently administered examination and achieves a score specified by the Secretary,
demonstrating that the student has the ability to benefit from the education or training being offered; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The student is determined to have the ability to benefit from the education or training being offered in accordance
with a ``process'' prescribed by the State in which the institution the student is attending is located and that has
been approved by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations were subject to a regulatory negotiation process set forth in section 492 of the HEA. Under
that process, the Secretary convened four regional meetings to obtain public involvement in the development of these
proposed regulations. These meetings were held in San Francisco, Atlanta, New York, and Kansas City. At these meetings,
the Secretary provided attendees with a list of issues that needed to be addressed in these proposed regulations.
A summary of the responses of the attendees is contained in Appendix A to these proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Groups that attended the regional meetings nominated individuals to participate in regulatory negotiations. The
Secretary selected regulation negotiators from the names nominated and chose negotiators to reflect all the groups
that participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, such as students, student financial aid administrators, and various
types of eligible institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 492(b) of the HEA, the Secretary prepared draft proposed regulations and negotiated provisions
of the draft with the negotiators. Two negotiating sessions were held: one in April 1993 and one in June 1993. Generally,
consensus was not reached on any issues in these regulations, consensus being defined as unanimity among all negotiators.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision of postsecondary education and training programs to students who have neither a high school diploma
nor its recognized equivalent has broader dimensions than those covered under section 484(d) of the HEA and this proposed
regulation. Within the systemic education reforms of the Goals 2000 initiative and current efforts to build an effective
school-to-work transition system, the Secretary is investigating long-term strategies to address problems of
opportunity and quality education for this population, and invites public comment and suggestions concerning those
strategies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also invites comment on an alternative approach to implementing the changes in section 484(d) of the
HEA under the 1992 Amendments (PL 102&hyph;325) that would link the ability-to-benefit (ATB) testing system to State
education practice and policy under the ``Goals 2000: Educate America Act'' (PL 103&hyph;227). If adopted by the
Secretary, under this alternative, the Secretary would publish in the final rule a procedure with the following components:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_By a date to be specified, each State would be asked to inform the Secretary of the test (or tests) which the State has
determined best reflect the education goals and standards for high school graduates in its public education system.
By the same specified date, each State would also set the passing score or scores on those tests, and provide the Secretary
with a justification for the passing score in light of the goals and standards for its public high school graduates.
These tests and passing scores would then become the only allowable ATB tests and passing scores for all postsecondary
institutions located and licensed in the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The Secretary could not disapprove the State's determination except in circumstances in which the selection of
tests and determination of passing scores was documented as inappropriate. The State could replace a disapproved
test or reset a passing score under the same terms as above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_By the same specified date, each State would also submit to the Secretary a plan to ensure independent, fair and secure
administration of the selected tests within its borders, including any provisions the State may deem appropriate
for testing students with disabilities and students of limited English proficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The State would inform all institutions licensed by the State and certified and made eligible for Title IV funds by
the Secretary of the approved tests, passing scores, administrative procedures, and special provisions, and indicate
how it intends to enforce its decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Any State that, by the date specified, chooses not to select tests, determine passing scores, and submit plans for
the other aspects of ensuring independent, fair and secure administration of its ability to benefit testing program,
must notify the Secretary of that choice. By not participating, the State would thereby be determining that students
applying for Title IV (HEA) financial aid to attend a school within the State (1) would have to pass a test determined
by the Secretary, according to the procedures specified in this NPRM, or (2) participate in an approved ``State process''
as specified in PL 102&hyph;325 and as described in this NPRM.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary recognizes that students from many States may apply to attend a single school within one State, and that
standards (hence, selection of tests and determination of passing scores) in the States in which the students live
may be different from standards in the State in which the school is located. However, the State in which the school is
located is responsible for licensing that school, and thus should be able to determine under what educational standards
an individual without a high school diploma or GED should be permitted to use Federal funds at that school.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion reflects proposed significant changes to the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations.
Proposed changes are discussed in the order in which they appear in the proposed regulations text. If a provision applies
to more than one section or is included in more than one section, it is discussed the first time it appears with an appropriate
reference to its other appearances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes to make changes in the following areas:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligible student.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary has revised &sect;668.7(a)(3) to implement amended section 484(d) of the HEA. Under current regulations,
a student does not have to document that he or she has a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent. It is currently
sufficient for a student to certify that he or she has such a credential. The Secretary proposes in &sect;668.7(a)(3)(i)
to require a student to document that he or she has such a credential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has proposed special provisions for a student who_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Attended high school in the United States and is unable to obtain a copy of his or her high school diploma or transcript
because the high school from which the student graduated closed and the records are not available through any state
or local education agency; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Attended high school or its equivalent in a foreign country and is unable to obtain a copy of his or her high school
diploma or transcript. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The special procedures for students in the latter category were suggested by one of the negotiators and are an adaptation
of procedures that are currently being used in New York State. The Secretary is requesting public comment on the procedures
for students in the latter category.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also proposed that, if a student transfers from one institution to another, a statement from the
first institution on an academic or financial aid transcript that it has a copy of the transfer student's diploma or
equivalent certificate would satisfy the documentation requirement for the second institution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Secretary's view that the thrust of the amended section 484(d) of the HEA would be thwarted by continuing the
current practice of allowing institutions to accept a student's word that he or she has a high school diploma. Moreover,
the Secretary believes that this basic element of student eligibility should be documented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the regulation negotiation sessions, the majority of the negotiators agreed to this proposed requirement.
The Secretary is requesting public comment on the burden associated with obtaining a copy of a student's high school
diploma for all students receiving Title IV aid. The Secretary also requests comment on the burden of the proposed
requirement that foreign students who cannot obtain a copy of their diploma submit a written statement, indicating
why their diploma cannot be provided, in both English and their native language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart J_Approval of Independently Administered Tests; Specification of Passing Score; Approval of State Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this subpart, the Secretary is proposing procedures and standards that govern the Secretary's approval of tests,
the passing score of each test, the independent administration of those tests, and the approval of State ``processes.''
These proposed procedures differ significantly from current procedures governing test approval, passing scores,
and test administration because the Secretary believes that the current procedures do not adequately evaluate whether
students without a high school diploma or its equivalent should be eligible to receive Title IV, HEA program funds.
The Secretary intends that these new procedures will significantly strengthen that evaluation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special definitions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has proposed to define special terms that are used throughout Subpart J. The proposed definitions are
based on definitions commonly used in other Federal regulations or that are commonly used in the psychometric field.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application for test approval. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A test publisher that wishes the Secretary to approve its test for use under section 484(d) of the HEA must provide sufficient
information to enable the Secretary to determine that the test instrument satisfies standards used by the education
testing industry, and that the test results are scientifically valid. In this section, the Secretary proposes requirements
to meet those twin goals. Standards used by the testing industry include but are not limited to documentation of test
development, evidence of reliability, unambiguous scales, and provisions for test security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 668.144&blank;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Test approval procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has proposed procedures for approving tests. Under these procedures, the Secretary will use experts
in the field of educational testing and assessment to initially evaluate tests and advise the Secretary as to whether
the test meets all the requirements for test approval set forth in Subpart J. If the test submitted for approval is in
a foreign language, to the extent possible, the Secretary will select at least one expert who is also fluent in the language
in which the test is written.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the test does not meet the requirements for test approval, the Secretary will notify the test publisher and provide
to that test publisher the reasons why the test was not approved. The test publisher may request the Secretary to re-evaluate
that test. The test publisher may accompany that re-evaluation request with documents that address the reasons for
the non-approval of the test, or an analysis of why the test met test approval requirements, notwithstanding the Secretary's
decision. The Secretary is requesting public comment on the resubmission process used to evaluate test for approval,
and on what information could be updated to reflect changes rather than resubmitted in full.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Secretary approves a test, the Secretary proposes that the approval period generally would be five years. If
the test publisher wishes to have that test re-approved after five years without interruption, the Secretary proposes
that the test publisher submit the test for re-approval at least six months before its initial approval is scheduled
to lapse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These procedures are designed to ensure that the tests are reviewed objectively and that the test publishers would
have a fair opportunity to appeal the Secretary's decision if necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 668.145&blank;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria for approving tests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be approved, the Secretary proposes that a test must meet all the conditions for test construction provided in the
1985 edition of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
prepared by the joint committee of the American Educational Research Association, the American Psychological Association,
and the National Council on Measurement in Education. With the exception of tests designed for students in English
as a Second Language (ESL) programs, the Secretary proposes that an approved test assess secondary school level basic
verbal and quantitative skills, knowledge, and/or general learned verbal and quantitative abilities. Therefore,
the content of a test must be able to assess those skills, knowledge, and abilities. The test must sample the major content
``domains'' of secondary school level verbal and quantitative skills with a sufficient number of questions to fully
represent each domain. The test questions must also permit meaningful analysis of the performance of students who
are representative of the contemporary population who are beyond the age of compulsory school attendance and either
have or do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent. The proposed standards are generally accepted in the psychometric
community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In establishing the level of education to be assessed, the Secretary considered whether to establish that level at
a particular grade of secondary schools, such as a tenth grade, eleventh grade, or twelfth grade level. However, because
of the tremendous differences in the United States in the grade level at which subjects are taught in secondary schools,
the Secretary determined that it would not be possible to establish such a grade level. Thus, as a general guideline,
test questions have to be understood and should be answerable by students in the ninth grade through twelfth grade.
An approved test would use test items (questions) that are drawn from the general content of secondary school level
basic verbal and quantitative skills, and would adequately sample that content.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not consider a test to be adequate if it assesses only an individual's personality, general level
of intelligence, interest related to vocational preferences, or a single special-aptitude, such as manual dexterity.
The Secretary believes that there is a significant difference between ability to benefit from instruction in an education
or training program and the demonstrable skills necessary to enter an occupation. The Secretary believes that the
ability to process verbal, symbolic, and numerical information is necessary to benefit from instruction from any
education or training program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 668.146&blank;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Passing score. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes to require test publishers to determine a passing score for each test submitted for approval.
The Secretary proposes that the passing score for each test will be one standard deviation below the mean for students
with high school diplomas who have taken the test within three years before the date on which the test is submitted to
the Secretary for approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has proposed this passing score to establish a sense of comparability among the three categories of
students who are eligible to receive Title IV, HEA program funds. These categories include students who have a high
school diploma, students who have the equivalent of that diploma, in most cases a GED, and students who have neither
but can pass a test approved by the Secretary.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that earning a high school diploma or GED certificate should be the primary basis for qualifying
to receive Title IV, HEA program assistance. The Secretary further believes that students who do not have those credentials
and qualify to receive such assistance by taking a test should demonstrate through that test a level of verbal and quantitative
skills at least comparable to the typical range of performance of students in those other two categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To demonstrate this comparability, the Secretary proposes to establish as the passing score for each approved test
one standard deviation below the mean (average) score achieved by students with high school diplomas who have taken
the test within three years before the date on which the test was submitted to the Secretary for approval. (In very broad
terms, the standard deviation describes the typical range of performance around the mean scores on a test.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary acknowledges that during negotiated rulemaking, the Secretary had proposed that the passing score
would be the mean score of high school graduates who have taken the test within three years of the test being submitted
for approval. Many of the regulatory negotiators had indicated that this passing score was too high for comparability
purposes. Accordingly, in view of these comments, for the purpose of this proposed rule, the Secretary has proposed
a lower passing score. The Secretary welcomes specific comments on the appropriate passing score that should be included
in this regulation.

 The Secretary believes that special provisions should be made for both persons with documented disabilities and
students whose native languages are not English. Therefore, the Secretary is proposing that, under certain circumstances,
special testing procedures or instruments can be used for testing persons with disabilities and for testing students
whose native languages are not English. These tests, of course, would have to be independently administered.

Independent Administration of Tests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Secretary has proposed a scheme under which approved tests are administered independent of the institutions
that use the tests and test results to establish the eligibility of their students for Title IV, HEA program assistance.
The Secretary has proposed an interlocking network of agreements between test publishers, test administrators,
and institutions to achieve this result. The Secretary proposes that the test publishers will have primary responsibility
for ensuring that their tests are independently administered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed scheme, a test publisher will give its test directly or offer it through test administrators that
it certifies. The test publisher will certify a test administrator when it determines the test administrator has
the necessary training, knowledge, and skills to give its test and the ability and capacity to keep the test secure
from release or disclosure. The test publisher will not provide its test to institutions or allow test administrators
to provide its test to institutions. The test administrator may give a test only to a student who is attending, or is
scheduled to attend, an institution that is independent of the test administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The test publisher will score the test and provide the student and the student's institution with a notice indicating
whether the student has passed the test and the student's test score. The institution will be able to use the notice
from the test publisher to determine whether the student qualifies as an eligible student for Title IV, HEA program
assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Agreement between the Secretary and a test publisher. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is proposing that if a publisher's test is approved, the test publisher would be required to enter into
an agreement with the Secretary before an institution would be able to use the test to determine the eligibility of
a student for Title IV, HEA program funds. The agreement between the Secretary and the test publisher would articulate
the responsibilities of the test publisher with respect to ensuring the integrity and proper administration of the
test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agreement would provide that the test approved by the Secretary could be given to students only by those test administrators
who are certified by the test publisher. Under the agreement, the test publisher would directly administer its test
or would enter into agreements for test administration with test administrators who it determines are properly trained
and possess the knowledge and skills necessary to test students in accordance with the test publisher's procedures
and instructions. The test publisher would agree to score the test and maintain and make available for the Secretary's
review the records of tests given by the test administrators it certifies. In addition, the test publisher would agree
to provide the Secretary with an analysis of the test scores of tests given by test administrators for the purpose of
determining whether the test scores produced any irregular pattern indicating that the test may not have been properly
administered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the test publisher finds, through an analysis of the test scores or by other means, that a test administrator did
not properly give the test to students or failed to secure the test, the test publisher would be required to decertify
the test administrator. Similarly, the Secretary would terminate the agreement with the test publisher if the test
publisher failed to carry out the terms of the agreement.

Agreement between a test publisher and a test administrator. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except in the case of test administrators at a testing assessment center, the Secretary is proposing that a test publisher
must enter into an agreement with each test administrator it certifies to give its test. Initial and continuing approval
by the Secretary of a publisher's test is subject to this requirement. The agreement would require the test administrator
to be independent from the institution that a student taking the test is attending or is planning to attend. In addition,
the agreement would require the test administrator to give the test in accordance with the test publisher's instructions,
to secure the test properly against disclosure or release, and to submit the original test answer sheet promptly to
the test publisher for grading. The test publisher would have to terminate the agreement with a test administrator
if the test publisher finds that the test administrator violated the provisions of the agreement.

Agreement between the institution and a certified test administrator. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary proposes that if an institution wishes to award Title IV, HEA program funds to a student without a high
school diploma or its recognized equivalent, the institution must enter into a written agreement with a test administrator
who has been certified by a test publisher. The Secretary does not consider that a test administrator has an ownership
interest in an institution if that ownership interest is derived from ownership of a mutual fund whose portfolio included
the stock of the institution or the corporation that owns the institution. In the agreement, the institution would
agree not to interfere with or compromise the independence of the test administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is requesting public comment on the use of the three separate agreements described in &sect;&sect;668.149,
668.150 and 668.151. In commenting on this matter, the Secretary is interested in alternative procedures that would
accomplish the same purpose, independence of test administration, but would require only one or two agreements.

Administration of tests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section summarizes the rules regarding the administration of tests under this subpart. In addition, the Secretary
proposes that if a student fails a test, the student may not retake the same form of that test for the period specified
by the test publisher in the publisher's application that was approved by the Secretary.

Institutional accountability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Secretary's proposed scheme, institutions will not be part of the process of determining whether students
pass approved tests. Therefore, if an institution receives a notice from an approved test publisher that one of its
students received a passing score on an approved test, the institution will not be liable to repay any student financial
assistance funds the student receives if the student, in actuality, did not pass that test. An institution will be
liable only if it used a test administrator that was not independent of the institution, it violated its agreement
with a test administrator, it compromised in any way the testing process, or it was unable to document that the student
received a passing score on an approved test. These rules are intended to ensure that an institution will not compromise
the administration of a test.

Approved State process. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 484(d) of the HEA, a student without a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent may be eligible
to receive Title IV, HEA program funds without passing an independent examination approved by the Secretary if the
student is determined to have the ability to benefit from education or training under a State ``process'' approved
by the Secretary for that purpose. The State process provision was included in the Higher Education Amendments of
1992 as a result of the action taken by the House of Representatives. The activities the Secretary has proposed for
the State process were based upon the description of the State process that was contained in the House Committee Report
of the Committee on Education and Labor which accompanied the House version of what was to become the Higher Education
Amendments of 1992. The Secretary proposes to approve a State process based upon (1) activities that are included
in the process and (2) student outcomes. The proposed rules are designed to ensure that a State process is approved
only if the process is effective in enabling students to benefit from the instruction offered by institutions using
the process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating the passing score on approved tests, the Secretary has proposed to base that passing score on one standard
deviation below the mean for students with high school diplomas who have taken the test within three years before the
date on which the test is submitted to the Secretary for approval. In this way, the Secretary has proposed that recipients
of Title IV, HEA program funds without high school diplomas have a rough comparability with recipients with high school
diplomas. To maintain that comparability under the State process method, the Secretary proposes to approve state
processes if the success rates of students it admits under the State process are within 95 percent of the success rates
of high school graduates who are enrolled in the same educational programs at the institutions that participate in
the State process. A ``success rate'' is a simple measure of the rate at which students complete their programs or are
making progress toward that completion. For this purpose, the Secretary considers that students are making progress
toward the completion of their programs if they are still enrolled in an institution at the end of an award year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens
specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere
in this preamble under the heading 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The small entities that would be affected by these proposed regulations are small institutions
of postsecondary education and test publishers. These regulations would safeguard Federal funds and reduce potential
abuse in the Title IV, HEA programs. These changes will not significantly increase institutions' workloads or costs
associated with administering the Title IV, HEA programs. In the case of test publishers, these businesses are compensated
for any services they provide. Therefore, these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education
will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM contains records that would affect test publishers, postsecondary institutions, and students that do
not have high school diplomas or recognized equivalents and that wish to apply for Title IV, HEA programs. The information
used by test publishers for annual reporting and recordkeeping is readily available in publishers records. An estimate
of the total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden that will result from the collection of the information is
98,375 hours for 196,750 responses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection activity associated with the State process is incorporated in various sections through the regulations.
All other burden associated with the maintenance of records of the student's ability-to-benefit is already cleared
under the individual programs of Federal financial assistance for which these students may be applying under regulations
governing institutions administering these programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) When the Secretary receives a complete application from a test publisher, the Secretary selects experts in
the field of educational testing and assessment to determine whether the test meets the requirements for test approval
contained in &sect;&sect;668.145, 668.146, 668.147, or 668.148, as appropriate, and to advise the Secretary of
their determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the test involves a language other than English, the Secretary selects at least one individual described in
paragraph (a)(1) of this section who is fluent in the language in which the test is written to advise the Secretary on
whether the test meets the additional criteria, provisions, and conditions for test approval contained in &sect;&sect;668.147
and 668.148. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Secretary determines whether the test publisher's test meets the criteria and requirements for approval
after taking the advice of the experts into account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(1) If the Secretary determines that a test does not satisfy the criteria and requirements for test approval, the
Secretary notifies the test publisher of the Secretary's decision, and the reasons why the test did not meet those
criteria and requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The test publisher may request that the Secretary reevaluate the Secretary's decision. Such a request must be
accompanied by_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Documentation and information that addresses the reasons for the non-approval of the test; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An analysis of why the information and documentation submitted meets the criteria and requirements for test
approval notwithstanding the Secretary's decision to the contrary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Secretary approves a test for a period not to exceed five years from the date of the Secretary's written notice
to the test publisher. At least six months before the date on which the test approval is scheduled to lapse, the test
publisher may re-submit the test for review and approval according to the procedures set forth in &sect;668.143.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The approval of a test may be withdrawn if the Secretary determines that the publisher violated any terms of the
agreement described in &sect;668.149, or that the information the publisher submitted as a basis for approval of
the test was inaccurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If the Secretary revokes approval of a previously approved test, the revocation is effective 120 days from the
date the notice of revocation is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) A State that wishes the Secretary to consider its State process as an alternative to achieving a passing score
on an approved, independently administered test for the purpose of determining a student's eligibility for Title
IV, HEA program funds must apply to the Secretary for approval of that process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Secretary approves a State's process if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The State administering the process can demonstrate that the students it admits under that process without a high

and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(4) Assistance in developing educational goals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e)(1) The Secretary responds to a State's request for approval of its State's process within six months after the
Secretary's receipt of that request. If the Secretary does not respond by the end of six months, the State's process
becomes effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An approved State process shall become an effective alternative to determine a student's eligibility for Title
IV, HEA program funds under this subpart six months after the date on which the State submits the process to the Secretary
for approval, if the Secretary approves the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Secretary approves a State process for a period not to exceed five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

was inaccurate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Ability-to-Benefit (ATB)_Summary of Discussions at Regional Meetings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. (a) How should the Secretary specify a passing score? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At three of the regional meetings, it was recommended that tests be normed by different populations for students in
different educational programs. At two of the regional meetings, it was recommended that test scores be those recommended
by test publishers. At one of the regional meetings, it was recommended that test scores should be based on persistence
data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) How should ATB test validity for schools with testing centers located on campus be addressed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This issue was not addressed at any of the regional meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) What criteria should be adopted to determine whether an ATB test is independently administered? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision was only addressed at one of the regional meetings where the consensus was that the current provisions
as outlined in the December 12, 1989 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice are sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. (a) How should the Secretary determine whether a test is independently administered? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consensus at all four of the regional meetings was that the Secretary should (1) continue to require the test examiner
to certify that the test was independently administered, and (2) continue to permit testing centers at a school to
administer tests provided that the testing center is separate from the admissions and financial aid process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) What standards should be established for the development, administration, and scoring of examinations? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This issue was only addressed at two of the regional meetings. The consensus at one of the regional meetings was that
a test should determine both a student's quantitative and verbal skill levels. The consensus at the other regional
meeting was that tests should be reviewed for test biases, such as ethnicity, native language, and disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How often must a state submit ATB plans? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At three of the regional meetings, the consensus was that a state should only have to submit a plan once and then be required
to resubmit it if the process changed. The consensus at the other regional meeting was that a state should have to submit
its plan every 5 years at a minimum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What factors should the Secretary use to evaluate the effectiveness of a state plan? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consensus in all of the regional meetings was that the Secretary should consider such factors as retention, graduation
and placement rates, and other relevant measures in evaluating the effectiveness of a state plan.
