SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is denying a petition for rulemaking (PRM&hyph;50&hyph;53) from Ms. Susan
L. Hiatt on behalf of the Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. (OCRE). The petition requested reopening of the
rulemaking procedure that led to promulgation of 10 CFR 50.62, the ``Anticipated Transient Without Scram'' (ATWS)
rule. The principal basis for the OCRE request was the possibility that the ATWS analyses that formed the underlying
bases of the ATWS rule were invalid because they did not appropriately account for the effects of large power oscillations,
such as those that occurred during the March 9, 1988, instability event at the LaSalle County Nuclear Station (Unit
2). The petition is being denied because the Commission has concluded, based on core stability analyses during hypothetical
ATWS events, and based on recommended procedure changes at nuclear power plants, that large-amplitude power oscillations
will not impact the core and containment response sufficiently to invalidate the assumptions and results of previous
ATWS analyses that were the bases for the ATWS rule. The NRC has carefully considered the issues raised in the petition
and has taken them into account in reaching its decision to deny the petition.

The Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated July 22, 1988, Ms. Susan L. Hiatt, a representative of the Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc.,
requested that the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR), take immediate action with respect to boiling
water reactors (BWRs) to relieve what she alleged to be undue risks to the public health and safety posed by the thermal-hydraulic
instability of BWRs as revealed by an event at LaSalle County Station, Unit 2, on March 9, 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner requested that the NRC conduct a rulemaking procedure under 10 CFR 2.802 to address: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The possibility that the analyses used during the proceedings that promulgated 10 CFR 50.62 (the ``ATWS'' rule)
were invalid because they did not appropriately account for the effect of large power oscillations (those analyses
were the underlying basis for the design requirements established in 10 CFR 50.62 to reduce the risk from ATWS events);
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The appropriateness of the 10 CFR 50.62 requirement for automatic tripping of the recirculation pumps in response
to designated ATWS signals. In light of the potential consequences of large power oscillations, since tripping the
recirculation pumps moves reactor operation into a state with high power-to-flow ratio where oscillations are likely,
the petitioner requested that the pump-tripping requirement be reconsidered.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Staff Action on the Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The staff has been reviewing generic concerns regarding the large power oscillations that were observed during the
March 9, 1988, instability event at the LaSalle County Nuclear Station, Unit 2, since the event's occurrence. That
part of the effort that has focused on developing a response to the OCRE petition has concentrated on developing an
improved understanding of BWR stability phenomena. These staff [and associated Boiling Water Reactor Owner's Group
(BWROG)] efforts have included analytical studies of ATWS scenarios, stability sensitivity studies, and the validation
and verification of the analytical models and codes used for these studies. The primary objective was to determine
if large-amplitude oscillations might impact the core and containment response sufficiently to invalidate the
assumptions and results of previous ATWS analyses that were the bases for the ATWS rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to OCRE's contention that the automatic tripping of the recirculation pumps in response to designated
ATWS signals, as required by the ATWS rule, is inappropriate in light of the potential consequences of large power
oscillations, the staff reviewed the advantages (related to decreased heat load on the containment) and disadvantages
(related to exacerbation of power oscillations) of the requirement that the recirculation pumps be tripped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Reasons for Denial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attachments to the NRC's letter to the petitioner (SECY&hyph;94&hyph;123) includes a detailed presentation
of the bases for the denial of the petition. In summary, a substantial effort was necessary to develop computer codes
to simulate the oscillation behavior of the modeled reactors and to validate and verify these codes to ensure that
they give accurate predictions. On the basis of its review of TRACG code's qualifications for performing power oscillation
analyses, the staff concluded that TRACG can serve as an adequate tool to estimate qualitatively the global behavior
of operating reactors during transients that may result in large power oscillations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although large power oscillations may increase the overheating and severity of fuel damage resulting from an ATWS
event, the analyses indicate that core coolability and containment integrity can be acceptably maintained. Therefore,
the staff concluded that the ATWS analyses that formed the bases of the ATWS rule remain valid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff's review of the advantages and disadvantages of the requirement that the recirculation pumps be tripped
indicated that recirculation pump trip was appropriate and necessary to reduce heat load to the containment following
an ATWS, and that the potentially adverse impact due to large power oscillations could be mitigated by revisions to
the Emergency Procedure Guidelines (EPGs) that were recommended by the BWROG. Revisions to the EPGs are: prompt cessation
of feedwater flow until water level is reduced to about one meter below the feedwater sparger, thus reducing core inlet
subcooling which dampens power oscillations; and earlier injection of boron in the presence of power oscillations,
thus reducing power level, which reduces the adverse consequences of any remaining power oscillations. The staff
concluded that these revisions are sufficient for mitigating the consequences of a bounding ATWS event with large
oscillations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the bases of the above analyses and recommended procedure changes, the staff concludes that, although large power
oscillations may increase the overheating and severity of fuel damage resulting from an ATWS event, core coolability
and containment integrity can be acceptably maintained in a manner consistent with the assumptions and results of
previous ATWS analyses that were the bases for the ATWS rule, and that, therefore, the requirements of the ATWS rule
remain appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because each of the issues raised in the petition has been substantively resolved, the NRC has denied this petition.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In August of 1993, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [``the 1993 NPRM''] seeking comment on
proposed rules governing the conversion of campaign funds to personal use [``the proposed rules'']. 58 FR 45463 (August
30, 1993). The proposed rules were drafted to implement section 439a of the Federal Election Campaign Act, 2 U.S.C.
431 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
[``FECA'']. Section 439a says that no amounts received by a candidate as contributions that are in excess of any amount
necessary to defray his or her expenditures may be converted by any person to any personal use, other than to defray
any ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with his or her duties as a holder of Federal office. Those
who wished to comment on the proposed rules were invited to do so by September 29, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission subsequently granted a request for a 45 day extension of the comment period, giving the regulated community
until November 13, 1993 to submit their views on the proposed rules. 58 FR 52040 (Oct. 6, 1993). The Commission received
32 comments from 31 commenters in response to the 1993 NPRM. The Commission also held a public hearing on January 12,
1994, at which it heard testimony from five witnesses on the proposed rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 19, 1994, the Commission held an open meeting at which it considered draft final rules on the conversion of campaign
funds to personal use. The Commission also discussed several letters it had received at the time of the meeting requesting
an additional opportunity to comment on the rules before they are finally promulgated. These requests correctly
noted that, in an effort to address the concerns of the commenters, the draft final rules adopted a different approach
to defining personal use than the proposed rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission notes that the 1993 NPRM sought comments on all of the areas addressed by the draft final rules. Thus,
under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
it would be appropriate for the Commission to proceed to adopt final rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the Commission has decided to provide an additional opportunity to comment on the rules before they
are finally promulgated. The Commission has revised the rules and is publishing the revised version [referred to
as ``the revised rules''] in this NPRM in order to invite comments from the regulated community. Although this additional
comment period will delay completion of the personal use rules, the Commission still intends to finalize rules this
year. The Commission will maintan a schedule that will allow the rules to go into effect early in the next election cycle.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Revised Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised rules would include a general definition of personal use and several enumerated examples. Section 113.1(g)(1)
would indicate that, generally, personal use would be any use of funds that confers a benefit on a candidate or a member
of the candidate's family that is not related to the campaign or the ordinary and necessary duties of a holder of Federal
office. Section 113.1(g)(1)(i) contains examples of uses that would be personal use if they confer the kind of benefit
described in the general definition. The list of examples includes mortgage, rent and utility payments, certain
vehicle expenses, household food items, clothing, tuition, and funeral expenses. The list also includes salary
payments to family members in excess of fair market value, legal expenses, certain travel and meal expenses, country
club dues and entertainment. In addition, the revised rules would specifically indicate that the use of funds to pay
the candidate a salary would be personal use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 113.1(g)(1)(iii) of the revised rules would indicate that the Commission will use the general definition
to determine, on a case by case basis, whether other uses of campaign funds are personal use. The revised rules would
also indicate that the Commission may determine that a use of funds that confers a benefit on someone other than the
candidate or the candidate's family members is personal use if the benefit is not campaign or officeholder related.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revised &sect;113.1(g)(2) would indicate that charitable donations are not personal use unless the candidate making
the donation receives compensation from the recipient organization before the organization has used the funds donated
for other purposes. Under revised &sect;113.1(g)(3), transfers of campaign committee assets to the candidate would
not be personal use so long as the committee receives adequate consideration. Revised &sect;113.1(g)(3) also contains
provisions that would ensure that the cost of the asset being transferred is properly allocated between the committee
and the candidate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;113.1(g)(4) of the revised rules, the use of funds for an expense that would be considered a political
expense under House rules or an officially connected expense under Senate rules would not be personal use to the extent
that the expense qualifies as an expenditure under 11 CFR 100.8 or is an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in
connection with the duties of a Federal officeholder. The Commission anticipates that, in most circumstances, political
and officially connected expenses will be ordinary and necessary expenses of a Federal officeholder for purposes
of the FECA, rather than conversions to personal use. However, section 439a of the FECA uses different standards than
House and Senate rules for determining whether a particular use of campaign funds is permissible. Specifically,
the Commission would not consider any use of funds that would be personal use under &sect;113.1(g)(1) to be an ordinary
and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a Federal officeholder under the FECA. Thus, the Commission
will have to determine whether political of officially connected expenses are personal use on a case-by-case basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed section 113.1(g)(5) of the revised rules would indicate that payments for expenses that would be personal
use under paragraph (g)(1) of this section will generally be considered contributions to the candidate if made by
a third party. Consequently, the amount donated or expended will count towards the third party's contribution limits.
However, no contribution would result if the payment is a donation to a legal expense trust fund, if the funds used were
the candidate's personal funds, if the payment was made by a member of the candidate's family from an account jointly
held with the candidate, or if the payment would have been made irrespective of the candidacy and such payments were
made before the candidate became a candidate. Section 113.1(g)(6) would list the members of the candidate's family
for the purposes of &sect;113.1(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also proposing an amendment to the list of permissible uses of excess campaign funds contained in
11 CFR 113.2. The amendment would specifically indicate that certain travel costs and certain office operating expenditures
would be considered ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the duties of a Federal officeholder
under the FECA. It would also specifically indicate that any use of funds that would be personal use under 11 CFR 113.1(g)(1)
is not an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a Federal officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice also contains a proposed conforming amendment to the definition of expenditure contained in section 100.8(b)(22).
Consistent with revised &sect;113.1(g)(5), this amendment would clarify that payment of the candidate's personal
living expenses by a member of the candidate's family will not be considered expenditures if they are made from an account
jointly held with the candidate or were paid by the family member before the candidate became a candidate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the comments on the proposed rules set out below, the Commission is interested in receiving comments
on whether additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements would be useful in administering section 439a.
Several of the commenters that responded to the 1993 NPRM expressed the view that additional reporting requirements
would be helpful in this area. However, it is difficult to craft a rule that would be both useful in enforcing the personal
use ban and not overly burdensome on the reporting committees. The Commission invites commenters to suggest ways
in which the reporting requirements could be amended to achieve this goal. Comments are also welcome on the alternative
of requiring committees to keep additional records to serve this purpose, without requiring additional reporting.
Commenters are encouraged to focus on how these amendments could be crafted to be both useful and not overly burdensome.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission notes that Internal Revenue Service regulations under 26 U.S.C. 527 contain a definition of personal
use by political organizations. 26 CFR 1.527&hyph;5(a)(1). However, the IRS definition is not controlling in this
situation, and is not necessarily coextensive with the proposed rule. The Commission welcomes comments on the revised
rules, and on any other issues raised by this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of campaign funds for an expense that would be a political expense under the rules of the United States House
of Representatives or an officially connected expense under the rules of the United States Senate is not personal
use to the extent that the expense is an expenditure under 11 CFR 100.8 or an ordinary and necessary expense incurred
in connection with the duties of a holder of Federal office. Any use of funds that would be personal use under 11 CFR 113.1(g)(1)
will not be considered an expenditure under 11 CFR 100.8 or an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection
with the duties of a holder of Federal office.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notwithstanding that the use of funds for a particular expense would be a personal use under paragraph (g)(1) of this
section, payment of that expense by any person other than the candidate or the campaign committee shall be a contribution
to the candidate unless_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The payment is a donation to a legal expense trust fund established in accordance with the rules of the United States
Senate or the United States House of Representatives; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The payment is made from funds that are the candidate's personal funds as defined in 11 CFR 110.10(b), including
an account jointly held by the candidate and a member of the candidate's family; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The payment would have been made irrespective of the candidacy and payments for that expense were made by the
person making the payment before the candidate became a candidate. Payments that are compensation shall be considered
contributions unless_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The compensation results from bona fide employment that is genuinely independent of the candidacy; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The compensation is exclusively in consideration of services provided by the employee as part of this bona fide
independent employment; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The compensation does not exceed the amount of compensation which would be paid to any other similarly qualified
person for the same work over the same period of time.

spouse; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The use of funds for the costs of winding down the office of a former Federal officeholder for a period not to exceed

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Short Brothers
Model SD3&hyph;60 series airplanes. This proposal would require installation of a certain time delay relay and associated
wiring into a circuit of the rudder gust lock. This proposal is prompted by reports of inadvertent engagements of the
rudder gust lock on in-service Model SD3&hyph;60 series airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended
to prevent premature locking of the rudder gust lock, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane
in flight and during landing roll.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Short Brothers Model SD3&hyph;60 series airplanes. The CAA advises
that it has received reports of inadvertent engagements of the rudder gust lock on in-service Model SD3&hyph;60 series
airplanes. Investigation revealed that these inadvertent engagements were caused by premature locking of the rudder
gust lock system. Premature locking of the rudder gust lock, if not corrected, could result in reduced controllability
of the airplane in flight and during landing roll. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Short Brothers has issued Shorts Service Bulletin SD360&hyph;27&hyph;23, Revision 1, dated April 15, 1994, which
describes procedures for installation of a 10-second time delay relay, having part number TDD&hyph;AYOF&hyph;1002,
and associated wiring into a circuit of the rudder gust lock. Such an installation safeguards against inadvertent
locking of the rudder gust lock until the airplane can reach a ground speed at which the nose wheel steering can be used.
The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness Directive 013&hyph;02&hyph;94,
dated March 24, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated
for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require installation of a certain 10-second time delay
relay and associated wiring into a circuit of the rudder gust lock. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 88 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
29 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $140,360, or $1,595 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is proposing for comment rule and form amendments relating to the reporting of expenses by investment
companies. The proposed amendments would require an investment company to reflect as expenses in its statement of
operations certain liabilities of the company paid by broker-dealers in connection with the allocation of the company's
brokerage transactions to the broker-dealers. The amendments would also require an investment company to include
expenses paid in this manner in the fee table and financial highlights table appearing in the company's prospectus,
and in calculating the company's yield. The amendments are designed to enhance the information provided to investors
so that they may be better able to assess and compare investment company expenses and performance.

Executive Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing to amend rule 6&hyph;07 of Regulation S&hyph;X, the regulation setting forth form and
content requirements for financial statements included in registration statements, proxy statements, annual
reports, and shareholder reports under the various securities laws. The amendments would require a registered investment
company (``fund'') to adjust the amount of expenses reflected in the statement of operations in its financial statements
to include amounts the fund would have paid to its service providers had a broker-dealer or any affiliate of the broker-dealer
not paid or agreed to pay those service providers on behalf of the fund in connection with the allocation of fund transactions
to the broker-dealer. The Commission is also proposing amendments to various fund registration forms to require
that the adjusted expenses be reflected in the fee table and financial highlights table included in fund prospectuses,
in the yield quotation required in fund Statements of Additional Information, and, as a result, in yield quotations
in fund advertisements and sales literature. Finally, the Commission is proposing to require that the financial
highlights table disclose the average commission rate paid by the fund.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some investment companies recently have entered into arrangements under which a broker-dealer agrees to pay the
cost of certain products or services provided to the investment company in exchange for fund brokerage (``brokerage/service
arrangements''). Under a typical brokerage/service arrangement, a broker agrees to pay a fund's custodian fees
or transfer agency fees and, in exchange, the fund agrees to direct a minimum amount of brokerage to the broker. The
fund usually negotiates the terms of the contract with the service provider, who is paid directly by the broker.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Brokerage/service arrangements are structurally similar to the more common research soft-dollar arrangements
by which an investment adviser uses client commission dollars to obtain research services. In a research soft-dollar
arrangement, however, the receipt of a benefit by an adviser through the use of its clients' commission dollars raises
conflict of interest concerns addressed by the safe harbor provisions of section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``1934 Act''). These concerns generally are not raised by brokerage/service arrangements, which typically
involve the use of a fund's commission dollars to obtain services that directly and exclusively benefit the fund.
Nevertheless, a fund's investment adviser can benefit from these brokerage/service arrangements, particularly
if a reduction in fund expenses affects the amount of any expense waiver or reimbursement by the adviser. The receipt
by a fund's adviser of any direct or indirect economic benefit as the result of these arrangements would almost certainly
violate section 17(e)(1) of the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;17(e)(1)], unless the benefit received fell within
the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e).

By entering into a brokerage/service arrangement, a fund can reduce expenses reported to shareholders in its statement
of operations, fee table, and its expense ratio and can increase its reported yield.

 This is because the costs paid on behalf of the fund by the broker are embedded in the brokerage commissions the fund
pays.

 In substance, however, a brokerage/service arrangement involves a rebate on brokerage commissions which, if paid
in cash to the fund, would not reduce fund expenses.

A fund is currently required to disclose in footnotes to its fee table, financial highlights table, and financial
statements its participation in brokerage/service arrangements and the effect the arrangements may have on the
level of brokerage commissions paid by the fund. To the extent practicable, a fund must also quantify in these footnotes
the effect of brokerage/service arrangements on fund expenses. This footnote disclosure would no longer be necessary
if the amendments are adopted.

The safe harbor provided by section 28(e) of the 1934 Act does not encompass soft dollar arrangements under which research
services are acquired as a result of principal transactions, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
when a broker buys or sells securities for or from its own account. U.S. Department of Labor (pub. avail. July 25, 1990).
Because, as discussed at note 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
supra 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
and accompanying text, brokerage/service arrangements do not fall under the Section 28(e) safe harbor, a fund may

Therefore, references in this release to ``commissions'' or ``commission dollars'' rather than ``spreads'' or

As a result of the current accounting treatment of brokerage/service arrangements, investors may not be able to evaluate
fully the expenses of a fund that pays for services with commission dollars and accurately compare expenses and yields
among funds. This lack of comparability is particularly significant considering the wide use of fund expense data
by investors.

Brokerage/service arrangements may benefit funds (and their shareholders) by reducing overall fund costs and increasing
total return,

 The receipt of a net benefit by a fund does not, however, alter the substance of the services provided under these arrangements.
The services provided are generally wholly distinct from the execution of securities transactions, and their reflection
as capital costs can distort fund financial information.

Under the proposed amendments, the total of the itemized expenses in the statement of operations, including the expenses
paid with commission dollars, would be shown as the fund's ``total expenses.'' As discussed below, the total expense
figure also would be used in determining the fund's expense ratio, its ``Other Expenses'' listed in the fee table,
and its yield. The total expenses would be reduced by the total amount paid with commission dollars and the remainder
shown on the statement of operations as ``net expenses.''

The additional ``cost'' reflected on the statement of operations would be the amount that the fund would have paid
for the services if commission dollars had not been used. If a fund negotiates the service provider's fees directly
with the service provider, the cost of the services for purposes of making the required adjustments would be the amount
negotiated, presumably the same amount the fund would have paid for the service in the absence of the arrangement.
When the broker arranges for the services or provides them itself or through an affiliate, however, the actual cost
of the services may not be readily determinable by the fund. In this case, the proposed amendments would require that
the fund reflect in its financial statements an amount determined by making a good-faith estimate of the amount the
fund would have paid had it contracted for the services directly in an arms-length transaction.

individually less than five percent of the unadjusted expense could be aggregated. The total of these amounts, which
should equal the amount of the ``Fees Paid with Commission Dollars'' line item, also would be required to be stated

The amendments would specifically except research services, as that term is used in section 28(e) of the 1934 Act,
from the services the cost of which must be reflected as expenses.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 The cost of research ``purchased'' by an adviser with fund commission dollars could also be considered an expense
of the fund which is not reflected as an expense in the statement of operations and other financial information. The
Commission is concerned that the adoption of these disclosure rules might lead some funds to discontinue brokerage/service
arrangements and purchase more research through traditional soft dollar arrangements, which, under these proposals,
would not be required to be treated as an expense. Comment is requested whether these proposals would have this effect.

Because research services are typically provided to the adviser, not the fund, the specific exception may be unnecessary.
However, in light of the widespread use of research soft-dollar arrangements, the Commission is proposing a specific
exception.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is studying whether the cost of research services provided by brokers should be reflected as fund expenses
and requests comment on this issue.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 Commenters favoring inclusion of research services in the amendments should address how such services should be
valued and how the value of the services should be allocated among clients of the adviser that may benefit from them.
If research services cannot be valued, should the Commission require that assumptions be made about their value by
extrapolation from the brokerage commissions paid? For example, should the difference between a brokerage commission
paid on a transaction and the lowest commission paid by the fund be considered a fund expense for research? Alternatively,
should the Commission require only that the values of research services that have readily ascertainable values be
quantified, such as subscriptions to newspapers, price quotation or valuation services, or research that is received
in return for the direction of a determinable amount of brokerage?

2. An Alternative Accounting Method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative to the accounting changes being proposed, funds could be required to allocate each commission paid
between execution cost and payment for fund services and to present their financial statements based upon those allocations.
This method would require separating commissions into brokerage and expense components, and reflecting the expense
component as an expense in the financial statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The allocation method would assess the actual economic character of a fund's brokerage commissions and adjust all
fund financial information to reflect this assessment. Under the allocation method, the portion of a commission
properly allocated to expenses would have to be estimated and may need to be adjusted as the total amount of commission
dollars paid to the broker increases.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 This adjustment, in turn, would require that the cost bases and sales prices of particular securities be adjusted
periodically based upon the transactions directed to a particular broker. Therefore, using the allocation method
to account for expenses paid with commission dollars could prove to be costly and lead to undesirable uncertainties
in accounting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing to amend instructions to the items of the fund registration forms that require funds to
include in their prospectuses a table presenting the expenses paid by fund shareholders, either directly or out of
the assets of the fund (the ``fee table'').
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 The amended instructions would require that the expense percentages included in a fund's fee table be based upon total
expenses (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that the percentages include amounts paid with commission dollars).
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, the amendments would revise Form N&hyph;1A and Form N&hyph;2 to require that the ``ratio of expenses to
average net assets'' in a fund's ``financial highlights'' table reflect expenses paid with commission dollars.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 The fee table and financial highlights table are required to be placed prominently in the prospectus, and are intended
to be the primary means for the communication of fund expenses and performance to shareholders and prospective shareholders.

the extent an expense is waived or reimbursed.

table for fiscal years ending before the adoption of the amendments.

If these proposals are adopted, the Commission may require funds to present the grossed-up expense information in
statements of operations and financial highlights tables for the entire fiscal period ending on or after the date
of adoption. Because funds ordinarily would maintain records related to these arrangements, this should not be burdensome.
Comment is requested whether reflecting total expenses for the period beginning before adoption of the rule would
be burdensome.

C. Performance Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commission rules require that any quotation of yield in a mutual fund advertisement be calculated in accordance with
a formula that reflects fund expenses accrued for the period.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Use of total expenses in the calculation of a fund's yield may be appropriate to reflect actual fund expenses and necessary
to maintain the value of yield as an indicator of fund performance.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, the Commission is proposing instructions to the yield formulas for funds (other than money market funds)
to require that the costs of services paid for with brokerage commissions be reflected in quotations of yield in a fund's
registration statement, and, as a result, in its advertisements.

Paragraph (e)(1) of rule 482 under the 1933 Act [17 CFR 230.482(e)(1)] requires that yield quotations included in
fund advertisements be calculated in accordance with the formulas specified in fund registration forms. The yield
formulas are set forth in Item 22(b)(ii) of Form N&hyph;1A, Item 25(b)(ii) of Form N&hyph;3, and Item 21(b)(ii) of
Form N&hyph;4.

As discussed 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
supra 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
at note 4, the characterization of costs as expenses or capital items does not affect a fund's total return, and, therefore,
no amendment to the total return formula is being proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, the proposed amendments to Regulation S&hyph;X would require that adjustments to fund expenses
be made at the end of a financial statement period.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 Those amendments generally would not require funds to accrue or otherwise determine at the end of the thirty-day period
for which yield is calculated the amount of expenses paid with brokerage commissions for that period. The proposed
instructions to the yield formulas, therefore, would require funds to estimate amounts paid with commission dollars
for the period of the yield quotation. Comment is requested on the feasibility of making such an estimate and whether
there are alternative approaches.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposals would not revise the manner in which yield is calculated by money market funds. The money market fund
yield formula is based upon the net change in the value of a hypothetical account, and any spread or mark-up paid by a
fund would be amortized and reflected in that change in value.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, requiring money market funds to include fees paid with commission dollars in the calculation of yield
would result in those fees being counted twice.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 Comment is specifically requested whether the money market fund yield formula should be revised to reflect the cost
of services paid for with commission dollars as expenses when they are incurred. Commenters should discuss the extent
to which money market funds pay or can pay expenses through brokerage/service arrangements, and commenters suggesting
revisions to the yield calculation should provide specific text or formulas.

The same double-counting problem does not arise with respect to non-money market funds because the yield formula
for those funds generally requires that the amortization of premium and accretion of discount on debt securities
be based upon the market value of the security, rather than the initial purchase price. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Instruction 1(a) to Item 22(b)(ii) of Form N&hyph;1A. The mark-up or spread paid by the fund upon the purchase of a security
is not reflected in the security's market value and therefore would not be a part of any premium amortized or discount
accreted for the purposes of calculating yield.

D. Related Arrangements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is aware that funds enter into certain other arrangements that, like brokerage/service arrangements,
have the effect of reducing reported fund expenses. Some funds, for example, have ``compensating balance'' arrangements
with their custodians under which their custodian fees are reduced if they maintain cash on deposit with the custodians
in non-interest bearing accounts. In these arrangements expenses are reduced by forgoing income rather than by recharacterizing
them as capital items. The Commission requests comment whether an adjustment to fund expenses similar to that being
proposed for brokerage/service arrangements should be required for these expense offset arrangements, or whether
these arrangements should be addressed in footnotes to the financial statements. Because a fund that enters into
these arrangements forgoes income, comment also is requested whether such income should be estimated and reflected
in fund financial information, and how such estimates might be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some custodial arrangements may involve explicit oral or written understandings regarding the fee reductions that
will occur when uninvested cash balances exceed predetermined levels. Often, however, a fund's custodian fee reflects
an estimate of the income the custodian expects to derive from the fund's uninvested cash balances, and the resulting
reduction in the fee is not explicitly disclosed in the custodial agreement. The Commission requests comment whether
the amount of any increase in fund expenses to reflect these arrangements should include only amounts that are explicit
in the agreements, or should also include amounts implicit in the basic custodian fee.

E. Average Commission Rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Brokerage commissions and other costs incurred in connection with the execution of a fund's portfolio transactions
are not reflected in the fund's statement of operations, financial highlights table or fee table because these costs
are treated as capital items which increase the cost of securities purchased or reduce the proceeds of securities
sold. The Commission is concerned that adequate information about these costs currently may not be provided to investors.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission, therefore, is proposing to require that the average commission rate paid by a fund (in cents per share)
be disclosed in the financial highlights table next to the portfolio turnover rate.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 Other fund transaction costs, such as mark-ups, mark-downs, and spreads, would not be included in this commission
rate figure. Comment is requested whether these other costs should be reflected, and, if so, how they should be calculated
or estimated.

Any interested persons wishing to submit written comments on the rule and form changes that are the subject of this
Release, to suggest additional changes, or to submit comments on other matters that might have an effect on the proposals

The rule and form changes proposed today are intended to improve the reporting of investment company expenses and
improve the ability of investors to compare investment company expenses and performance. While the rule and form
changes may increase the costs to funds of preparing financial statements and fund registration materials, the Commission
believes that any such cost increases would, at most, be minimal. A fund that has brokerage/service arrangements
would be required to add two captions and a footnote to its statement of operations and replace the net expense figures
currently disclosed in its fee table and financial highlights table with total expense figures. These figures will
normally be readily determinable by the fund. Funds should also be able to readily estimate expenses paid with brokerage
commissions for purposes of yield calculations. In short, the Commission believes that the costs of the amendments
proposed today would be substantially outweighed by the benefits to investors of receiving more accurate and useful
financial information about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds.

The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 regarding
the proposed amendments. The analysis notes that the rule and form proposals contained in this Release are intended
to provide for the comparability of fund expenses reflected in fund disclosure documents and advertisements. Other
aggregate cost-benefit information reflected in the ``Cost/Benefit Analysis'' section of this release also is
reflected in the analysis. A copy of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis may be obtained by contacting Eric
C. Freed, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Mail Stop 10&hyph;6, Washington, DC 20549.

1994 (58 FR 28821, 28822), FDA issued two documents entitled ``Review of General Biologics and Licensing Regulations''
(Docket No. 94N&hyph;0066) and ``Review of Regulations for Blood Establishments and Blood Products'' (Docket No.
94N&hyph;0080). Interested persons were given until August 17, 1994, to respond to the documents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The American Blood Resources Association has requested a 90-day extension of the comment periods for the two above
mentioned documents. The Biotechnology Industry Organization and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
of America have requested a 60-day extension for the general biologics and licensing regulations document. In order
to allow interested persons to fully respond to the requests for comments, FDA believes it is in the public interest
to extend the comment period to allow interested persons to carefully review the regulations and submit written comments.
Therefore, FDA is granting the request by extending the comment periods for both documents to November 15, 1994. Interested
persons may, on or before November 15, 1994, submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (address above).
Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified
with the appropriate docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen
in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 19, 1994, MSHA published a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 26356) revising stayed provisions of MSHA's existing safety standards for ventilation of underground coal
mines. The proposal also revised, clarified or reproposed certain other provisions in the existing rule; included
some new provisions; and addressed concerns raised by the public. The comment period was scheduled to close on July
18, 1994, but, in response to a request from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mining community for additional time in which to prepare comments, MSHA extended the comment period to August 8, 1994
(59 FR 35071). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the hearings is to receive relevant comments and to answer questions interpreting or clarifying the
proposal. The hearings will be conducted in an informal manner by a panel of MSHA officials. Although formal rules
of evidence or cross examination will not apply, the presiding official may exercise discretion to ensure the orderly
progress of the hearings and may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious material and questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each session will begin with an opening statement from MSHA, followed by an opportunity for members of the public to
make oral presentations. The hearing panel will be available to address relevant questions. At the discretion of
the presiding official, the time allocated to speakers for their presentations may be limited. In the interest of
conducting productive hearings, MSHA will schedule speakers in a manner that allows all points of view to be heard
as effectively as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Verbatim transcripts of the proceedings will be prepared and made a part of the rulemaking record. Copies of the hearing
transcripts will be made available to the public for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA will also accept for the record additional written comments and other appropriate data from any interested party,
including those not presenting oral statements. Written comments and data submitted to MSHA will be included in the
rulemaking record. To allow for the submission of any post-hearing comments the record will remain open until November
18, 1994.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the District of Columbia for the
purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program. In the final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this
as a noncontroversial SIP revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is
set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further
activity is contemplated and the direct final rule will become effective. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct
final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on
this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting
on this action should do so at this time.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to update a portion of the Outer Continental Shelf (``OCS'') Air Regulations. Requirements applying
to OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries must be updated periodically to remain consistent
with the requirements of the corresponding onshore area (``COA''), as mandated by section 328(a)(1) of the Clean
Air Act (``the Act''), the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The portion of the OCS air regulations that is being updated
pertains to the requirements for OCS sources for which the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (Santa
Barbara County APCD) and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (Ventura County APCD) are the designated
COAs, and a requirement submitted by the state of California. The OCS requirements for the above Districts and the
state of California, contained in the Technical Support Document, are proposed to be incorporated by reference into
the Code of Federal Regulations and are listed in the appendix to the OCS air regulations. Proposed changes to the existing
requirements are discussed below.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 4, 1992, EPA promulgated 40 CFR part 55,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 which established requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources in order to attain and maintain federal
and state ambient air quality standards and to comply with the provisions of part C of title I of the Act. Part 55 applies
to all OCS sources offshore of the States except those located in the Gulf of Mexico west of 87.5 degrees longitude.
Section 328 of the Act requires that for such sources located within 25 miles of a state's seaward boundary, the requirements
shall be the same as would be applicable if the sources were located in the COA. Because the OCS requirements are based
on onshore requirements, and onshore requirements may change, section 328(a)(1) requires that EPA update the OCS
requirements as necessary to maintain consistency with onshore requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The reader may refer to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, December 5, 1991 (56 FR 63774), and the preamble to the final
rule promulgated September 4, 1992 (57 FR 40792) for further background and information on the OCS regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to &sect;55.12 of the OCS rule, consistency reviews will occur: (1) At least annually; (2) upon receipt of
a Notice of Intent (NOI) under &sect;55.4; and (3) when a state or local agency submits a rule to EPA to be considered
for incorporation by reference in part 55. This NPRM is being promulgated in response to the submittal of rules by two
local air pollution control agencies and one rule submitted by the state of California. Public comments received
in writing within 30 days of publication of this notice will be considered by EPA before promulgation of the final updated
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 328(a) of the Act requires that EPA establish requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources located
within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries that are the same as onshore requirements. To comply with this statutory
mandate, EPA must incorporate applicable onshore rules into part 55 as they exist onshore. This limits EPA's flexibility
in deciding which requirements will be incorporated into part 55 and prevents EPA from making substantive changes
to the requirements it incorporates. As a result, EPA may be incorporating rules into part 55 that do not conform to
all of EPA's state implementation plan (SIP) guidance or certain requirements of the Act. Consistency updates may
result in the inclusion of state or local rules or regulations into part 55, even though the same rules may ultimately
be disapproved for inclusion as part of the SIP. Inclusion in the OCS rule does not imply that a rule meets the requirements
of the Act for SIP approval, nor does it imply that the rule will be approved by EPA for inclusion in the SIP.

EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In updating 40 CFR part 55, EPA reviewed the state and local rules submitted for inclusion in part 55 to ensure that they
are rationally related to the attainment or maintenance of federal or state ambient air quality standards or part
C of title I of the Act, that they are not designed expressly to prevent exploration and development of the OCS and that
they are applicable to OCS sources. 40 CFR 55.1. EPA has also evaluated the rules to ensure they are not arbitrary or
capricious. 40 CFR 55.12 (e). In addition, EPA has excluded administrative or procedural rules.

Upon delegation the onshore area will use its administrative and procedural rules as onshore. In those instances
where EPA does not delegate authority to implement and enforce part 55, EPA will use its own administrative and procedural
requirements to implement the substantive requirements. 40 CFR 55.14(c)(4).

A. As stated in the California Health and Safety Code, the following requirements shall be statewide, and no rule or
regulation of any district that is applicable to sandblasting operations shall be stricter or less strict than the
standards adopted by the state board pursuant to the recommendations of the committee appointed by the state board
to adopt air pollution standards for sandblasting operations. After review of the rule submitted by the State of California
against the criteria set forth above and in 40 CFR part 55, EPA is proposing to make the state abrasive sandblasting
requirements applicable to OCS sources:

D. Regulatory Flexibility Act_The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each federal agency to perform a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities.'' Small entities include small businesses, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations, and governmental jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was stated in the final regulation, the OCS rule does not apply to any small entities, and the structure of the rule
averts direct impacts and mitigates indirect impacts on small entities. This consistency update merely incorporates
onshore requirements into the OCS rule to maintain consistency with onshore regulations as required by section 328
of the Act and does not alter the structure of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA certifies that this notice of proposed rulemaking will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Paperwork Reduction Act_The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements
contained in the final OCS rulemaking dated September 4, 1992 under the provisions of the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The USEPA proposes to redesignate Oshkosh, Wisconsin from unclassifiable to attainment status for carbon monoxide.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the USEPA is approving the redesignation as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this
as a noncontroversial redesignation and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval
is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to the direct final rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If the USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final
rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting
on this document should do so at this time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is announcing a three-month stay and reconsideration of certain federal rules requiring the repair of leaks
in industrial process equipment promulgated as part of the National Refrigerant Recycling Program. That action
stays the effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), including the applicable compliance dates, as they apply to industrial
process refrigeration equipment only. EPA is issuing that stay pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42
U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), which provides the Administrator authority to stay the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes, pursuant to Clean Air Act sections 301(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), to stay temporarily the
effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), and applicable compliance dates, beyond the three months expressly provided

, EPA announces that pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), it is convening a proceeding
for reconsideration of certain federal rules requiring the repair of leaks of ozone-depleting substances for industrial
process refrigeration equipment promulgated as part of the National Refrigerant Recycling Program (58

28660, May 14, 1993). Readers should refer to that notice for a complete discussion of the background and rules affected.
In that document EPA also announces a three-month stay of &sect;82.156(i) as it applies to industrial process refrigeration
equipment only, and any applicable compliance dates, during reconsideration (including appropriate regulatory
action) expressly provided by the Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B). If EPA does not complete the reconsideration
during the three-month stay, then it may be appropriate to extend the stay of these provisions for industrial process
refrigeration and applicable compliance dates until EPA completes final rulemaking action upon reconsideration.
By this action, EPA proposes a temporary extension of the stay beyond the three months to the extent necessary to complete
reconsideration of the rules in question. If EPA takes final action to impose this proposed stay, the stay would extend
until the effective date of EPA's final action following reconsideration of these rules.

By this notice EPA hereby proposes, pursuant to Clean Air Act sections 301(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), a temporary
administrative stay of the effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i) as it applies to industrial process refrigeration equipment,
including the applicable compliance dates, promulgated as final federal rules requiring the repair and/or retrofitting
of equipment containing ozone-depleting refrigerants (58

28660, May 14, 1993). Pursuant to the rulemaking procedures set forth in section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, EPA hereby
requests comment on such a proposed stay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing this temporary administrative stay of the rules and associated compliance dates in order to complete
reconsideration of these rules, EPA intends to complete its reconsideration of the rules and, following the notice
and comment procedures of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, take appropriate action. If the reconsideration results
in repair and retrofit requirements for industrial process refrigeration equipment that are stricter than the existing
and rules, EPA intends to propose an appropriate compliance period from the date of final action on reconsideration.
EPA will seek to ensure that the affected parties are not unduly prejudiced by the Agency's reconsideration. Any EPA
proposal regarding changes to the leak repair requirements and the appropriate compliance period would be subject
to the notice and comment procedures of Clean Air Act section 307(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 FRA proposes to establish a Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990
and the Federal Advisory Committee Act to develop a recommended rule concerning the protection of railroad roadway
workers. The Committee would adopt its recommendations through a negotiation process. The Committee would be composed
of persons who represent the interests affected by the rule, such as labor organizations, railroads, railroad associations,
contractor associations, and the government. FRA invites interested parties to submit nominations and applications
for membership on the Committee.

(A) History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act, Pub.L. No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
102&hyph;365, 106 Stat. 972, enacted September 3, 1992, required FRA to review its track safety standards and revise
them based on data presented during that review. Among the topics to be addressed was ``an evaluation of employee safety.''
FRA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54038) to announce the opening
of a proceeding to amend the Federal Track Safety Standards (49 CFR Part 213). That ANPRM addressed the general topics
to be considered, including standards for railroad track itself, and protecting maintenance-of-way and other non-operating
railroad employees from the hazards of moving railroad equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of that proceeding, FRA conducted a series of workshops to obtain the industry's views on the need for and substance
of any changes to FRA's regulations. One such workshop session, announced in Notice No. 4 of that ANPRM issued on February
18, 1993 (58 FR 8928), and held in Washington, D.C. on March 31, 1993 addressed specifically the issue of protection
of roadway workers from being struck by moving trains and equipment. Since that workshop, FRA has received petitions
for emergency orders and rulemaking on the topic from the Brotherhood of Maintenance-of-Way Employees and the Brotherhood
of Railroad Signalmen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA originally planned to include protection from moving trains and moving equipment into a new Subpart G of 49 CFR
Part 213, but it will now be considered as part of 49 CFR Part 214, Railroad Workplace Safety. Given FRA's desire to address
this issue on an expedited basis, and because it relates more closely to workplace safety than to track standards,
this proceeding is now separated from FRA Docket No. RST&hyph;90&hyph;1 and has been placed in FRA Docket No. RSOR
13. Items related to this subject which were submitted as part of Docket No. RST&hyph;90&hyph;1 will be considered
as part of this proceeding, as will the transcript of the public workshop on March 31, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
(B) Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FRA is taking this action for the purpose of reducing the risk of death or injury railroad roadway workers face when
struck by moving trains and railroad equipment. Since 1989, 21 roadway workers have been fatally injured by moving
trains and equipment. Eight workers were struck by trains while performing work, three were struck by trains on track
adjacent to the work location, five stepped into a train's path, and five were struck by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance-of-way equipment. These fatalities are among the following crafts: signal maintainers, machine operators,
welders, track foremen, track inspectors, and track laborers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These figures reflect a serious problem that may require changes in railroad operating rules, training and practices.
In order to address the problem in the short term, FRA Administrator Molitoris convened a meeting on June 3, 1994 at
which FRA distributed summaries of the fatalities, and enlisted the support of the industry to address the issue immediately
on each railroad through local labor/management committees. FRA also discussed the option of proceeding with a negotiated
rulemaking, and has since preliminarily concluded that this issue is an appropriate subject for negotiated rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
(C) Terminology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FRA proposes that the term ``roadway worker'' rather than ``maintenance of way employee'' be used in this proceeding
to define the subject persons. This term would encompass all employees of a railroad or a contractor to a railroad who
construct, maintain, inspect or repair railroad tracks, structures, signal and train control systems, communication
systems, utility systems, or any other fixed property of a railroad while in close or potentially close proximity
to tracks on which trains or equipment can be operated. The term would apply regardless of the craft or class title of
the employee, affiliation with any labor organization, or rank within the railroad organization. Examples of subject
persons would be trackmen, signal maintainers, bridge workers, communication technicians, electricians, surveyors,
roadmasters and chief engineers, while performing their duties along the line of road. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA believes that extensive input from all interested parties is necessary to develop a rule that will address both
the risk of injury from moving railroad equipment and the operational concerns that this issue presents. Therefore,
this notice announces FRA's proposal to address these issues through a negotiated rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Set forth below are the basic concepts of negotiated rulemaking, suggested procedures to be followed, and criteria
for participant selection. In order to begin this process shortly, FRA asks that parties representing interests
affected by a roadway worker safety rule request appointment or representation on the Committee within thirty days
of publication of this notice.

II. Regulatory Negotiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Due to the increasing complexity and formalization of the written rulemaking process, it can be difficult for an agency
to craft effective regulatory solutions to certain problems. In the typical rulemaking process, the participants
often develop adversarial relationships that prevent effective communication and creative solutions. The exchange
of ideas that may lead to solutions acceptable to all interested groups often does not occur in the traditional notice
and comment system. As the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) noted in its Recommendation 82&hyph;4:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
Experience indicates that if the parties in interest were to work together to negotiate the text of a proposed rule,
they might be able in some circumstances to identify the major issues, gauge their importance to the respective parties,
identify the information and data necessary to resolve the issues, and develop a rule that is acceptable to the respective
interests, all within the contours of the substantive statute.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ACUS adopted this recommendation in ``Procedures for Negotiating Proposed Regulations,'' 47 FR 30708, June 18,
1982. The thrust of the recommendation is that representatives of all interests should be assembled to discuss the
issue or hazard and all potential solutions, reach consensus, and prepare a proposed rule for consideration by the
agency. After public comment on any proposal issued by the agency, the group would reconvene to review the comments
and make recommendations for a final rule. This inclusive process is intended to make the rule more acceptable to all
affected interests and prevent the need for petitions for reconsideration and litigation that often follow promulgation
of a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The movement toward negotiated rulemaking gained impetus with enactment of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990
(Reg-Neg), 5 U.S.C. &sect;561, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
More recently, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12866 (EO) (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), which states the
need to reform the current regulatory process into one that is effective, consistent, and understandable. The objectives
of the EO are:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To reaffirm the primacy of Federal agencies in the regulatory decision-making process; to restore the integrity
and legitimacy of regulatory review and oversight; and to make the process more accessible and open to the public.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(a) of the EO charges government agencies with providing the public meaningful participation in the regulatory
process:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In particular, before issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, each agency should, where appropriate, seek the involvement
of those who are intended to benefit from and those expected to be burdened by any regulation . . . Each agency is also
directed to explore and, where appropriate, use consensual mechanisms for developing regulations, including negotiated
rulemaking.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

at 51740. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although relatively new, negotiated rulemakings have been used successfully by many regulatory agencies, including
the Federal Aviation Administration, the United States Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. FRA now intends to begin this process in a formalized manner for the
first time, and does so with enthusiasm and high expectations. FRA welcomes the opportunity to work with those who
will be affected directly by a roadway worker safety rule, and is confident that the agency and the industry will benefit
from the process by creating an effective and reasonable regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 563(a) of Reg-Neg, an agency considering rulemaking by negotiation should consider whether:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) There is a need for the rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There is a limited number of identifiable interests; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) These interests can be adequately represented by persons willing to negotiate in good faith to reach a consensus;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) There is a reasonable likelihood that the committee will reach consensus within a fixed period of time; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The negotiated rulemaking procedure will not unreasonably delay the notice of proposed rulemaking; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) the agency has adequate resources and is willing to commit such resources to the process; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The agency is committed to use the result of the negotiation in formulating a proposed rule if at all possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons stated in this Notice, FRA believes that these criteria have been met with respect to railroad roadway
safety issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulatory negotiation FRA proposes would be carried out by an advisory committee (Committee) created under
the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended, 5 U.S.C. App., and in a manner that reflects appropriate rulemaking
objectives, including pertinent Executive Orders. FRA will be represented on the Committee and will take an active
part in the negotiations as a Committee member. However, pursuant to section 566(c) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reg-Neg, the person(s) designated to represent FRA would not facilitate or otherwise chair the proceedings. The
agency is committed to this process and is quite optimistic that it will result in the issuance of an NPRM and final rule
that will be acceptable to the members of the Committee. Because of the need to issue a rule on this subject, FRA is prepared
to go forward with an NPRM that is not the product of the negotiations in the unlikely event the negotiation fails or
if the Committee's recommendation is not acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Procedures and Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following proposed procedures and guidelines would apply to this process, subject to appropriate changes made
as a result of comments received on this Notice or as are determined to be necessary during the negotiating process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Facilitator: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA is seeking the services of a facilitator for the negotiating group. The facilitator will not be involved with substantive
development of this regulation. This individual will chair the negotiations, may offer alternative suggestions
toward the desired consensus, will help participants define and reach consensus, and will determine the feasibility
of negotiating particular issues. The facilitator may ask members to submit additional information or to reconsider
their position. FRA will contact mediation organizations for potential candidates, and will consider nominations
made in comments received in response to this Notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Feasibility: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA has examined the issues and interests involved and has made a preliminary inquiry among representatives of those
interests to determine whether it is possible to reach agreement on: (a) individuals to represent those interests;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the preliminary scope of the issues to be addressed; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) a schedule for developing a notice of proposed rulemaking. On the basis of the history of this issue and our preliminary
inquiry, we believe that regulatory negotiation could be successful in developing a workable proposal for a notice
of proposed rulemaking and a final rule, and that the potential participants listed below would adequately represent
the affected interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Participants and Interests: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The number of committee participants generally should not exceed 25. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Please note that each individual or organization affected by a final rule need not have its own representative on the
Committee. Rather, each interest must be adequately represented, and the Committee should be fairly balanced. Individuals
who are not part of the Committee may attend sessions and confer with or provide their views to Committee members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following interests have been tentatively identified as those that are likely to be significantly affected by
the rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Railroad labor organizations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Railroads, including classes 1 through 3, the short lines, public transit operations, and their associations;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Contractors to railroads who perform roadway work; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Federal government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA proposes that persons selected by the various interests be named to the Committee. The following interests have
been tentatively identified as those that would supply Committee members: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Brotherhood of Maintenance-of-Way Employes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The American Train Dispatchers Association; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Association of American Railroads; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The American Short Line Railroad Association; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) American Public Transit Association; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) FRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in paragraph F of this notice, FRA invites applications for representation from any interests that will
be affected by a rule, but are not named in this list. FRA is committed to an open and comprehensive negotiation, and
therefore strongly encourages any such party to file an application for membership. These applications may come
from railroads, labor organizations, associations, or other interests, must be filed within thirty days, and must
meet the requirements set forth in this notice. Also, the interests listed above and those who apply for representation
on the Committee should provide the name(s) of the individual(s) they propose to represent their interests. The Committee
should not exceed twenty-five members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Good Faith: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants must be committed to negotiate in good faith. It is therefore important that senior individuals within
each interest group be designated to represent that interest. No individual will be required to ``bind'' the interests
he or she represents, but the individual should be at a high enough level to represent the interest with confidence.
For this process to be successful, the interests represented should be willing to accept the final Committee product.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of Intent to Establish Advisory Committee and Request for Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the requirements of FACA, an agency of the Federal government cannot establish or utilize a group
of people in the interest of obtaining consensus advice or recommendations unless that group is chartered as a Federal
advisory committee. It is the purpose of this Notice to indicate our intent to create a Federal advisory committee,
to identify the issues involved in the rulemaking, to identify the interests affected by the rulemaking, to identify
potential participants who will adequately represent those interests, and to ask for comment on the use of regulatory
negotiation and on the identification of the issues, interests, procedures, and participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requests for Representation: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One purpose of this Notice is to determine whether interests exist that may be substantially affected by a rule, but
have not been represented in the list of prospective Committee members. Please identify such interests if they exist.
Each application for membership or nomination to the Committee should include: (i) the name of the applicant or nominee
and the interests such person would represent; (ii) evidence that the applicant or nominee is authorized to represent
parties related to the interests the person proposes to represent; (iii) a written commitment that the applicant
or nominee would participate in good faith; and (iv) the reasons any representative identified in the Notice does
not represent the interests the nominee is alleged to represent. If an additional person or interest requests membership
or representation on the Committee, FRA shall determine (i) whether that interest will be substantially affected
by the rule, (ii) if such interest would be adequately represented by an individual already on the Committee, and (iii)
whether the requester should be added to the group or whether interests can be consolidated to provide adequate representation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final Notice: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After evaluating comments received as a result of this notice, FRA will issue a final notice announcing the establishment
of the Federal advisory committee, unless it determines that such action is inappropriate in light of comments received,
and the composition of the Committee. After the Committee is chartered the negotiations would begin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Administrative Support and Meetings: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Staff support would be provided by FRA and meetings would take place in Washington, D.C., unless agreed otherwise
by the Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative Schedule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Committee is established and selected, FRA will publish a schedule for the first meeting in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The first meeting will focus on procedural matters, including dates, times, and locations of future meetings. Notice
of subsequent meetings would also be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 before being held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA expects that the Committee would reach consensus and prepare a report recommending a proposed rule within six
months of the first meeting. However, if unforeseen delays occur, the Administrator may agree to an extension of that
time if a consensus of the Committee believes that additional time will result in agreement. The process may end earlier
if the facilitator so recommends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(J) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Committee Procedures: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the general guidance of the facilitator, and subject to legal requirements, the Committee would establish
the detailed procedures for meetings which it considers appropriate.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Record of Meetings: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with FACA's requirements, FRA would keep a record of all Committee meetings. This record would be placed
in the public docket for this rulemaking. Meetings of the Committee would generally be open to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(L) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consensus: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The goal of the negotiating process is consensus. FRA proposes that the Committee would develop its own definition
of consensus, which may include unanimity, a simple majority, or substantial agreement such that no member will disapprove
the final recommendation of the Committee. However, if the Committee does not develop its own definition, consensus
shall be unanimous concurrence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(M)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Final Rule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee's first objective is to prepare a report containing a notice of proposed rulemaking, preamble, and
economic evalutation. If consensus is not obtained on some issues, the report should identify the areas of agreement
and disagreement, and explanations for any disagreement. It is expected that participants will address cost/benefit,
paperwork reduction, and regulatory flexibility requirements. FRA would prepare an economic assessment if appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA would issue the proposed rule as prepared by the Committee unless it is inconsistent with statutory authority
of the agency or other legal requirements or does not, in the agency's view, adequately address the subject matter.
If that occurs, FRA would explain the reasons for its decision, or would modify the proposal in a way that allows the
public to distinguish modifications from the original proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee would reconvene to review comments received in response to publication of the proposed rule and would
negotiate to produce a recommended final rule. FRA would issue the recommended final rule as prepared by the Committee
unless it is inconsistent with statutory authority of the agency or other legal requirements or does not, in the agency's
view, adequately address the subject matter. If that occurs, FRA would explain the reasons for its decision, or would
modify the recommended final rule in a way that allows the public to distinguish modifications from the recommended
final rule.

(N) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Key Issues for Negotiation: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA has reviewed correspondence, petitions, injury data, existing railroad operating practices, and has engaged
in extensive dialogue concerning the protection of roadway workers. Based on this information and rulemaking requirements,
FRA has tentatively identified major issues that should be considered in this negotiated rulemaking. Other issues
related to roadway protection not specifically listed in this Notice may be addressed as they arise in the course of
the negotiation. Comments are invited concerning the appropriateness of these issues for consideration and whether
other issues should be added.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Are devices available that may be used to reduce the risk of danger to roadway workers? If so, how do these devices
work and what are the costs associated with them? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Are there appropriate procedures or operating practices that may be instituted effectively to reduce the risk
of danger to roadway workers? If so, what are the costs that will be associated with implementing these practices and
procedures? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Are there appropriate training programs that may be given to reduce the risk of danger to roadway workers? If so,
at what intervals should they be taught? Also, what are the costs and the time associated with such a program? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Are there peculiar topographical, environmental, and operational conditions that must be considered in developing
a program to reduce the risk of harm to roadway workers? What are the specific conditions, and how do they vary from one
region to another, and from one railroad to another? What would the cost for this program be? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Should any program developed vary according to the size of a railroad? If so, explain why such variations are necessary
and how the programs should differ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. What recordkeeping and reporting requirements, if any, should be instituted to advance the safety of roadway workers?
What is the amount of time and cost involved with these requirements? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. What enforcement procedures should FRA utilize to ensure compliance with any rule developed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Aside from the obvious benefit of providing safer working conditions and so reducing the risk of injury and death
for roadway workers, are there additional benefits (both monetary and non-monetary) that will result from the implementation
of a rule concerning roadway workers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Do any railroads currently have internal operating practices that address the intended purposes of this negotiated
rulemaking? If so, please provide the background for implementation of these practices, and a description of their
effectiveness. Also, what were the costs and benefits associated with implementing these practices?

Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1533) (Act), requires that the Service
make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist or reclassify a species presents substantial scientific or commercial
information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. To the maximum extent practicable, this finding
is to be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Service determines that the subject petition did not present substantial information indicating that the requested
action may be warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 10, 1992, the Service received a petition to list the scaled dune Buprestid beetle (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lepismadora algodones
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as an endangered species. The petition was submitted by Dr. Charles Bellamy of Escondido, California and was dated
August 5, 1992. The petition stated that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. algodones
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is imperiled because its current distribution is small, its population size is low, and its habitat is being depleted
and degraded by off-highway vehicles (OHVs).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scaled dune buprestid beetle was first collected in 1985 along the western edge of the Algodones Sand Hills, near
Glamis, Imperial County, California (Bellamy 1992). The beetle was first described in 1987 by R.K. Velten (Velten
and Bellamy 1987). It is quite distinct from other buprestids in North America (Bellamy 1992). The species has been
collected from its type locality every year since 1985.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scaled dune buprestid beetle occupies ecotonal vegetation between Sonoran creosote bush scrub and southern
dune scrub along the perimeter of the Algodones Sand Hills, an area of extensive sand dunes approximately 45 miles
(70 kilometers) in length. Dominant shrubs in this habitat include 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Larrea divaricata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (creosote), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ephedra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sp., and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eriogonum deserticola
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Imperial buckwheat). A variety of perennial herbs as also present in this habitat. Adult beetles have been observed
feeding on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tiquila plicata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (plicate coldenia), but no information is available on larval hosts or the species' population biology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Land Management owns the lands supporting the beetle. Portions of the Algodones Sand Hills are heavily
used by OHVs and are completely denuded of vegetation. A large portion of the sand hills are closed to OHV use, and much
of the open section of the dunes are unaffected by OHVs, because the area is not easily accessible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Bellamy (pers. comm. 1992) suggested that the scaled dune buprestid is restricted to a single large colony, located
in the closed portion of the dunes. He acknowledge that seemingly suitable habitat exists along the perimeter of the
Algodones Sand Hills. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tiquila plicata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, an adult food plant, is common along the perimeter of the dunes. Dr. Bellamy indicated that much of the area has not
been surveyed because it is inaccessible without using OHVs, which would potentially damage the species habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully reviewed the petition and interviewed Dr. Bellamy. Based upon this information, the Service
has determined that substantial information has not been presented indicating that the listing of the scaled dune
buprestid may be warranted. This finding is based upon a lack of data for the vast majority of apparently suitable habitat,
coupled with a lack of documentation of threats facing this species.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to amend the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) that prescribe the certification and training
requirements for mechanics and repairmen. Current regulations prescribing these certification requirements
do not reflect the significant technological advances that have occurred in the aviation industry and the enhancements
in training and instructional methods that have affected all aviation maintenance personnel. The proposed rule
would consolidate and clarify all certification, training, experience, and currency requirements for aviation
maintenance personnel in a newly established Part 66 of the FAR. The proposal would enhance aviation safety by establishing
new training programs for aviation maintenance personnel and would decrease the regulatory burden on these personnel
by providing alternatives for meeting experience and currency requirements. The proposed rule would enhance the
technical capabilities and increase the level of professionalism among aviation maintenance personnel. All proposals
are based on recommendations developed by the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC).

Background

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In keeping with the FAA's policy of reviewing and upgrading regulations to ensure that they are consistent with changes
in the aviation environment, the FAA is conducting a two-phase regulatory review to amend Part 65, Subparts D and E
(14 CFR Part 65) of the FAR, which pertain to mechanics, mechanics holding inspection authorizations, and repairmen.
Since the recodification requirements for these airmen has not been accomplished and few significant revisions
to the subparts have been made. However, numerous technological advances in the aviation industry, recent FAA and
international regulatory activities, concerns over aging aircraft, and enhancements in training methods have
significantly affected all aspects of maintenance operations. Additionally, various and often conflicting interpretations
of the existing regulations periodically have resulted in confusion among the airmen for whom this part was intended.
Because of these factors, the FAA has instituted this complete regulatory review of Part 65, Subparts D and E.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In November 1989, a joint industry/FAA Part 65 review group was formed to evaluate and review certification requirements
for mechanics and repairmen. The review group's objective was to develop and present a unified position on Part 65.
The group comprised representatives from several aviation associations and was coordinated by the Professional
Aviation Maintenance Association (PAMA). FAA interests were represented by the Aircraft Maintenance Division
(AFS&hyph;300) of the FAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review group conducted a series of panel discussions throughout the United States and, as a result, drafted the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Industry/FAA Part 65 Review Group Working Paper, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which was published on January 31, 1991. This paper presented the issues of general agreement within the review group
and also presented those issues that the group believed would require further discussion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further impetus for the Part 65 review came with ARAC's establishment. The ARAC charter became effective on February
5, 1991. ARAC was established to assist the FAA in the rulemaking process by providing input from outside the Government
on major regulatory issues affecting aviation safety. ARAC includes representatives of air carriers, manufacturers,
general aviation, labor groups, universities, associations, airline passenger groups, and the general public.
Under the framework provided by ARAC, the previously established Part 65 review group became a working group of ARAC.
ARAC's formation has given the FAA additional opportunities to solicit information directly from significantly
affected parties who meet and exchange ideas about proposed rules and existing rules that should either be revised
or eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issues agreed upon by the review group in the January 31, 1991, working paper and the consensus achieved at subsequent
meetings of the Part 65 working group have become the basis for the changes proposed in this NPRM, which constitute
phase I of the Part 65 regulatory review. The issues that require further discussion and agreement by the members of
the working group (such as the evaluation of any potential for additional certificates and ratings and the expansion
of aviation repair specialist privileges) will become the basis for phase II of the regulatory review and a subsequent
NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In support of this regulatory review, the FAA completed a historical review of Part 65, Subparts D and E, on October
22, 1991. This review revealed that there have been 17 amendments (1 of which was rescinded), 3 petitions for rulemaking,
and 100 exemption actions to these subparts since recodification. In addition, one accident, the Aloha Airlines
Boeing 737 structural failure on April 28, 1988, generated National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendations
related to these subparts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three petitions for rulemaking addressed issues associated with establishing certificates and ratings for
avionics and instrument technicians, recertifying mechanics, and allowing applicants for mechanic certificates
who desire to qualify on the basis of experience and have not graduated from an approved Part 147 aviation maintenance
technician school to take the oral and practical tests for a certificate or rating before completing the required
written tests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of requests for exemption, FAA policy letters, and legal interpretations regarding mechanics pertained
to inspection authorization renewal or the general eligibility and experience requirements. The majority of actions
concerning repairmen involved certificate privileges and limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also conducted a survey of FAA regional offices on the certification of mechanics, holders of inspection authorizations,
and repairmen during 1991. A copy of this survey has been placed in docket number 27863. The survey questions were derived
from issues that surfaced during FAA participation in listening sessions with aviation industry associations and
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Aircraft Maintenance Engineer Licensing Panel and from issues
identified in legal interpretations, petitions for exemption, petitions for rulemaking, and enforcement actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Results of this survey showed clear support for: (1) replacing the term ``mechanic'' with ``aviation maintenance
technician''; (2) developing a system for granting additional privileges and limitations for mechanics; (3) encouraging
additional FAA participation with ICAO and other aviation authorities to standardize training and certification
of maintenance personnel; (4) using aviation maintenance instructor experience to satisfy recent experience requirements;
(5) clarifying &sect;65.75(b), written test requirements; (6) adding ``facsimile'' to &sect;65.16; and (7) developing
a separate certificate or rating for balloon repairmen. The majority of the respondents supported changes in the
English-language requirements for both mechanics and repairmen, the continued acceptance of military aircraft
maintenance experience as the basis for airframe and powerplant mechanic certification, and changing the units
of time used in &sect;65.77 to designate experience requirements for mechanics from months to hours.

(1) establish a separate part for aviation maintenance personnel; (2) remove gender-specific terms from the current
regulation; (3) change the term ``mechanic'' to ``aviation maintenance technician''; (4) change the term ``repairman''
to ``aviation repair specialist''; (5) establish the equivalency of the aviation maintenance technician and aviation
repair specialist certificates with current certificates; (6) allow facsimiles to be used in the process of replacing
lost or destroyed aviation maintenance technician and aviation repair specialist certificates; (7) require applicants
to demonstrate English-language proficiency by reading and explaining appropriate maintenance publications
and by writing defect and repair statements; (8) discontinue the certification of aviation maintenance personnel
who are employed outside the United States and are not proficient in the English language; (9) require all aviation
maintenance technician applicants to pass a written test that would examine their knowledge of all applicable maintenance
regulations; (10) clarify the requirement that each applicant for an aviation maintenance technician certificate
pass all sections of the written test before applying for oral and practical tests; (11) recognize new computer-based
testing methods; (12) specify all experience requirements in hours instead of months; (13) establish a basic competency
requirement for aviation maintenance technicians; (14) allow aviation maintenance technicians to use equipment-specific
training as an additional means to qualify for the exercise of certificate privileges; (15) permit aviation maintenance
instructors to use instructional time to satisfy currency requirements; (16) establish training requirements
for aviation maintenance technicians who desire to use their certificates for compensation or hire; (17) extend
the duration of an inspection authorization from 1 to 2 years; and (18) expand the renewal options available to the
holder of an inspection authorization.

Principal Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Establishment of a Separate Subpart for Aviation Maintenance Personnel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA proposes to establish a new Part 66 under the title, Certification: Aviation Maintenance Technicians and
Aviation Repair Specialists. This new part would be created by removing Subparts D (Mechanics) and E (Repairmen)
from the current Part 65 and using these existing subparts as the nucleus for the newly created Subparts B (Aviation
Maintenance Technicians) and C (Aviation Repair Specialists) under Part 66. The sections of the current Part 65 Subpart
A (General) that apply only to aviation maintenance personnel would be included in Subpart A of the proposed Part 66.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to regulating the certification requirements for aviation maintenance personnel, Part 65 also currently
regulates the certification of airmen such as aircraft dispatchers, air traffic controllers, and parachute riggers,
whose certification requirements and duties differ markedly from those of aviation maintenance personnel. Currently,
there are more than 145,000 certificated mechanics and repairmen. The number of certificated aviation maintenance
personnel is second only to the number of certificated pilots. Aviation maintenance personnel work in all aspects
of the aviation environment, perform tasks vastly different from those performed by other airmen, and are affected
by training and currency requirements that are substantially more extensive than those affecting other airmen currently
regulated by Part 65.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The aviation maintenance sector is one of the most complex sectors of the aviation community and all aviation maintenance
personnel must possess many technical skills. The addition of this part to the FAR is warranted because of the complexity
of the certification and training requirements affecting aviation maintenance personnel. In addition, the certification
requirements for aviation maintenance personnel are expanding under this proposed rule, and additional certificates
and ratings are proposed for creation under phase II of the regulatory review.

Removal of Gender-Specific Terms

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the FAA's policy of implementing gender-neutral regulations and maintaining conformity with
other recently revised airman certification regulations that are now gender-neutral, and in view of the increased
role of women in the aviation maintenance profession, the FAA proposes to eliminate all gender-specific references
in current Part 65 and proposed Part 66. These changes are reflected in the proposed amendment; however, specific
changes are not listed in the section-by-section general analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Redesignation of the Term ``Mechanic''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of changes in aircraft technology, the amount of specialized training required to perform aviation maintenance
has increased significantly since the introduction of the term ``mechanic.'' The highly complex and technical field
of contemporary aviation maintenance requires substantially more than the manual skills typically associated
with individuals classified as mechanics. The FAA asserts that the term ``aviation maintenance technician'' more
completely describes the type of skills necessary to maintain today's complex aircraft and more accurately reflects
the level of professionalism found in the aviation maintenance industry. Additionally, adoption of the term ``aviation
maintenance technician'' would standardize terminology throughout the aviation industry and make Part 66 consistent
with Part 147 of the FAR (which regulates Aviation Maintenance Technician Schools), aviation maintenance trade
publications, and many ICAO member states. These changes are reflected in the proposed amendment, however, specific
changes have not been listed in the section-by-section general analysis.

Redesignation of the Term ``Repairman''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In view of the specialized nature of aviation maintenance tasks performed by currently certificated repairmen,
the FAA proposes that the term ``aviation repair specialist'' replace the current term ``repairman.'' The FAA contends
that the term ``aviation repair specialist'' more accurately reflects the level of expertise required to maintain
today's highly complex aviation systems. In addition, the use of the term ``aviation repair specialist'' would serve
to increase the level of professionalism among aviation maintenance personnel. Adoption of the term would also be
consistent with the FAA's policy of implementing gender-neutral regulations. These changes are reflected in the
proposed amendment; however, specific changes have not been listed in the section-by-section general analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Equivalency of Ratings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any valid mechanic or repairman certificate would be equivalent to an aviation maintenance technician or aviation
repair specialist certificate, respectively. After implementation of this regulation, the holder of a current
mechanic or repairman certificate may continue to exercise the privileges of the corresponding aviation maintenance
technician or aviation repair specialist certificate and may exchange a current mechanic or repairman certificate
for an aviation maintenance technician or aviation repair specialist certificate respectively. Phase I of the regulatory
review does not create additional certificates or ratings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Replacement of Lost or Destroyed Certificates by Facsimile
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would revise current procedures by permitting an airman who has lost a certificate issued under proposed
Part 66 to request a facsimile of the certificate from the FAA as confirmation of the certificate's original issuance.
The proposal would also allow any request to the FAA to be made by facsimile and would permit the FAA to send directly
to the airman a facsimile that the airman may carry as proof of the original certificate's issuance for a period not
to exceed 60 days. Adoption of the proposed change would make the rule consistent with current practices implemented
by the Airman Certification Branch (AVN&hyph;460) at the Aviation Standards National Field Office in Oklahoma City.
Current regulations specify the use of telegrams only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change reflects advancements in communications technology and would speed access to FAA services by permitting
the use of other means, such as telephone facsimile or computer modem, to obtain a replacement certificate. The use
of these means would speed the replacement of lost certificates to the airman, thereby decreasing the time during
which the airman may not exercise the privileges of a certificate of rating. Similar provisions are under consideration
for adoption in other parts of the FAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Demonstration of English-Language Proficiency and Removal of Exception Criteria for Applicants Employed Outside
the United States Who Are Not Proficient in the English Language
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would require an applicant for an aviation maintenance technician certificate or aviation repair specialist
certificate to read, write, speak, and understand the English language, as is currently required for applicants
desiring to exercise the privileges of the certificate within the United States. The proposal would require the applicant
to demonstrate this knowledge by reading and explaining appropriate maintenance publications and by writing defect
and repair statements. The proposal also would eliminate the issuances of certificates to individuals who cannot
meet this requirement and are employed solely outside the United States by a certificated U.S. repair station, or
a certificated U.S. air carrier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal recognizes the highly technical nature of aviation maintenance in today's aviation industry. Proficiency
with the general terminology of the English language is not sufficient to ensure the competency of an aviation maintenance
technician or repair specialist. The individual must be able to understand and master the complex and often very specialized
language of airworthiness instructions and other terminology associated with the maintenance of highly sophisticated
aviation equipment. In operations conducted at certificated U.S. air carriers, certificated U.S. commercial operators,
and U.S.-certificated repair stations, the vast majority of technical information is conveyed in the English language.
The FAA has determined that the proposed rule would guarantee a level of competency that would ensure that an applicant
for either certificate is able to use all relevant maintenance publications effectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also proposed that the current exception, which permits the certification of mechanics (aviation maintenance
technicians) who are employed outside the United States and are not proficient in the English language, be deleted.
The current airframe, powerplant, and general written tests for mechanics are all written in the English language.
Applicants taking these tests must be proficient in the English language to complete these examinations successfully;
therefore, the exception is not necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although repairmen (aviation repair specialists) are not required to take written tests, these individuals also
work in environments that require more than mere proficiency in the English language. Because the FAA does not certify
repairmen working under U.S.-certificated foreign repair stations and because of the need for all certificated
repairmen to understand technical material written in English, the FAA also proposed that all repairmen (aviation
repair specialists) demonstrate proficiency in the English language and that the exception allowing individuals
who are not proficient in the English language to be certificated to work only outside the United States be deleted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current holders of a mechanic or repairman certificate, who do not meet the English language requirement and are employed
outside of the United States by a certificated U.S. air carrier or a certificated U.S. repair station, would continue
to exercise the privileges of their certificate without a further showing of competency. Their certificates would
remain endorsed ``Valid only outside of the United States.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Establishment of a Requirement for Aviation Maintenance Technicians To Pass a Written Test on all Applicable Provisions
of Chapter 14
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations require an applicant for a mechanic (aviation maintenance technician) certificate to pass
a written test that includes the applicable provisions of Parts 43 and 91 of this chapter. Because contemporary maintenance
operations require the applicant to understand certification and maintenance regulations other than those found
solely in Parts 43 and 91, the FAA proposes amending the knowledge requirements for the certificate to require an applicant
to pass a written test on the applicable provisions of the entire chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Clarification of Requirement To Pass all Sections of the Written Test Before Applying for the Oral and Practical Tests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There has been some confusion among applicants for the mechanic (aviation maintenance technician) certificate
who are not enrolled at Part-147-approved aviation maintenance technician schools regarding the language of &sect;65.75(b).
This section requires an individual to pass each section of the written test before applying for the oral and practical
tests prescribed by &sect;65.79. The FAA believes that it is essential that the applicant display knowledge of the
equipment and procedures to be used by the applicant before the oral and practical tests are given. The applicant must
possess adequate knowledge before being permitted to take the oral and practical tests, because it is this knowledge
that enables an applicant to solve practical problems and demonstrate the ability to perform the work of a certificated
aviation maintenance technician. In addition, when taking an oral or practical test, an applicant for a certificate
must handle complex equipment; a lack of knowledge about the use of that equipment could injure the applicant or others.
Therefore, the FAA has clarified the current requirement by proposing amendatory language that would require all
applicants, except students at an approved Part 147 aviation maintenance school, to pass all sections of the written
test before applying for the oral and practical tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Recognition of New Written Testing Methods
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the area of written testing, the FAA recognizes recent developments in training and testing technology. Because
the results of some written tests, such as those from recently approved computer-based testing, can be made immediately
available to the applicant, the FAA proposes that a report of the written test be made available, as opposed to sent,
to an applicant who has taken the examination using computer-based testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Specification of Experience Requirements in Hours
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA proposes that experience requirements for aviation maintenance personnel, currently expressed in months,
be expressed in an equivalent number of hours. A change to the hourly experience requirements would give the FAA and
the aviation industry a simpler method of measuring and verifying work experience. The proposed revision also would
enable aviation maintenance personnel working in part-time positions to better quantify their work experience.
FAA Order 8300.10, Airworthiness Inspector's Handbook, currently permits the practice of measuring part-time
experience requirements in hours. The proposed rule would expand this current practice by measuring both part-time
and full-time experience in hours. Equivalent levels of full time experience are: 6 months/1000 hours; 18 months/3000
hours; 30 months/5000 hours.

Establishment of Basic Competency Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently &sect;65.79, Skill requirements, requires an applicant for a mechanic certificate to pass an oral and
practical test covering the applicant's skills in performing practical projects covered by the written test. Because
of the complexity of current aviation maintenance operations, the FAA proposes to establish a broad-based competency
requirement in &sect;66.79 that encompasses more than the skill requirements included in the current regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current interpretations of the existing regulation tend to emphasize the evaluation of basic skills that often concentrate
solely on tasks involving manual dexterity. Although mastery of these basic skills is invaluable, the FAA asserts
that a more comprehensive level of competency, based on current aviation maintenance practices, is required of aviation
maintenance technicians. The proposed rule would expand the evaluation of aviation maintenance technician applicants
to include a demonstration of competency in technical tasks and aircraft maintenance more appropriate to the current
aviation environment and the certificate and rating sought.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of Equipment-Specific Training to Qualify for Certificate Privileges
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Through the use of equipment-specific training, the proposal would provide the holder of an aviation maintenance
technician certificate with an additional means to remain qualified to approve and return to service any aircraft,
appliance, or part for which that person is rated and to supervise the maintenance, preventive maintenance, alteration,
and return to service of these aircraft, appliances, and parts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulation, a certificate holder may supervise maintenance operations or approve and return to
service an aircraft, appliance, or part if the certificate holder has: (1) previously performed the work; (2) performed
the work to the satisfaction of the Administrator; or (3) performed the work under the direct supervision of a certificated
mechanic or repairman who has had previous experience with that specific task.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would allow the aviation maintenance technician to use equipment-specific training to obtain the competency
necessary to supervise these operations or approve an item for return to service without previously having performed
the work that is anticipated. Through the adoption of equipment-specific training to satisfy this experience requirement,
the FAA recognized enhancements in aviation maintenance training that can provide the aviation maintenance technician
with technical knowledge equal to knowledge gained in the work environment. However, in allowing training to replace
actual work experience, the FAA would require a high level of specificity between the training and the actual work
to be preformed or supervised. Therefore, the proposal would require that the training used to satisfy this requirement
be unique to the specific equipment on which the work is to be performed. A course of instruction detailing the maintenance
practices for the same make and model aircraft on which an aviation maintenance technician will perform work, or a
course of instruction detailing the overhaul procedures for a specific part or appliance, for example, would satisfy
the provisions of the proposed rule. Such courses may be provided by any manufacturer, individual, or organization
whose training has been found acceptable to the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training of a more general nature, which may be used to satisfy currency requirements as proposed in &sect;66.83,
may not be sufficiently specific to allow an aviation maintenance technician to perform work on a specific aircraft,
part, or appliance. For example, a course in the FAR applicable to maintenance procedures would not satisfy the provisions
of proposed &sect;66.81 but could be used to satisfy the provisions of proposed &sect;66.83.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also proposes to clarify the intent of the current regulation by proposing amendatory language that would
allow a certificate holder, who desires to exercise supervisory, return to service, or approval responsibilities,
to demonstrate the ability to perform the work to the satisfaction of the Administrator. The current regulation requires
actual performance of the work.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of Instructional Time by Aviation Maintenance Instructors to Satisfy Currency Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under current &sect;65.83, there are no provisions for allowing individuals involved in aviation maintenance instruction
to use that experience for maintaining the currency required to exercise the privileges of their certificate and
ratings. The FAA recognizes that the experience gained while providing aviation maintenance instruction or directly
supervising other aviation maintenance instructors is commensurate with the experience obtained while directly
performing aviation maintenance. The FAA already recognizes this experience in current &sect;65.91(c)(2). Within
that section the phrase ``actively engaged'' includes instructors who are exercising the privileges of their certificate
and ratings at an aviation maintenance school certificated under Part 147 of this chapter. Therefore, the FAA proposes
to allow the use of instructional time also to satisfy currency requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, a certificate holder would qualify to maintain currency by serving as an aviation maintenance
instructor or by directly supervising other aviation maintenance instructors under his or her certificate or rating.
The instruction concerned would have to be directly related to aviation maintenance and acceptable to the Administrator,
so that the time an individual spends providing instruction or directly supervising other instructors is equivalent
to the experience gained while performing aviation maintenance tasks. For example, instructional time provided
at Part 147 aviation maintenance technician schools or under an approved air carrier maintenance training program
would be acceptable and would meet the intent of the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of currency requirements is to ensure that all aviation maintenance technicians are familiar with current
maintenance practices and the applicable FAR. The aviation maintenance instructor must keep abreast of current
maintenance practices in a wide variety of disciplines to provide the high quality instruction required. Aviation
maintenance instructors perform a critical function in the aviation maintenance education process, and the FAA
believes that the adoption of the proposed rule would recognize this importance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Establishment of Training Requirements for Certificated Aviation Maintenance Technicians Exercising the Privileges
of their Certificates for Compensation or Hire
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under current Part 65, there are no specific provisions that require the training of certificated mechanics. Current
regulations ensure that certificated aviation maintenance technicians supporting operations under Parts 121,
127, 135, and 145.2(a) are informed fully about procedures, techniques, and new equipment in use through participation
in maintenance and preventive maintenance training programs. In an effort to ensure that all aviation maintenance
technicians are informed of current maintenance practices in the rapidly changing aviation maintenance environment,
the FAA proposes the adoption of refresher training, requalification training, and other training appropriate
to the duties of the aviation maintenance technician, for aviation maintenance technicians who use their certificates
for compensation or hire and do not participate in the maintenance and preventive maintenance training programs
referenced above. This proposal would ensure that all aviation maintenance technicians who exercise the privileges
of their certificates for compensation or hire and have the sole responsibility for ensuring the airworthiness of
the equipment on which they perform maintenance meet training requirements similar to those currently in place for
aviation maintenance technicians supporting operations under Parts 121, 127, 135, and 145.2(a). In addition, this
proposal would also ensure that aviation maintenance technicians who support U.S. certificated repair stations
that do not have maintenance and preventive maintenance training programs receive comparable training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, an aviation maintenance technician who meets the prescribed work experience requirements
and wishes to exercise the privileges of the certificate or rating for compensation or hire would be required to complete
refresher training or other training appropriate to the duties of an aviation maintenance technician.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An aviation maintenance technician refresher course, inspection authorization refresher course, or a series of
such courses that are acceptable to the Administrator and consist of a total of not less than 16 hours of instruction
within a 24-month period could be used to satisfy the refresher training requirement. The completion of an inspection
authorization refresher course by an aviation maintenance technician who does not hold a current inspection authorization
would also constitute completion of the mandatory aviation maintenance technician training requirement. Adoption
of such a provision would increase the range of training options available to the aviation maintenance technician
and would enhance the individual's understanding of the inspection authorization process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative to refresher training, an aviation maintenance technician wishing to exercise the privileges
of the certificate and ratings for compensation or hire may complete other training appropriate to the duties of an
aviation maintenance technician. This training may be broad based and would consist of a course or courses of instruction,
acceptable to the Administrator, of not less than 16 hours within a 24-month period. Completion of courses dealing
with general maintenance practices or regulations applicable to maintenance operations, for example, would satisfy
the intent of this proposed rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA recognizes that many certificated aviation maintenance technicians, who support Part 91 operations or other
maintenance facilities without maintenance or preventive maintenance training programs in place, receive periodic
maintenance training. For example, these aviation maintenance technicians may receive training through aviation
training centers or manufacturer's courses. The proposed rule would permit this type of maintenance instruction
to be credited toward the hours needed to complete the proposed training requirements, provided the instruction
is acceptable to the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training required under this provision, as set forth in proposed &sect;66.83, encompasses more types of training
than the training that may be used to satisfy the provision of the proposed &sect;66.81. Therefore, compliance with
proposed &sect;66.83 does not automatically authorize the aviation maintenance technician to perform a specific
task. Additionally, equipment-specific training is encompassed within the concept of ``training appropriate
to the duties of an aviation maintenance technician.'' Equipment-specific training used by the aviation maintenance
technician to satisfy the requirements of proposed &sect;66.81 also may be used to satisfy the proposed currency
requirements. For example, an aviation maintenance technician who received maintenance training on a Gulfstream
IV aircraft that enabled the aviation maintenance technician to perform work on that specific aircraft may credit
the hours of instruction received toward the training required in proposed &sect;66.83.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual who exercises the privileges of the certificate, but not for compensation or hire, would not need to
complete these training requirements. Many of the individuals who do not exercise their privileges for compensation
or hire perform only limited work on aircraft that they own or on a limited range of aeronautical equipment. In such
cases, knowledge of a broad range of current maintenance technologies is not necessarily required. Although the
FAA encourages these personnel to attend refresher training, the FAA has determined that a mandatory training requirement
for these individuals is not warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also sets forth a provision that would permit an aviation maintenance technician who has not exercised
the privileges of the certificate within the preceding 24 months to exercise the privileges of the certificate including
for compensation or hire by completing requalification training acceptable to the Administrator. A specific minimum
time for requalification training has not been specified in the proposed regulation in order to provide instructors
and examiners with greater flexibility in assisting non-current aviation maintenance technicians to achieve the
required proficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional change to the current rule would enhance the ability of non-current aviation maintenance technicians
to regain the currency required to exercise the privileges of their certificate and ratings. The proposed rule would
allow these individuals to credit the time they work under the supervision of a certificated aviation maintenance
technician toward currency requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The holder also may continue to exercise the privileges of the certificate and associated ratings if the Administrator
finds that the aviation maintenance technician is competent to exercise those privileges. Passing an oral and practical
test with a designed aviation maintenance technician examiner (currently, a designated mechanic examiner (DME))
would satisfy this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 121.375, 127.137, and 135.433 require that an operator have a training program to ensure that persons performing
maintenance or preventive maintenance functions are informed fully about procedures and techniques and new equipment
in use. Additionally, &sect;145.2(a) requires that repair stations performing maintenance for a Part 121 or 127
operator comply with either Part 121, Subpart L (which includes the requirements of &sect;121.375) or Part 127, Subpart
I (which includes the requirements of &sect;127.137). Compliance with any of these sections meets the intent of the
proposed rule. Individuals exercising the privileges of their certificates under the provisions of these sections,
therefore, need not comply with the training requirements set forth in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, an aviation maintenance instructor teaching under an aviation maintenance training program acceptable
to the Administrator need not comply with these proposed training requirements. As a result of their position as aviation
maintenance instructors, these individuals continually are exposed to current maintenance practices and often
disseminate information about new practices, techniques, and equipment to the aviation maintenance community.
The intent of the proposed rule would be satisfied because their position requires these individuals to be fully informed
about current maintenance practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recognition of enhancements in training technology, the proposed rule also requires successful completion of
these courses rather than attendance and successful completion. Therefore, the Administrator may find home study
or video courses acceptable for fulfilling the requirements specified in the proposed &sect;66.83. However, any
training should include a substantial review of regulations pertinent to the exercise of the privileges and limitations
of the aviation maintenance technician certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal for continued aviation maintenance training addresses concerns such as those expressed in recent
proposals to require formal training for all aircraft mechanic applicants. In conjunction with the issuance of a
proposed final rule, the FAA will develop policy on the content and conduct of any aviation maintenance technician
refresher course, other training appropriate to the duties of the aviation maintenance technician (including equipment-specific
training), and requalification training.

Extension of Inspection Authorization Duration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule, the duration of an inspection authorization would be extended from the current 12 months
to 24 months. Extending the duration of the inspection authorization would make the authorization consistent with
FAA practices regarding the issuance of other renewable certificates, such as the flight instructor certificate,
which is renewed every 24 months. A 24-month renewal cycle would relieve the public of a significant regulatory burden
and FAA Flight Standards District Offices of a considerable administrative burden without compromising safety.
Modifying the existing training and currency requirements to coincide with the adoption of a 24-month renewal cycle
would give holders greater flexibility in meeting regulatory requirements.

Expansion of Inspection Authorization Renewal Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would permit the holder of an inspection authorization to use a combination of annual inspections, inspections
of major repairs or major alterations, and progressive inspections to satisfy the renewal requirements for the inspection
authorization. Such a provision would give the holder of an inspection authorization much greater flexibility in
meeting renewal requirements. To better facilitate the combination of these inspections for the purpose of certificate
renewal with other inspection periods currently designated in months, the proposal would change the currently specified
90-day periods for inspections to 3-month periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also permit the holder of an inspection authorization to use participation in current inspection
programs recommended by the manufacturer or other inspection programs established by the registered owner or operator
under &sect;91.409(f)(3) or (4) to satisfy renewal requirements. Although an inspection authorization is not required
by an aviation maintenance technician in order to participate in these inspection programs, the FAA asserts that
the experience gained through participation in such inspection programs is commensurate with the experience currently
accepted to obtain the inspection authorization renewal. This proposal would benefit holders of an inspection authorization
who are employed by operators that maintain aircraft under a current inspection program yet also maintain an insufficient
number of aircraft under other annual inspection programs to provide the holder of the inspection authorization
with sufficient renewal options under the current rule. The proposed rule would neither change the privileges of
the inspection authorization nor compromise safety because the types of aircraft normally maintained under a current
inspection program are often more complex than those maintained under an annual inspection program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulation, the holder of an inspection authorization may renew the inspection authorization
by attending and successfully completing a refresher course, acceptable to the Administrator, of not less than 8
hours during the 12-month period preceding the application for renewal. Because the proposal would modify the duration
of the inspection authorization to 24 months, it would require that an inspection authorization refresher course
or series of courses consisting of a total of not less than 16 hours be taken in the 24 months preceding the application
for renewal. The proposed rule would not change the total amount of instruction an applicant is required to complete
in the 24-month period preceding the application for renewal.

Under the proposal, the title of Part 65 would be amended to reflect the removal of Subparts D (Mechanics) and E (Repairmen)
from this part. The proposal would amend the title of Part 65 by revising the title of the part and would specifically
list airmen whose certification would continue to be regulated by this part. The title would be changed from ``Certification:

Section 65.1 currently states that Part 65 is applicable to air traffic control tower operators, aircraft dispatchers,
mechanics, repairmen, and parachute riggers. Under the proposal, certification of mechanics and repairmen (aviation
maintenance technicians and aviation repair specialists under the proposed rule would be regulated by Part 66. The

Currently, &sect;65.11(d)(2) prohibits a person whose repairman or mechanic certificate is revoked from applying
for either of those kinds of certificates for 1 year after the date of revocation, unless the order of revocation provides
otherwise. Because the proposal would place the certification of all mechanics and repairmen under Part 66, this
paragraph would be removed from Part 65; an equivalent paragraph, &sect;66.11(d), has been proposed for inclusion

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed &sect;66.71 is based upon the current &sect;65.71 and differs from that section solely in the language
of subparagraph (a)(2). The proposal differs from current &sect;65.71, because in addition to requiring an applicant
for an aviation maintenance technician certificate to read, write, speak, and understand the English language,
as is currently required, it would require the applicant to demonstrate this knowledge by reading and explaining
appropriate maintenance publications and by writing defect and repair statements. The proposal also differs from
the current section in that it would eliminate the issuance of certificates to individuals who cannot meet this requirement
and who are employed solely outside the United States by a U.S. air carrier.

The proposed &sect;66.81, based on current &sect;65.81, would define the privileges and limitations of a certificate
holder under this part. The proposed revision to the current privileges and limitations of certificate holders would
clarify and expand the manner in which an aviation maintenance technician may become qualified to supervise the maintenance,
preventive maintenance, or alteration of any aircraft, or approve and return to service any aircraft or appliance,
or part thereof, for which that person is rated. The proposal would provide the holder of an aviation maintenance technician
certificate with additional means to qualify for the exercise of these privileges. In addition to the means specified
in the current &sect;65.81, the holder may exercise the privileges mentioned above if the aviation maintenance technician
has received the equipment-specific training or has performed the work under the direct supervision of a certificated
and appropriately rated aviation maintenance technician or certificated aviation repair specialist who has also
received equipment-specific training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposal would clarify &sect;65.81 by permitting the holder of an aviation maintenance technician
certificate to exercise the privileges of the certificate and ratings by demonstrating the ability to perform the
work to the satisfaction of the Administrator. The current regulation requires actual performance of the work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation would require that the work recognized under proposed &sect;66.81 be performed after the
individual has been certificated as an aviation maintenance technician. Work performed while an individual is in
training for certification as an aviation maintenance technician may not necessarily be of the same quality required
for the return to service of an article, and therefore would not be credited toward satisfying the requirements specified
in &sect;66.81.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also would require that a certificated aviation maintenance technician understand all current maintenance
instructions (as opposed to maintenance manuals) for the specific operation concerned in order to exercise the privileges
of the certificate and rating.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed &sect;66.83 would prescribe the specific currency requirements for aviation maintenance technicians.
This proposed section is based on current &sect;65.83, Recent experience requirements. The proposal would provide
the holder of an aviation maintenance technician certificate with additional means to maintain the currency required
to exercise the privileges of the certificate and ratings. In addition to the means currently specified in &sect;65.83(a),
the proposal would allow the aviation maintenance technician to maintain the currency required to exercise the privileges
of the certificate, if the person served as an aviation maintenance instructor under an aviation maintenance training
program acceptable to the Administrator, directly supervised other aviation maintenance instructors, who are
serving under an aviation maintenance training program acceptable to the Administrator, or served under the supervision
of a certificated aviation maintenance technician. The proposal also would allow the use of any combination of the
proposed and current methods to maintain currency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would create a new subparagraph that would require the successful completion of refresher training
or training appropriate to the duties of an aviation maintenance technician if the individual desires to exercise
the privileges of the certificate or ratings for compensation or hire. The refresher training may consist of an aviation
maintenance technician refresher course, an inspection authorization course, or a series of courses, acceptable
to the Administrator, of not less than 16 hours of instruction. Training appropriate to the work to be performed must
also be acceptable to the Administrator and consist of not less than 16 hours of instruction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would not require all aviation maintenance technicians to complete the new training requirements.
An aviation maintenance technician, who within the preceding 24 months exercised the privileges of the certificate
and ratings for a certificate holder authorized to operate under the provisions of Parts 121, 127, 135, or for a U.S.-certificated
repair station that performed work in accordance with &sect;145.2(a) or conducted a maintenance and preventive
maintenance training program, would not be subject to the proposed training requirements. Additionally, aviation
maintenance instructors teaching under an aviation maintenance training program that is acceptable to the Administrator
need not complete the proposed training requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal sets forth an additional provision that would permit the aviation maintenance technician to exercise
the privileges of the certificate for compensation or hire if the certificate holder successfully completes a requalification
course acceptable to the Administrator.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed &sect;&sect;66.85, 66.87, 66.89, and 66.91 are based on current &sect;&sect;65.85, 65.87, 65.89,
and 65.91, respectively. These sections refer to the additional privileges of the airframe rating, the powerplant
rating, the display of certificates, and the inspection authorization, respectively. There are no substantive
difference between these proposed sections for Part 66 and current corresponding sections in Part 65.

Section 66.92 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed &sect;66.92 prescribes the duration of an inspection authorization. This proposed section is based
on &sect;65.92 of the current FAR. There is one substantive difference between the proposed section and the current
&sect;65.92. Under the proposal, the expiration date of the inspection authorization would be extended to March
31 of the second year after its issuance. Under the current regulation, the inspection authorization expires on March
31 of each year.

Section 66.93 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed &sect;66.93 prescribed the renewal procedures for an inspection authorization and is based on current
&sect;65.93. The proposed section would extend the inspection authorization renewal requirement to every 2 years
so that it would corresponds to the extension of the inspection authorization as proposed in &sect;66.92 above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would permit the holder of an inspection authorization to use a combination of annual inspections, inspections
of major repairs on major alterations, and progressive inspections to satisfy the renewal requirements for the inspection
authorization. Participation in current inspection programs recommended by the manufacturer of other inspection
programs established by the registered owner or operator under &sect;91.409(f)(3) or (4) now also may be used to satisfy
renewal requirements. To better facilitate the combination of these inspections, the proposal would change the
currently specified 90-day period to a 3-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulation, the holder of an inspection authorization may renew the authorization by attending
and successfully completing a refresher course of not less than 8 hours, acceptable to the Administrator, during
the 12-month period preceding the application for renewal. Because the proposal would change the duration of the
inspection authorization to 24 months, the proposal would require that an inspection authorization refresher course
or series of course consisting of a total of not less than 16 hours be taken in the 24 months preceding the application
for renewal. The proposed rule does not change the total amount of instruction the applicant must complete in the 24-month
preceding the application for renewal. The proposed rule also differs from the current regulation in that it only
requires successful completion (as opposed to attendance and successful completion) of an inspection authorization
refresher course. The proposal recognizes recent developments in instructional techniques and permits instruction
methods, acceptable to the Administrator, that may differ from the standard classroom or lecture format.

Section 66.101

The proposed &sect;66.101 would prescribe the general eligibility requirements for the aviation repair specialist
certificate. This proposed section is based on current &sect;65.101. The proposal would specify the current 18-month
experience requirement in hours instead of months. The 3,000 hours of experience specified in the proposal approximately
equal the current full-time 18-month experience requirement.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal differs from the current &sect;65.101 in the language of paragraph (a)(6). The proposal would not only
require an applicant for an aviation repair specialist certificate to read, write, speak, and understand the English
language, as is currently required, but also would require the applicant to demonstrate this knowledge by reading
and explaining appropriate maintenance publications and by writing defect and repair statements. The proposal
also differs from the current section in that it would eliminate the issuance of certificates to individuals who cannot
meet this requirement and who are employed solely outside the United States by a certificated U.S. repair station,
a certificated U.S. commercial operator, or a certificated U.S. air carrier. The language in this portion of the proposed
rule corresponds with the language proposed in &sect;66.71(a)(2), which similarly amends the eligibility requirements
for the aviation maintenance technician certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal adds to this section paragraph (c), which establishes the equivalency of the current repairman certificate
and the proposed aviation repair specialist certificate. The proposal also provides for the exchange of corresponding
certificates and ratings.

respectively. These sections refer to aviation repair specialist certificate privileges and limitations, the
experimental aircraft builder privileges and limitations, and the display of certificates, respectively. There
are no substantive differences between these proposed sections for Part 66 and current corresponding sections in

Regulatory Evaluation Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 dated September 30, 1993, directs Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations and maintain
current regulations only if they are required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary by a
``compelling public need.'' The order also requires that agencies assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and select the alternative that maximizes the net benefits and imposes the least burden on society.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the order requires agencies to submit a list of all rules, except those specifically exempted by the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) because they respond to emergency situations or other narrowly
defined exigencies, to determine whether any rule is a ``significant regulatory action.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Significant regulatory action'' means an action that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) have an annual effect
on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities;
(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the
principles set forth in the Executive Order. A ``significant regulatory action'' is submitted for centralized regulatory
review by OIRA. OIRA and the FAA have determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section contains the benefits and costs analyzed in the preliminary regulatory evaluation. In addition, it
includes an initial regulatory flexibility determination required by the 1980 Regulatory Flexibility Act and an
international trade impact assessment. The complete regulatory evaluation, which contains more detailed economic
information that this summary provides, is available in the docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule change would revise the regulations that prescribe the certification and training requirements
for mechanics and repairmen. The proposal would enhance the professionalism of the aviation maintenance workforce
by expanding the means for aviation maintenance personnel to satisfy training, experience, and currency requirements.
Employers would also benefit from the increased supply of potential employees who are expected to maintain their
currency because of the wider range of options for achieving this objective that would be permitted under the proposal.
Another benefit for employers is expected to be an increase in the quality of new hires, thereby lessening the need
for initial training to assure that these employees have basic skills and knowledge. Recurrent training is also expected
to assist aviation maintenance personnel in staying abreast of the rapid changes in technology that are expected
to occur. The expected magnitude of these benefits cannot be quantified with any certainty, however, because of their
intangible nature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only one of the provisions would impose significant costs on the industry. This provision would require mechanics
who use their certificates for compensation or hire to receive refresher or requalification training. At present,
certified mechanics working under Parts 121, 127, and 135 and &sect;145.2(a) must be fully informed about procedures,
techniques, and new equipment in use through participation in maintenance and preventive maintenance training
programs. These mechanics are, therefore, already in compliance with the proposed rule. This proposed requirement
for recurrent training would primarily affect those mechanics who work on general aviation aircraft rather than
aircraft used by the air carriers. The FAA estimates that this proposed rule would affect from 14,000 to 23,000 mechanics
of a total workforce of about 145,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Taking an Aviation Maintenance Technician (AMT) refresher courts, an inspection authorization refresher course,
or a series of such courses that are acceptable to the Administrator, would satisfy the requirements of this proposed
rule. However, the course or courses taken within a 2-year time period must consist of a total of not less than 16 hours
of instruction. This training may be broad based or narrowly focused but must be acceptable to the Administrator.
For example, courses dealing with general maintenance practices of regulations applicable to maintenance operations
as well as equipment-specific training would be acceptable. Some home study or video courses may also be acceptable
for fulfilling this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that the total expected cost of recurrent training over a 10-year period would range between $37.28
million and $66.53 million on an undiscounted basis and between $25.94 million and $46.48 million on a discounted
basis. The midpoints of these ranges are $51.91 million (undiscounted) and $36.21 million (discounted).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bulk of the expected benefits are expected to accrue from productivity gains. Productivity is expected to increase
because recurrent training in troubleshooting techniques or general maintenance practices should reduce the amount
of time required to diagnose problems and lower the incidence of unnecessary repairs, which inflate repair costs.
The lack of information regarding the prevalence of inefficient or ineffective repairs makes it difficult to project
the potential magnitude of the benefits expected to result from this factor. The adoption of the conservative assumption
that productivity would increase by only .5 percent per year, however, would result in an annualized benefit range
(undiscounted) of $4.17 million to $6.39 million, the midpoint of which ($5.28 million) would exceed the expected
magnitude of undiscounted annual costs, making the rule change cost beneficial.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Administrative cost savings are expected to add to the benefits. The most substantial component of these savings
should result from reducing the current annual requirement for IA renewal to a biennial one. The FAA estimates that
these cost savings for the FAA would amount to $.71 million on a discounted basis over a 10-year period. A provision
that would allow mechanics to substitute a requalification course for the requirement to work at least 6 months over
the previous 2 years in order to maintain one's currency would benefit employers by not only increasing the pool of
available qualified mechanics, but also by saving them the administrative costs involved in checking an applicant's
qualifications for the job. These benefits could not be quantified.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congres to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules which may
have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Small entities include businesses,
nonprofit organizations, and government jurisdictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation will affect individuals only and is, therefore, not expected to have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small businesses.

International Trade Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would have a negligible impact on trade opportunities for U.S. firms doing business overseas or
on foreign firms doing business in the United States. The proposed rule primarily affects individuals, not businesses
involved in the sale of aviation products or services.

Federalism Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation proposed herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination
and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not a significant
regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this proposal, if adopted, would
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the
criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered significant under DOT Order 2100.5,
Policies and Procedures for Simplification, Analysis, and Review of Regulations. A draft regulatory evaluation
of the proposal, including an initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and International Trade Impact Analysis,
has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission today is proposing amendments to its rules and forms regarding the filing of ownership reports by officers,
directors, and principal security holders, and the exemption of certain transactions by those persons from the short-swing
profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') and related provisions
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act'') and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
The proposed rules are intended to streamline the Section 16 regulatory scheme, particularly with respect to employee
benefit plans; broaden exemptions from short-swing profit recovery where consistent with the statutory purposes;
and codify several staff interpretive positions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In February 1991, in response to developments in the trading of derivative securities, the growth of complex and diverse
employee benefit plans, and substantial filing delinquencies, the Commission adopted extensive changes to the
beneficial ownership and short-swing profit recovery rules and forms applicable to insiders
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 pursuant to Section 16.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After three years of experience, unanticipated practical difficulties still arise in applying the new Section 16
rules, particularly with respect to thrift and similar employee benefit plans.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rule changes proposed today address these practical problems and further streamline the rules, to the extent
consistent with the purposes of Section 16.

Release No. 34&hyph;28869 (February 8, 1991) [56 FR 7242] (``Adopting Release''). The rules generally became effective
on May 1, 1991, except for the phase-in period for compliance with the substantive conditions of new Rule 16b-3. The
phase-in period has been extended until September 1, 1995 or such different date as may be set in further rulemaking
(Release No. 34&hyph;34513 (August 10, 1994)).

Following the Adopting Release, the Commission issued two other releases relating to the revised rules; one set forth
the Commission's interpretive views regarding shareholder approval for amendments to employee benefit plans under
Rule 16b&hyph;3, as well as certain technical amendments (Release No. 34&hyph;29131 (April 26, 1991) [56 FR 19925]),
while the other adopted a technical amendment to Form 4 (Release No. 34&hyph;28869B (April 10, 1991) [56 FR 14467]).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Employee Benefit Plan Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The focus of the proposed rules is the treatment of employee benefit plan transactions. In particular, the proposals
would: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exempt from short-swing profit recovery all purchase transactions in thrift and other broad-based, tax-qualified
plans, other than those involving transfers to and from an employer securities fund; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exempt from short-swing profit recovery transfers to and from employer securities funds in thrift and other plans
that are effected either during a quarterly window period or pursuant to a diversification election under the Internal
Revenue Code; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Expand exemptions for plan distributions in connection with retirement or specified transactions authorized by
the Internal Revenue Code; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provide that exempt dispositions within six months of an exempt grant would not destroy the exemption for the grant;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' cash-only instruments issued as compensation by an employer
to an employee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' rights that include non-market price based conditions;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' rights to withhold (or to deliver securities already owned)
to satisfy tax or exercise price obligations, and exempt cash settlement of such rights where granted pursuant to
exempt employee benefit plans; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Eliminate the transferability restrictions applicable to derivative securities issued under an employee
benefit plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also would simplify and clarify the reporting requirements by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permitting joint and group reporting where more than one person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Providing that Section 16 applies to a trust only if the trust beneficially owns more than ten percent of a class of registered
equity securities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eliminating officers' and directors' post-termination reporting obligations with respect to exempt transactions
and other transactions that are not matchable with a pre-termination transaction; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring a discrete caption for the disclosure about delinquent Section 16(a) reports required by Item 405 of Regulations
S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Release also solicits comment on a variety of approaches to simplify the reporting of exempt transactions, including
elimination of the total holdings column in Forms 4 and 5, proposals to replace Form 5 with alternative reporting schemes
(including a Form 10&hyph;K summary of insider transactions), and elimination of the requirement to report exempt
employee benefit plan transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposal would codify certain staff interpretive positions, and would establish new categories of
transactions exempt from short-swing recovery by:

A. Expanded Exemptions for Broad-Based Plan Transactions and Intra-Plan Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal objection raised to the amended Section 16 rules has been that the treatment of thrift, stock purchase
and other broad-based, tax-qualified plans is unduly cumbersome, presents significant record-keeping problems,
and discourages insiders from participation in plan funds holding employer securities. These plans are subject
to significant restrictions under both the Internal Revenue Code
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the Employee Income Retirement Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA''),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which establish an objective framework for the treatment of compensatory transactions and impose extensive administrative
requirements, thereby making plan transactions less vulnerable to the abuses that the short-swing recovery provision
of Section 16(b) was designed to prevent. Accordingly, the proposed rules would streamline the conditions necessary
to exempt transactions in such plans from short-swing profit recovery. Comment is solicited not only on the proposals
set forth, but also on whether there is any other aspect of the treatment of employee benefit plans that should be modified,
either in Rule 16b&hyph;3 or any other rule relating to employee transactions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed below, the revised rule would exempt, without conditions as to timing, any purchase transaction arising
under a broad-based nondiscriminatory tax-qualified plan, other than an intra-plan transfer to or from an employer
securities fund.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed exemption would have a broader scope than the current rule, since it would be available not only to participant-directed
contributory plans, but also would apply specifically to related ``excess benefit'' or ``mirror'' plans and noncontributory
plans such as many employee stock ownership plans (``ESOPs'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The timing restrictions governing the exemption for transfers to or from an employer stock fund in any thrift, stock
purchase or similar plan, whether or not broad-based, nondiscriminatory and tax-qualified, would be more flexible.

Proposed Rule 16b&hyph;3(d) would replace Rule 16b&hyph;3(d)(2) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(d)(2)] in its entirety.
Other transactional exemptions currently available to participant-directed plans would continue to be available.
Current Rules 16b&hyph;3(d)(1)(i) and (ii) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(d)(1)(i) and (ii)] are proposed to be moved to
Rules 16b&hyph;3(h) and (g), respectively. See Sections II.B. and II.H, below.

16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters are requested to address whether it is necessary to limit the proposed purchase exemption to plans that
are qualified pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. Are the conditions of the proposed rule that a plan be broad-based
and non-discriminatory sufficient safeguards? Does satisfaction of the minimum participation, minimum funding,
non-discrimination and vesting standards specifically imposed by the Internal Revenue Code provide additional
assurance that transactions pursuant to a plan will not be subject to abuse? Is the proposed exemption for excess benefit
plan transactions consistent with the theory that wide participation and equal treatment of all participating employees
limits insiders' opportunities to engage in short-swing speculation?

2. Intra-Plan Transfers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would simplify and shorten the timing restriction that conditions the exemption for transfers
of funds in an employee plan to or from an employer securities fund (``fund-switching transaction''). As proposed,
any fund-switching transaction effected pursuant to an election made during any quarterly ``window period'' would
be exempt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Moreover, the exemption no longer would be limited to transfers at least six months apart. The requirement that the
election occur in the ``window period'' following the release of quarterly and annual financial data should provide
an adequate safeguard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As under the current rules, the exemption would be available whether or not the plan is broad-based, tax-qualified
and nondiscriminatory.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
28
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Finally, because of changes to the basic exemption for plan purchases discussed above, transferring assets out of
an employer securities fund would no longer trigger the requirement that the insider cease plan purchases for six
months.

Comment is requested as to whether the six month timing restriction between transfers should be retained, and, if
so, whether it should be limited to opposite way transactions, such as a transfer into an employer securities fund
followed by a transfer out of an employer securities fund. In addition, commenters should address whether requiring
that transactions be limited to every other window period, even if separated by a few days less than six months_rather
than requiring the transactions themselves to be six months apart_would alleviate difficulties in administering
the requirement while preventing opportunities for speculative abuse. Comment also is requested whether it would
be consistent with the statutory purpose to exempt fund-switching transactions without any timing restrictions.
In addressing these issues, commenters are asked to consider the manner in which the rule, as proposed, would function
in tandem with concurrently applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA regarding transfers.

Commenters' attention is directed particularly to the rules that became effective January 1, 1994 under Section
404(c) of ERISA [29 USC 1104(c)] that specify circumstances in which employee plan sponsors will not be subject to
fiduciary responsibility because investment decisions are made by plan participants. In order to benefit from the
rules, a plan must make a variety of investment vehicles available to plan participants and permit participants to
switch their investments among the different vehicles at a rate of frequency related to the volatility of the investment.
The latter requirement may dictate that a plan permit fund-switching transactions more frequently than every six
months.

In addition, the proposed rule would exempt any fund-switching transaction that results from a diversification

restriction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

C. Compensatory Cash-Only Instruments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rules, the derivative security definition would be modified to provide a more expansive exclusion
for compensatory instruments that can be redeemed or exercised solely for cash (``cash-only instruments''),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
36
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 such as phantom stock. The proposed exclusion would apply to all cash-only instruments issued in the context of an
employer-employee compensation arrangement,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 including compensation arrangements between a company and its non-employee directors.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
38
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Historically the purpose of such plans has been to provide performance-based cash compensation to employees, using
stock price as a measure of company performance, rather than to provide employees with an equity interest in the employer.

Commentators have cited a number of problems with using these types of performance-based plans arising from the 1991
rule changes. For example, change-in-control provisions and hardship withdrawal provisions could render the current
exclusion unavailable because the rights would not be redeemable only on a fixed date or dates at least six months following
the award. Given the difficulties that have arisen, and recognizing the historic role of stock return as a measure
for long-term cash-based incentive plans, the proposals would restore these plans to a status similar to that which
existed pre-1991.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment is requested on the necessity or appropriateness of the proposed exclusion for compensatory cash-only instruments.
Is there any basis for according disparate treatment, for reporting and/or short-swing profit purposes, to equity-based
securities depending on whether they are settled exclusively in cash or stock (or in either stock or cash), where both
types of derivative securities provide identical opportunities for profit predicated on the underlying stock price
movement? Commenters should focus in particular on the need for retention of one or both of the current, alternative
conditions to the availability of the exclusion (compliance with specified requirements of Rule 16b&hyph;3; fixed-date
redemption or exercise).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Alternatively, should the current exclusion for cash-only instruments be retained, with some relief provided for
hardship withdrawals or other specified exceptions? What impact, if any, would the proposed exclusion have on executive
and director stock-ownership programs that seek to align shareholder and managerial interests through awards of
issuer stock or derivative securities payable in stock?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Numerous interpretive questions, particularly in the employee benefit area, have been raised concerning the treatment
of performance units and similar instruments as derivative securities. To provide clarification, the proposed
rules would revise the definition of derivative security to codify the staff interpretive view that an instrument
is not within the scope of Section 16 if it includes a material non-market price based condition (such as return on equity)
to exercise or settlement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
42
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As proposed, rights under which benefits are subject to a material condition (other than the passage of time or continued
employment) not tied to the market price of an equity security of the issuer would be excluded from the definition of
derivative security for purposes of Section 16.

E. Surrender and Withholding Rights in Connection With Exercise or Tax Withholding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Employee benefit plans commonly provide participants with the right to have securities withheld, or to deliver securities
already owned, either in payment of the exercise price of an option or to satisfy the tax withholding consequences
of an option exercise or the vesting of restricted securities. While a tax withholding right currently is treated
as a derivative security separate from the equity or derivative security to which it relates,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
44
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it appears that this right, as well as the right to have securities withheld in satisfaction of an exercise price, properly
may be viewed as an integral feature of the related security.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
45
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Accordingly, a newly proposed rule would exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' these withholding
rights, as well as rights to surrender previously owned securities in satisfaction of either a tax obligation or an
exercise price.

Today, when withholding rights are exercised or securities delivered, the exemptive treatment of the exercise transactions
differs, depending on whether securities are withheld by or tendered to the employer. The delivery of previously
owned shares with respect to shares of the same class is exempt without further conditions except for compliance with

Rule 16b&hyph;3(e) would be amended to delete the clause that deems the cash settlement of a tax withholding right
to be a stock appreciation right. Rule 16b&hyph;3(f)(2) would be amended to exempt withholding by the issuer, as well
as surrender or delivery to the issuer, of shares of its stock as payment for the exercise of a derivative security.
Similarly, proposed Rule 16b&hyph;3(f)(3) would be added to exempt the cash settlement of a tax withholding right,
either by withholding shares or the surrender of shares previously owned. The tax withholding right could be in connection
with an option exercise or the vesting of restricted shares. Transaction Code F would continue to be used for withholding
transactions, and would be expanded to cover the withholding and surrender of securities in connection with the vesting
of restricted shares. Proposed Rule 16b&hyph;3(f)(3) would be substituted for current Rule 16b&hyph;3(f)(3) [17
CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(f)(3)], which would be replaced substantively by proposed Rule 16b&hyph;5(b), as discussed

The current rule requires the issuer of the stock appreciation right to have been subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act for at least a year prior to the transaction, and to have filed all reports and statements
thereby required. Under the proposal, a one-year reporting history no longer would be required. Instead, the issuer
simply would have to have filed all required reports and statements for a year prior to the transaction, or such shorter
time as the issuer had been subject to Section 13(a).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two amendments are proposed to the exemption of grant and award transactions based on disinterested administration
of the employee benefit plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
51
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 First, the provision that permits a director to remain disinterested although he or she elects to receive in securities
``an annual retainer fee'' would be changed to permit receipt of ``a director's fee,'' thus broadening the term to
clarify that a meeting fee or other director's fee would be included.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
52
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Second, the requirement that the securities elected to be received constitute an ``equivalent amount'' to the cash
would be deleted.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
53
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The current requirement could impair companies' ability to provide directors with an adequate incentive to elect
the receipt of compensation in securities. Comment is requested, however, as to whether some limitation should remain
in order to assure that the director's receipt of stock is adequately linked to the fee, rather than a separate stock
grant.

2. Formula Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assure that objective criteria govern the making of awards under formula plans, the rule currently requires that
the plan itself restrict the frequency with which the terms of the formula may be amended to not more than once every
six months, with limited exceptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
54
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the proposal, no written restriction would need to be placed in the plan. Instead, the rule would require that
the plan not be amended periodically and in no event more often than every six months, with the same exceptions as currently
permitted.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
55
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, a reference to the automatic nature of a formula plan would be added to clarify that the rule does not permit
discretionary awards.

3. Six Month Holding Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal, the six-month holding period for securities obtained in a grant and award transaction would not
apply to securities disposed of in a transaction that is exempted by rule from Section 16(b), such as a bona fide gift.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
57
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, it is proposed that the six-month holding period for dividend equivalent rights (``DERs'') and shares
purchased pursuant to the reinvestment of dividends should be deemed to commence on the date of acquisition of the
shares on which the DERs or dividends are paid.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
58
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If adopted, should this treatment apply only to dividends and DERs paid at a rate that does not exceed dividends paid
on the issuer's common stock? Moreover, should this treatment be limited to dividends paid on a broadly held class
of securities, so that neither the timing nor the amount of dividend paid would be subject to manipulation by insiders?

H. Exemptions for Distributions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, distributions to plan participants of securities acquired in an exempt manner under Rule 16b&hyph;3
are also exempt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
59
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As proposed, this exemption would be broadened so it would apply to all distributions of plan securities, whether
those securities were acquired pursuant to Rule 16b&hyph;3, an exemption under the former rules, or in a nonexempt
manner.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
60
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such an exemption appears appropriate where these distributions merely change the form of the participant's beneficial
ownership, not its extent. Of course, if the participant then sells the securities, the sale would be subject to Section
16.

When a plan distributes the cash value of securities in participants' accounts, rather than the securities themselves,
such a distribution would be viewed as a sale. As proposed, the rule would expand the categories of exempt cash distributions
to plan participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, distributions of securities and cash, or the deferral of such distributions, incident to death, retirement,
disability or termination of employment, would be exempt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
61
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such distributions and deferrals currently are exempt if effected by means of a participant-directed election.

62
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order for a plan transaction to be exempt, the current rule requires that the plan set forth in writing the basis for
determining insider eligibility to participate, and either the price at which securities may be offered and the amount
of securities to be awarded or the method by which such price and amount are to be determined. Under the proposal,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
68
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

J. Transferability Restriction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the availability of exemptions is conditioned on a written specification, in the plan or other written
agreement, that a derivative security awarded under the plan may not be transferred by the participant other than
by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
70
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The restriction on transferability initially was derived from the Internal Revenue Code as a reflection of prior
business practice and was designed to limit opportunities for the speculative abuse of options.

Rule 16b&hyph;3(a)(2) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(a)(2)]. By interpretation, plans that are not subject to I.R.C. Section
401(a) have been allowed to permit transfers of derivative securities pursuant to ``domestic relations orders''
that satisfy the requirements of I.R.C. Sections 414(p)(1) (A) and (B).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, questions have been raised about whether this restriction needs to be retained, given the presence of other
safeguards in Rule 16b&hyph;3 and given the fact that the current Section 16 regulatory framework generally recognizes
economic parity between derivative securities and their underlying equity securities. Accordingly, the proposed
amendments to Rule 16b&hyph;3 would delete the transferability restriction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
71
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters are asked to address whether there is any continuing need for this restriction, either in whole or in part,
and should address the extent to which nontransferability may act as a safeguard, both in Rule 16b&hyph;3 and in the
context of compensatory cash-only instruments as discussed above.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Of course, in many cases transferability restrictions would continue to exist because of Internal Revenue Code requirements
or companies' policies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assuming the restriction is retained but modified, would it be appropriate to recast it as a transactional requirement,
so that only derivative securities for which the exemption is claimed would need to satisfy this requirement?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
72
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Comment also is solicited on whether, if the restriction is retained, additional kinds of transfers should be permitted,
such as transfers to family members of insiders, family partnerships, charitable institutions, and trusts whose
beneficiaries are insiders and their families, or transfers by a non-employee director to a third party entity (such
as the director's law firm) without consideration pursuant to an agreement that provides that any compensation received
for the director's services is received for the benefit of that entity. Comment also is solicited on whether the rule
should permit only transfers that are exempt from short-swing profit recovery, such as bona fide gifts.

Options that satisfy the transferability restrictions currently may be issued on an exempt basis pursuant to a plan

family trusts and family partnerships.

If transfers to family members and family entities are permitted, should these be limited to transfers for estate

 and any subsequent disposition by the transferee would be attributed to the insider? Finally, comment is solicited
on the combined effect of liberalizing or eliminating transferability restrictions and the proposal, discussed
above, to provide that securities obtained in an exempt grant may be disposed of within six months if the disposition
is a gift or otherwise exempt from short-swing profit recovery. Should the rules provide that the six-month holding
period would continue to run in the hands of the transferee?

A. Reporting of Exempt Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is reconsidering its approach to the reporting of transactions pursuant to the Section 16 regulatory
scheme. Under the current rules, transactions exempt from short-swing profit recovery (other than exempt exercises
and conversions of derivative securities) must be reported annually.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Reporting of exempt transactions has been required to provide interested parties with the opportunity to evaluate
insiders' claims to exemptions; facilitate reconciliation of insiders' holdings at the end of the fiscal year; and
provide indications of insiders' views of their corporations' prospects, although annual reporting generally
is permitted since these transactions are viewed as having less potential than non-exempt transactions to reflect
insiders' investment assessments of their corporations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has received various suggestions that would further streamline Section 16(a) reporting. These proposals
seek to simplify reporting through different basic approaches. One approach would delete or substantially reduce
the reporting of exempt transactions. A second approach would not reduce significantly the reportable transactions,
but rather would reduce the flexibility provided insiders with respect to using Form 4 or Form 5 to report a number of
exempt transactions. A third approach would introduce issuer annual reporting of insider holdings and information
as to transactions during the fiscal year. These proposals highlight several questions as to what extent, if at all,
investors need information with respect to exempt transactions and whether investors need a reconciliation of insiders'
equity holdings from year to year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suggestions received by the Commission include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Elimination of the requirement to report exempt transactions, or certain classes of exempt transactions, such
as exempt employee benefit plan transactions;

Many of these transactions currently may be reported on an aggregated basis, as of the most recent date for which plan
information is available. Aggregated reporting also is permitted, by staff interpretation, for acquisitions and
holdings resulting from reinvestment of dividends or interest in exempt transactions, and acquisitions of dividend
equivalent rights in exempt employee benefit plan transactions.

5. Elimination of the total holdings column in Forms 4 and 5 (which the current rules limit to the class of securities
with respect to which a transaction is reported), or simplification of the reconciling data for such columns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is interested in obtaining the least burdensome reporting system that will effectively achieve the
disclosure purposes of Section 16(a), and therefore solicits comment on each of the above proposals. While the above
changes are not included in the text of the proposals published today, the Commission may adopt any of the alternatives
specified above, or a combination of those alternatives, and also may in the final rule amendments incorporate any
one or more of the approaches discussed above. Comment is solicited as to whether each of these suggested changes would
simplify the reporting obligations on insiders without materially reducing the flow of information that is significant
to investors. If the total holdings column is retained, comment also is requested as to whether any reconciling information
could be eliminated. Additionally, comment is solicited as to whether a new column should be added to Forms 4 and 5 requiring
insiders to reconcile their current holdings with those reported on the previous report. Would this reconciliation
requirement be appropriate only if reporting of exempt transactions were eliminated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, commenters recommending the elimination of Form 5 should address the mechanism by which information
that currently is reportable only on an annual basis should be reported. Commenters also are asked to address whether
Form 5 has continuing usefulness in reducing reporting delinquencies, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
76
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and, if so, what mechanism could serve this purpose if Form 5 were rescinded. In particular, what mechanism would enable
issuers to determine, in connection with their disclosure obligations under Item 405 of Regulation S&hyph;K and
S&hyph;B, whether all required Section 16(a) reports had been filed?

Although the current reporting scheme generally requires transactions exempt from short-swing profit recovery

Finally, a new transaction code K would be added to Forms 4 and 5 to report any transaction that changes only the form
of beneficial ownership and not the extent of a reporting person's pecuniary interest in the subject securities.
Such transactions are reportable on Form 5, but the code also would be added to Form 4 so it could be used for voluntary
reporting on that form. Comment is requested as to whether any additional codes need to be added, or whether any existing
codes may be deleted, consistent with the informational needs of persons who use Section 16(a) disclosure.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At present, small acquisitions of equity securities and exercises and conversions of derivative securities are
reported on an insider's next otherwise required Form 4 or Form 5, whichever is earlier.
<FOOTCITE>79</FOOTCITE>
 No change currently is proposed to the existing system of reporting these transactions, other than amendment of the
small acquisitions reporting rule
<FOOTCITE>80</FOOTCITE>
 to exclude from the $10,000 threshold acquisitions occurring within the prior six months of the current acquisition
that were exempted by rule from Section 16(b) or previously reported on Form 4 or 5, and to clarify that the current acquisition
cannot be disregarded in calculating the $10,000 threshold. Comment also is solicited as to whether reporting would
be made more convenient for insiders, consistent with the informational needs of other investors, by permitting
small acquisitions and exempt exercises and conversions to be reported solely on Form 5; or by providing that small
acquisitions be reported on Form 5 and exempt exercises and conversions be reported on Form 4.

The timing for reporting exercises and conversions was expedited from the proposed annual reporting in response
to commenters' concerns, particularly the concerns of individual investors that option exercises represent important
indicia of insiders' views of their companies' prospects. If a derivative security is exercised or converted before
its exempt grant otherwise must be reported, the grant should be reported at the same time as the exercise or conversion.

Currently, when an insider exercises an option acquired pursuant to a Rule 16b&hyph;3 plan and immediately sells
a portion of the shares to pay the exercise price under a cashless exercise program, the transaction generally is reported
on Form 4 or 5 as the exercise of a derivative security and sale of a non-derivative security.
<FOOTCITE>81</FOOTCITE>
 Comment is solicited as to whether insiders should be either required or permitted to reflect the sale of the portion
of shares necessary to satisfy the exercise price by using the transaction code for payment of an option exercise price
by delivery or withholding of securities,
<FOOTCITE>82</FOOTCITE>
 rather than the general sale of security code currently used, since all of these transactions constitute cashless
exercises. In addition, comment is solicited as to whether this transaction code also should be used in connection
with the exercise of stock appreciation rights.

Currently, when more than one person subject to Section 16 is deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same equity securities,

Under the proposal, where persons in a group have reporting obligations, the filing of collective reports on behalf
of all group members would be permitted.
<FOOTCITE>84</FOOTCITE>
 Such joint and group filings, and any amendments, could be submitted by any designated constituent beneficial owner.
Required information would have to be given for each beneficial owner, and such filings would have to be signed by,
or on behalf of, each beneficial owner by an authorized person, with statements confirming the delegation of signature
authority attached to the filing. Beneficial owners making a joint or group filing could authorize one of the beneficial
owners or a third party to sign on their behalf, provided that confirming statements are attached to the filing, or
are provided by amendment as soon as practicable, with respect to each owner delegating signature authority, unless
such a confirmation still in effect is on file with the Commission.
<FOOTCITE>85</FOOTCITE>
 Of course, to the extent a sufficiently broad power of attorney previously had been filed, such as with a Schedule 13D,
that power of attorney could be incorporated by reference in a Section 16(a) filing. Each beneficial owner would,
of course, retain individual liability for compliance with the filing requirements, including the obligation to
assure that the filing is timely and accurately made.
<FOOTCITE>86</FOOTCITE>
 Comment is solicited as to whether, in the alternative, authority to make a group Section 16 filing could be presumed
based on the filing of a group Schedule 13D,
<FOOTCITE>87</FOOTCITE>
 such that all group members thereby would be deemed to have granted authority to any group member to file a Section 16
form.

Joint and group filings could be used, for example, by parents and subsidiaries, partnerships, or Schedule 13D groups
[17 CFR 240.13d&hyph;101]. The group itself is not a reporting person for Section 16 purposes; however, under the
proposed rules, group members could choose to file collective reports to satisfy their individual filing obligations.
A group member is not required to report transactions by another group member, however, unless he or she has or shares
a pecuniary interest in the securities acquired or disposed of by such other member.

D. Trust Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today, a trust is subject to Section 16 not only if it beneficially owns more than ten percent of a class of registered
equity securities,
<FOOTCITE>88</FOOTCITE>
 but also if the trustee otherwise is an insider and has investment control over the issuer's securities held by the
trust, and the trustee or a member of the trustee's immediate family has a pecuniary interest in such securities, except
in limited circumstances. This dual standard, newly established under the rules adopted in 1991, created a new reporting
obligation for some trusts, particularly family trusts where the insiders already were required to report most of
the trust transactions involved.

Since the primary effect of the new standard was to create duplicative reporting obligations, imposing independent
Section 16 obligations on the trusts does not appear necessary. Accordingly, the proposed rules would eliminate
these overlapping obligations by subjecting a trust to Section 16 only if it holds more than ten percent of a class of
registered equity securities of the issuer.

E. Post-Termination Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current rules, any transaction following the cessation of director or officer status is required to be reported,
if executed within six months of a transaction that occurred while the person was a director or officer. However, it
appears that the record-keeping burdens of tracking post-termination transactions should be imposed only with
respect to those transactions where short-swing profit liability is likely. Accordingly, the proposal would eliminate
insiders' post-termination reporting obligations with respect to post-termination transactions that are exempt
and thus not subject to matching with pre-termination transactions.
<FOOTCITE>92</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, a post-termination transaction would not be required to be reported unless it occurred within six months
of an opposite (purchase vs. sale), non-exempt transaction that was effected while the reporting person was an officer
or director.
<FOOTCITE>93</FOOTCITE>
 Comment is requested as to the continuing need to report these transactions. In particular, is it necessary to continue
to require reporting of exempt post-termination transactions to assure that an exemption properly may be claimed?

F. Compliance With the Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the adoption of the 1991 revisions to the Section 16 rules and forms, including issuer disclosure concerning
insider compliance and annual reporting of exempt transactions, compliance with Section 16(a) reporting obligations
generally has improved substantially.
<FOOTCITE>94</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Commission does not propose to change the disclosure requirements of Item 405 of Regulations S&hyph;B
and S&hyph;K, which requires issuer disclosure concerning insider compliance with these reporting obligations,
except that registrants would be required to set off any disclosure of non-compliance under an appropriate and discrete
caption.
<FOOTCITE>95</FOOTCITE>
 This should enable interested parties to locate quickly this disclosure, which often consists of only a sentence
or two, and to prevent it from being buried among unrelated disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
During 1990, the year before the new rules were adopted, approximately 21 percent of the reportable market transactions
were reported more than three days following the due date. From May 1991 through March 1994, the comparable figure
was approximately five percent.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The caption would read: ``Section 16(a) Reporting Delinquencies.'' Additionally, a technical amendment to Item
405 of Regulation S&hyph;B would correct the reference to Rule 16a&hyph;3(d) [17 CFR 240.16a&hyph;3(d)] by replacing
it with a reference to Rule 16a&hyph;3(e) [17 CFR 240.16a&hyph;3(e)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, Item 405 would be revised to clarify the nature of the issuer's obligation to review insiders' filings
in order to determine whether there are any delinquent reports that must be disclosed. The issuer is entitled to rely
on the Forms 3, 4, and 5 furnished to it, as well as written representations by the insider that no Form 5 is required.
New language would be added to make it clear that the issuer is obligated to consider the absence of certain forms.
<FOOTCITE>96</FOOTCITE>
 The absence of a Form 3 from an insider is an indication that disclosure is required. Similarly, the absence of a Form
5 from an insider is an indication that disclosure is required, unless the issuer has received a written representation
that no Form 5 is required,
<FOOTCITE>97</FOOTCITE>
 or the issuer otherwise knows that no such filing is required.

Further, comment is solicited on whether Item 405 should be revised to require issuers to include in their filings
an affirmative statement that there were no Section 16(a) delinquencies required to be reported, if such is the case.
<FOOTCITE>98</FOOTCITE>
 It has been suggested that there are instances where required disclosures are not made because Item 405 is overlooked.
An affirmative statement of the absence of reportable delinquencies has been proposed to the Commission as a potential
tool for minimizing this problem. Commenters should address whether the problem suggested does in fact exist, and,
if so, whether the proposed solution would be effective.

If this requirement were adopted, registrants with no delinquencies to report would be permitted to use the caption
``Compliance with the Reporting Requirements of Section 16(a).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Commission is aware of and encourages the practice of many issuers to assist their officers and directors
in complying with their Section 16(a) reporting obligations. Since the use of powers of attorney is permitted, it
is also possible for an issuer to coordinate the filing of its officers' and directors' reports by having the corporate
secretary or other agent obtain powers of attorney from these reporting persons, and act on their behalf to collect
information every month about their transactions subject to Section 16 and make the filings by the due date.

G. Equity Swaps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Questions have been asked concerning the proper method of reporting equity swaps for purposes of Section 16. Equity
swaps are individually negotiated contracts in which the specific terms may vary from agreement to agreement. For
instance, an equity swap may take the form of an agreement in which one party holding shares of equity securities agrees
to pay, or ``swap,'' the return
<FOOTCITE>100</FOOTCITE>
 on those securities in exchange for the return on an equity index, basket of equities, or an interest rate-based cash
flow. Section 16 consequences would arise from such a transaction where either party to the transaction is a Section
16 insider with respect to a security to which the swap agreement relates.
<FOOTCITE>101</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
100
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this analysis, ``return'' may include dividends paid on the equity instrument, as well as change in
market value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
101
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
No Section 16 consequences would flow from the transaction to the extent that the swap relates solely to interests
in securities comprising part of a broad-based, publicly traded market basket or index of stocks, approved for trading
by the appropriate federal governmental authority, that are deemed not to confer beneficial ownership for purposes
of Section 16 pursuant to Rule 16a&hyph;1(a)(5)(iii) [17 CFR 240.16a&hyph;1(a)(5)(iii)] and/or are excluded from
the definition of ``derivative securities'' pursuant to Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(4) [17 CFR 240.16a&hyph;1(c)(4)].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to demonstrate how Section 16 would apply,
<FOOTCITE>102</FOOTCITE>
 assume that an insider agrees to pay to the counterparty for a period of three years the value of dividend payments on
100,000 shares of issuer common stock, in exchange for payment of a fixed interest rate based on the market value of
the 100,000 shares of stock at the commencement of the swap term. The parties also agree that at the end of the swap term,
the insider will pay to the counterparty the cash value of any appreciation on the shares during the term, or, conversely,
the counterparty will pay to the insider the cash value of any depreciation. The insider retains title to and any voting
rights in the securities.
<FOOTCITE>103</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
102
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This analysis addresses solely the application of Section 16 to these transactions to the extent that they are engaged
in by insiders. The discussion does not analyze the status of these transactions or the parties thereto under any other
provision of the federal securities laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
It is not necessary, however, that either party to any equity swap have direct ownership of the underlying equity securities,
index or basket. Rather, equity swaps may provide insiders with a synthetic means of realizing any changes in the value
of the equity securities to which the swap agreement relates. For example, an insider may engage in a swap in which the
insider contracts to receive any change in value of the issuer's common stock without making any direct investment
in such stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It appears that the following reporting scheme appropriately reflects the economic impact of the transaction on
the insider. The insider should report entering into the swap on Form 4 as (i) the sale or writing of a stock appreciation
right (``SAR''), and (ii) the purchase of a stock depreciation right (``SDR'').
<FOOTCITE>104</FOOTCITE>
 This result would reflect the fact that the insider has locked in the value of the 100,000 shares during the swap term
to the same extent as if the shares had been sold.
<FOOTCITE>105</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
104
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
If the counterparty is an insider, it would report the same swap as (i) the purchase of an SAR, and (ii) the sale or writing
of an SDR.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

The result would be a sale of the underlying securities pursuant to Rule 16b&hyph;6(a) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;6(a)]
because the insider engaging in the swap has an increase in a put equivalent position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The manner in which an insider reports the closing of the swap would depend on the change in price of the underlying securities
during the swap term.
<FOOTCITE>106</FOOTCITE>
 If the price increases, so that the insider must pay cash to the counterparty, the insider should report the exempt
expiration without value of the SDR.
<FOOTCITE>107</FOOTCITE>
 The insider also should report on Form 4 the exempt exercise by the counterparty of the SAR, the insider's exempt deemed
disposition of the underlying securities to the counterparty pursuant to the SAR, and the insider's non-exempt deemed
re-acquisition of the underlying securities.

Because the SDR would be a long derivative security in the hands of the insider as holder, this expiration would be exempt
from short-swing profit recovery pursuant to Rule 16b&hyph;6(d). Although proposed Rule 16a&hyph;4(e), discussed
above in the text accompanying note 78, would exempt the expiration from reporting as well, in the context of an equity
swap such an expiration should be reported because it is an integral component of the overall transaction.

Rule 16b&hyph;6(b) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;6(b)] would exempt the first two components of the exercise of the SAR because
the deemed sale would have taken place at the time the SAR was sold by the insider; however, the deemed acquisition that
occurs simultaneously would not be exempt.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the price decreases, so that the insider receives cash from the counterparty, the insider should report the expiration
of the SAR.
<FOOTCITE>109</FOOTCITE>
 The insider also should report on Form 4 the exercise of the SDR as the simultaneous exempt disposition of a put derivative
security as a result of its exercise, the exempt deemed disposition of the underlying securities as a result of the
exercise, and the non-exempt deemed acquisition of the underlying securities.

With respect to the insider as the writer, rather than the buyer, of the SAR, Rule 16b&hyph;6(d) provides that upon
any cancellation or expiration within six months of writing the option, profit recovery shall not exceed the premium

The current rules limit the exemption for the disposition of securities pursuant to a qualified domestic relations

of a put equivalent position and deemed sale of the underlying stock. Subsequent expiration of the unexercised option
arguably could constitute a purchase of the underlying security, matchable with the over-allotment option grant
or other sales by the insider within a six-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing that over-allotment options facilitate public offerings and do not lend themselves to the speculative
abuse Section 16 was designed to prevent, the staff issued interpretive relief to prevent this unintended result.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
117
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposal would codify this relief by explicitly excluding over-allotment options from the derivative security
definition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
118
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Of course, a sale of securities to an underwriter upon exercise of the over-allotment option would remain a sale for
Section 16 purposes. Comment is solicited on whether additional conditions should be placed on the exclusion, such
as requiring that the option comply with all applicable regulations and policies of the National Association of Securities
Dealers.

V. Request for Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any interested person wishing to submit written comments on the proposed revisions to the Commission's Section 16
rules and forms, and compliance disclosure requirements, as well as on other matters that might have an impact on the
proposals contained herein, is requested to do so. In addition, the Commission requests comment on whether any further
changes to the Section 16 rules, particularly Rule 16b&hyph;3, are necessary or appropriate at this time. Comment
is requested specifically from persons subject to Section 16; issuers whose officers, directors and ten percent
shareholders are subject to Section 16; and persons using the information afforded by the Section 16(a) reports.
The Commission also requests comment on whether the proposed rules, if adopted, would have an adverse impact on competition
or would impose a burden on competition that is neither necessary nor appropriate in furthering the purposes of the
Exchange Act. Comments responsive to this inquiry will be considered by the Commission in complying with its responsibilities
under Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act.

VI. Transition to New Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the proposed rule revisions are adopted, provisions for a transition from the current rules will be necessary,
particularly with respect to proposed Rule 16b&hyph;3. Although the discussion below represents the Commission's
current intent regarding transition to the proposed revised rules, this schedule is subject to modification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission intends to make the proposed rule amendments, other than those to Rule 16b&hyph;3, effective with
respect to reports that are, or would have been, due on or after the 45th day following the date of adoption (the ``Effective
Date''), with earlier compliance permitted. Of course, to the extent that proposed rules codify interpretive positions,
those positions continue to be valid before the Effective Date. Trusts currently subject to Section 16 that would
be relieved of Section 16 obligations under the proposed rules would not be subject to any post-termination reporting
obligations or required to file a final Form 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In extending the phase-in period for current Rule 16b&hyph;3, the Commission stated that this period would continue
until September 1, 1994, or such earlier date as set in further rulemaking under Section 16. Given the timing of these
rule proposals, the Commission is extending the phase-in date until September 1, 1995 or such different date as set
in further rulemaking.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
120
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Current and former Rule 16b&hyph;3 would remain available until September 1, 1995,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
121
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 unless a different date is set by the Commission in the adopting release. Comment is solicited on how long a transition
period issuers and insiders would need, assuming adoption of the proposals. Of course, issuers continue to be permitted
to convert their plans to current Rule 16b&hyph;3 at any time, provided that all plans of the issuer are converted.
After the phase-in date, issuers and insiders will no longer be able to rely on the former employee benefit plan exemptions,
but instead will need to comply with current Rule 16b&hyph;3 (modified to the extent the Commission adopts these rule
proposals).

Because proposed Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(8), which would exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' the
right or obligation to surrender a security or to have a security withheld in satisfaction of an exercise price or tax
withholding obligation, is inextricably linked to the proposed amendment of Rule 16b&hyph;3(e), the Commission
proposes to link the availability of proposed Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(8) to conversion of the plan to proposed Rule 16b&hyph;3.

VII. Cost-Benefit Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters are requested to provide their views and data to assist the Commission in evaluating the costs and benefits
associated with the proposed amendments. It is expected that the amendments would decrease significantly the compliance
burden imposed on persons subject to Section 16 and attendant costs without undercutting the statutory objectives
of disclosing information concerning insider trading and discouraging speculative short-term insider trading.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed simplification of the treatment of employee benefit plan transactions would constitute the most important
reduction in compliance burden. The proposed rules also would reduce compliance costs by: permitting joint and group
reporting where more than one person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities; providing that Section
16 applies to a trust only if the trust beneficially owns more than ten percent of a class of registered equity securities;
and limiting officers' and directors' post-termination reporting obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the proposed rules would expand the exemption for stock splits and stock dividends to include stock
dividends in which securities of a different issuer are distributed, and would provide a general exemption from reporting
and short-swing profit recovery for the disposition of securities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.

VIII. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 concerning the proposed
amendments. The analysis notes that the proposed amendments are intended to simplify the Section 16 regulatory scheme,
particularly with respect to employee benefit plans, and codify several staff interpretive positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed more fully in the analysis, most of the reporting persons the proposed amendments would affect are small
entities, as defined by the Commission's rules. The proposed amendments would decrease the reporting and compliance
requirements imposed upon corporate insiders subject to Section 16. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis discusses several possible alternatives to the proposed amendments including, among others, establishing
different compliance or reporting requirements for small entities or exempting them from all or part of the proposed
requirements. As discussed more fully in the analysis, implementation of any of these alternatives either would
be duplicative of the proposed amendments or inconsistent with the Exchange Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are encouraged on any aspect of the analysis. A copy of the analysis may be obtained by contacting Elizabeth
Murphy, Office of Disclosure Policy, Division of Corporation Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.
