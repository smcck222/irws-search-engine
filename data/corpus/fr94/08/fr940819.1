<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its Planning and Performing Site Development Work regulation.
This proposal is consistent with Section 716 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 which amended Section
535 of the Housing Act of 1949 to allow the Secretary to accept subdivisions that have been approved by local, county
or State agencies. FmHA will no longer review or approve subdivisions, but will review individual sites for the program.
This action is consistent with similar actions being proposed or enacted by HUD and VA. A good site approval authority
will allow FmHA to bring into the program many low cost homes in subdivisions that have already been developed. Many
of these were not previously reached because the seller would not, or could not afford to furnish FmHA all the required
data for a total subdivision approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assure that lower income people, particularly minorities and single women head-of-households, are afforded
quality sites, subdivisions must meet the community standards and the sites must meet FmHA's site underwriting criteria.
Environmental reviews will be required on a site by site basis and cumulative effects will be addressed when indicated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture is committed to carrying out its statutory and regulatory mandates in a manner that
best serves the public interest. Therefore, where legal discretion permits, the Department actively seeks to promulgate
regulations that promote economic growth, create jobs, are minimally burdensome and are easy for the public to understand,
use or comply with. In short, the Department is committed to issuing regulations that maximize the net benefits to
society and minimize costs imposed by those regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has developed and reviewed this regulatory proposal in accordance with these principles. Nonetheless,
the Department believes that public input from all interested persons can be invaluable to ensuring that the final
regulatory product is minimally burdensome and maximally efficient. Therefore, the Department specifically seeks
comments and suggestions from the public regarding any less burdensome or more efficient alternative that would
accomplish the purposes described in the proposal. Comments suggesting less burdensome or more efficient alternatives
should be addressed to the agency as provided in this proposal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FmHA stands alone as the only Federal Agency that requires approval of a complete subdivision prior to insuring or
guaranteeing a loan for a home within the subdivision. Developers, builders, realtors and applicants for the programs
have frequently complained that there is too much ``red tape'' before an eligible applicant can receive an FmHA loan
within a well developed subdivision. Most counties and communities now have adequate subdivision reviews, and FmHA's
subdivision approval is not needed to assure quality sites but is duplication of efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action permits the better use of existing developments and decreases the environmental impact because not as
many new developments will be needed to meet the demand for lots that will meet the Agency's requirements. It fits into
existing growth patterns and places more authority with the local people. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FmHA is committed to quality sites for its programs and therefore, proposes close scrutiny of the site. The new site
criteria incorporates many of the prior subdivision requirements and makes them part of the site underwriting criteria.
This action provides for better sites, without requiring the cumbersome subdivision review and approval process.
It also provides the loan applicant with assurance of a quality water supply and property served by publicly owned
and maintained roads. The proposal provides for an orderly request for review and systematic process of reviewing
the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed regulation omits the detailed internal agency administrative instruction used by the field offices
to administer the program. In the past, FmHA program regulations and FmHA Instructions have been identical. The Agency
has adopted a policy of publishing regulations which set forth anything which confers a benefit or imposes an obligation
on the public or which is necessary for the public to understand their responsibilities. The Agency does not intend
to publish a regulation that omits or evades issues which are subject to public comment or would be of interest to the
public. Any substantive changes in the regulation will continue to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each FmHA field office has a copy of the FmHA Instruction and a copy is available upon request to FmHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conforming changes will be made in other FmHA regulations at the final rule stage.

 Planning is an evaluation of specific development for specific land uses. Planning must take into consideration
topography, soils, climate, adjacent land use, environmental impacts, energy efficiency, local economy, aesthetic
and cultural values, public and private services, housing and social conditions and a degree of flexibility to accommodate
changing demands. Although all planning and performing development work is the responsibility of the applicant
or developer, close coordination must occur with local planning officials and with the respective Agency office
to minimize the chances of spending money on development that does not meet the Agency's requirements. All development
will be arranged and completed according to applicable local, State or Federal regulations including applicable
health and safety standards, environmental concerns and requirements of this subpart. When a public authority requires
inspections prior to final acceptance, written assurance by the responsible public authority, of compliance to
local, city, county, State or other public codes, regulations and ordinances is required prior to final acceptance
by the Agency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An applicant or developer for a Multiple Family Housing project or a Single Family Housing site which requires
technical services under &sect;1924.13(a) of subpart A of this part, must contract for the technical services of
an architect, engineer, land surveyor, landscape architect, or site planner, as appropriate, to provide complete
planning, drawings, and specifications. Such services may be provided by the applicant's or developer's ``in house''
staff subject to Agency concurrence. Technical services must be performed by professionals who are qualified and
authorized to provide such services in the State in which the project would be developed. All technical services must
be provided in accordance with the requirements of professional registration or licensing boards. For payments
for technical services, follow &sect;1924.102(c) of this subpart. At completion of all construction or completion
of a phase or phases of the total project, the person(s) providing technical services under this section must notify
the Agency office in writing that all work has been completed in substantial conformance with the approved plans and
specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Site development design requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Exhibit B of this subpart will be used as a guide by applicants or developers in preparing proposals and supporting
documents for Single Family Housing loans, in addition to specific requirements made in this subpart.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Environmental review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An individual Single Family Housing loan is normally considered a Categorical Exclusion under the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA). However, Form FmHA 1940&hyph;22, ``Environmental Checklist for Categorical Exclusions,''
must be completed by the Agency to determine that the specific action complies not only with NEPA, but also with other
applicable environmental laws, executive orders, and regulations. To complete the form, the preparer will use reliable
environmental information. Sources of such information include, but are not limited to, the State's Natural Resource
Management Guide and the appraisal. If the completed Form FmHA 1940&hyph;22 indicates a potential impact to one or
more environmental resources, the action is subject to disqualification as Categorical Exclusion and a Class I assessment
must be completed in accordance with &sect;1940.317(g) of subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter. If it is obvious at
the outset that the action will be disqualified as a Categorical Exclusion, the preparer should forego completion
of Form FmHA 1940&hyph;22 and proceed directly to the Class I assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If it appears that an action will be subject to disqualification as a Categorical Exclusion due to indications
of cumulative impacts, a Class I or Class II assessment will be completed, as appropriate, in accordance with subpart
G of Part 1940 of this chapter. A cumulative impact is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental
impact of the proposed action, when added to other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless
of what Agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions.

Multiple family housing projects shall be located in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (r) of &sect;1944.215
of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter. Locating sites in less than desirable locations of the community or in close
proximity to undesirable influences such as railroad tracks, cemeteries; adjacent to or behind commercial sites;
bordering structures which are not decent, safe, or sanitary or a positive conducive influence on the proposed site;
bordering sites which have potential environmental concerns such as processing plants, etc., is not acceptable.
Screening such sites does not make them acceptable. Sites which are not an integral part of a residential community
and do not have a reasonable access, either by location or terrain, to essential community facilities such as water,
sewerage, schools, shopping, employment opportunities, medical facilities, etc., are equally not acceptable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals processed under this paragraph shall be served by centrally owned and operated water and wastewater disposal
systems unless this is determined to be economically or environmentally unfeasible. All central systems, whether
they are public, community or private, shall meet the design requirements of the State Department of Health or other
comparable reviewing and regulatory authority(ies). The regulatory authority(ies) will verify in writing that
the water and wastewater systems are in compliance with the current provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act and the
Clean Water Act, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Sites which are not presently served by a central system, but are scheduled for tie-in to the central system within
2 years should have all lines installed during the initial construction. Such developments must have an approved
interim water supply or wastewater disposal system installed capable of satisfactory service until the scheduled
tie-in occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In addition to written assurance of compliance with State and local requirements, there must be assurance of
continuous service at reasonable rates for central water and wastewater disposal systems. Public ownership is preferred
whenever possible. In cases where interim facilities are installed pending extension or construction of permanent
public services, the developer must assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the interim facility
or establish an entity for its operation and maintenance which is acceptable to the local governing body. If a system
is not or will not be publicly owned and operated, it must comply with one of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Be an organization that meets the ownership and operating requirements for a water or wastewater disposal system
that the Agency could finance under subpart A of part 1942 of this chapter or be dedicated to and accepted by such an organization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Be an organization or individual that meets other acceptable methods of ownership and operation as outlined in
HUD Handbook 4075.12, ``Ownership and Organization of Central Water and Sewerage Systems.'' The Agency should be
assured that the organization has the right, in its sole discretion, to enforce the obligation of the operator of the
water and/or sewerage systems to provide satisfactory continuous service at reasonable rates. The advice and assistance
of the Regional Attorney should be obtained in preparing any necessary agreement with the organization or individual
supplying water and/or sewerage systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Be adequately controlled as to rates and services by a public body (unit of Government or public services commission).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) When central systems are not available, the Agency will thoroughly evaluate the proposed individual systems
for economic feasibility and potential impact on the environment. Information and guidance for evaluation and design
of individual water and wastewater systems is contained in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publications
``Manual of Individual Water Supply Systems'' and ``Design Manual, Onsite Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems'',
respectively. Developments of more than 25 dwelling units with individual systems must have the National Office
concurrence. A request for concurrence must contain written recommendations and the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Information prepared by the local, county or State regulatory authority having jurisdiction indicating whether
individual systems are feasible on the proposed sites. Supporting factual data should include evidence that clearly
shows that individual systems will perform satisfactorily for a reasonable period of time with reasonable maintenance
cost. Reasonable time and reasonable cost can be equated with the cost and expected life of a central system if one were
available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Soil and geologic conditions must be suitable for the type of construction proposed. In questionable or unsurveyed
areas, the applicant or developer will provide an engineering report with supporting data sufficient to identify
all pertinent subsurface conditions which could adversely affect the structure and show proposed solutions. Grading
will promote drainage of surface water away from buildings and foundations, minimize earth settlement and erosion,
and assure that drainage from adjacent properties onto the development or from the development to adjacent properties
does not create a health hazard or other undesirable conditions. Grading and drainage will comply with Exhibit B,
paragraphs III and IV, of this subpart.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Development requiring extensive earthwork, cuts and fills of 4 feet or more shall be designed by a duly licensed or
registered engineer. Where topography requires fills or extensive earthwork that must support structures and building
foundations, these must be controlled fills designed, supervised and tested by a qualified soils engineer.

Slope protection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All slopes must be protected from erosion by planting or other means. Slopes may require temporary cover if exposed
for long periods during construction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Storm water systems. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The design of storm water systems must consider convenience and property protection both at the individual site level
and the drainage basin level. Storm water systems should be compatible with the natural features of the site. In areas
with inadequate natural and/or man-made drainage systems, permanent and/or temporary storm water storage shall
be an integral part of the overall development plan. Design of these facilities shall consider safety, appearance
and economical maintenance operations.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its regulations that are utilized by the Rural Development
Administration (RDA) in administering Community Facility Loans and Grants. This action is necessary to implement
a provision of the Rural Electrification Administration Loan Restructuring Act of 1993, (REA Act) and change the
security requirements for solid waste disposal loans. The REA Act prohibits that a condition for assistance under
any RDA program be a requirement that the recipient of such assistance accept or receive electric service from any
particular utility, supplier, or cooperative. Also, a change is proposed in the security requirements for loans
secured primarily by revenue and the funds used to construct or improve solid waste facilities in rural communities.
The intended effect of changing the security requirements for solid waste facilities is to provide better service
to communities seeking to resolve solid waste disposal problems on a regional level.

in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507). This proposed rule does not revise or impose any new
information collection requirement from those approved by OMB.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A change is proposed in the security requirements for loans made for construction or improvements to solid waste facilities.
The requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency Subtitle D regulations have increased the capital needs
of rural communities for disposal of solid waste. The current security requirements for loans on solid waste facilities
are too stringent, and this proposed action will add flexibility that is needed to improve the program. Currently,
additional security is required when revenue is the primary security for loans involving solid waste facilities.
The proposed change will remove the requirement for additional security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed action also incorporates into RDA loan and grant regulations the provision contained in the REA Act
of 1993 which prohibits a recipient of the programs from imposing certain conditions on the users of the service provided.
For example, a utility, supplier, or cooperative that provides electric service cannot obtain RDA financing for
a water system and require that the water customers connect to their electric system as a condition for receiving water.
The REA Act requires that appropriate measures and sanctions be implemented against any person violating or attempting
to violate this prohibition.

Prohibition on electric service.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Recipients of assistance processed in accordance with this subpart cannot require the users of the services provided
to accept or receive electric service from any particular utility, supplier, or cooperative. If the recipient of
assistance is a utility, supplier, or cooperative that provides electric service, the recipient must agree that
users of the facility financed will not be required to accept or receive electric service. All recipients that also
provide electric service must include the following in its rules and regulations: ``No existing or future user of
the facility financed by the Rural Development Administration has been or will be required to receive electric service
as a condition to utilize the services provided by the facility.'' A violation of this prohibition will result in the
acceleration of all loans received under this subpart and debarment from receiving future Federal financial assistance.
Compliance with this paragraph will be monitored through routine servicing procedures.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is announcing a revised date for the Technology Demonstration described in its proposed rule (59 FR
37360, July 21, 1994). The Department is also extending the deadline for submission of comments on the proposed rule
to Friday, September 30, 1994, to allow commenters additional time to incorporate into their comments any views they
have developed as a result of the Technology Demonstration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Department is announcing the availability of an electronic conference as another tool for interested
persons to exchange information and ideas on the computer loan origination (CLO) aspects of the proposed rule. The
electronic conference will be for discussion only; comments must still be in writing and submitted as described above
under the heading 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
addresses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in order to be considered by the Department during the development of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This on-line conference will run 24 hours per day from August 19, 1994, to September 30, 1994, and will provide industry
and individual users who access the conference an opportunity to discuss and debate with one another the CLO aspects
of the proposed rule through a computer network. The conference is called CLOnet and can be accessed by calling Metasystems
Design Group, Inc. (MDG), in Arlington, Virginia, telephone (703) 243&hyph;6622. There is a monthly charge of $20,
after which connect time is unlimited and free (other than long-distance charges). A personal computer (PC), modem,
and communications software are required to access the conference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is using this opportunity as a trial for supplementing its existing FHAnet with the subject-specific
CLOnet. Both conferences can provide an excellent interactive method for the public to ``meet'' on and discuss relevant
matters. Because the purpose of the current CLOnet is to provide an electronic medium for discussion of the effect
of the proposed rule on CLOs and consumers, any HUD employee who chooses to participate in the discussion may do so only
in his or her individual capacity and not in any official capacity as a representative of the Department.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposed on June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28594) to revise its Safety
and Health Regulations for Longshoring and, to a far lesser extent, to amend its Safety and Health Regulations for
Marine Terminals. The proposed rule covers cargo handling and related activities conducted aboard vessels and at
Marine Terminals. The proposed amendments to the Marine Terminals standard are intended primarily to provide regulatory
consistency with the proposed Longshoring ship-board rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The June 2, 1994 notice and subsequent correction notice on June 13, 1994 (59 FR 30389) announced the cities and dates
for three informal rulemaking hearings that will be held on all issues raised by the proposal. The dates of these hearings
have been changed. This notice sets the new dates and specific locations of the informal public hearings to be held
as part of the rulemaking process. In addition, it extends the original date for the submission of Notices of Intention
to Appear by three weeks and reduces the time frame for the submission of documentary evidence and the text of lengthy
testimony from 21 days to 14 days prior to the date of the hearing where the evidence will be presented.

Conduct and Nature of Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The hearing will commence at 9:30 a.m. on the first day. At that time, any procedural matters relating to the proceeding
will be resolved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of an informal rulemaking hearing is established in the legislative history of section 6 of the OSH Act and
is reflected by OSHA's rules of procedure for hearings (29 CFR 1911.15(a)). Although the presiding officer is an Administrative
Law Judge and questioning by interested persons is allowed on crucial issues, the proceeding is informal and legislative
in type. The Agency's intent is to provide interested persons with an opportunity to make effective oral presentations
which can proceed expeditiously in the absence of procedural restraints which might impede or protract the rulemaking
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, since the hearing is primarily for information gathering and clarification, it is an informal administrative
proceeding rather than an adjudicative one. The technical rules of evidence, for example, do not apply. The regulations
that govern hearings, and the pre-hearing guidelines which the ALJ will issue for this hearing, will ensure fairness
and due process and also facilitate the development of a clear, accurate and complete record. Those rules and guidelines
will be interpreted in a manner that furthers that development. Thus, questions of relevance, procedure and participation
generally will be decided so as to favor development of the record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing will be conducted in accordance with 29 CFR part 1911. It should be noted that &sect;1911.4 allows the Assistant
Secretary, upon reasonable notice, to issue alternative procedures to expedite proceedings or for other good cause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing will be presided over by an Administrative Law Judge who makes no decision or recommendation on the merits
of OSHA's proposal. The responsibility of the Administrative Law Judge is to ensure that the hearing proceeds at a
reasonable pace and in an orderly manner. The Administrative Law Judge, therefore, will have all the powers necessary
and appropriate to conduct a full and fair informal hearing as provided in 29 CFR part 1911, including the powers:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. To regulate the course of the proceedings;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. To dispose of procedural requests, objections and comparable matters;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. To confine the presentations to the matters pertinent to the issues raised;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. To regulate the conduct of those present at the hearing by appropriate means;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. In the Judge's discretion, to question and permit the questioning of any witnesses and to limit the time for questioning;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. In the Judge's discretion, to keep the record open for a reasonable, stated time (known as the post-hearing comment
period) to receive written information and additional data, views and arguments from any person who has participated
in the oral proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA recognizes that there may be interested persons or organizations who, through their knowledge of the subject
matter or their experience in the field, would wish to endorse or support the whole proposal or certain provisions
of the proposal. OSHA welcomes such supportive comments, including any pertinent data and cost information which
may be available, in order that the record of this rulemaking will present a balanced picture of public response on
the issues involved.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is proposing to adopt permanent special local regulations for the annual Festival on the Fourth. This
event is held each year on July 4 on the Ashley River, at Charleston, South Carolina. In the past, the Coast Guard established
temporary special local regulations each year to protect the safety of life on the navigable waters during the effective
times. However, because the event recurs annually, the Coast Guard is proposing a permanent description of the event
and establishment of permanent regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to better serve the boating public
by creating a permanent reference.

Discussion of Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Charleston Water Festival, Inc., sponsors the Festival on the Fourth celebration. Approximately, two towboats,
one pick-up boat, forty waterskiers, and five jet skiers conduct various exhibitions during the Festival on the Fourth
event, including ski jumping, kite skiing and jet ski maneuvering. The event also closes with a fireworks display
on that portion of the Ashley River in Charleston, South Carolina, between Brittle Bank Park and the main river channel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The event's exhibitions, coupled with the fireworks display, create an extra hazard in the navigable waters and require
these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. The regulated area encompasses less than one nautical mile on the Ashley River
from Brittle Bank Park to the main river channel in Charleston, South Carolina, entry into which is prohibited for
eleven and a half hours on the day of the event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the impact of this proposal is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, it will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Texas for the purpose
of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program.
The SIP revision was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in the Clean Air Act (CAA), to ensure
that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with
the CAA. In the Final Rules Section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule,
no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final
rule will be withdrawn, and all public comments received during the 30-day comment period set forth below will be addressed
in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should
do so at this time.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 8, 1994 (59 FR 5868), the EPA proposed standards (the proposal or proposed standards) to limit emissions
of hazardous air pollutants (HAP's) from existing and new bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations
under section 112 of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (Act). The public comment period on the proposed rule ended
April 11, 1994. This action announces the availability of supplemental information and the reopening of the comment
period for comment on only the supplemental information. This supplemental information was provided during the
comment period on the proposal and pertains to the level of control and test procedures for tank truck leakage. The
EPA plans to consider comments received on this action, along with the comments received on the proposal, and take
final action on the rule on November 23, 1994 as required under consent decree. Due to this short schedule, only a 30-day
comment period is being provided and no public hearing will be held.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 8, 1994 (59 FR 5868), the EPA proposed standards to limit emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP's)
from existing and new bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations under section 112 of the Act. Two comment
letters presented information on California standards for tank truck leaks at existing facilities that are more
stringent than those standards proposed by the EPA. The EPA proposed that tank trucks and railcars annually pass a
pressure and vacuum test before loading gasoline at existing and new major source facilities. The California standards
have a more stringent requirement for the annual test, an additional annual test for internal vapor valves, and a year-round
leak rate requirement and test procedures. Additionally, the EPA proposed for new facilities the use of a loading
rack vacuum assist system, in addition to the proposed annual pressure and vacuum test, to further control leakage
from tank trucks and railcars. The EPA did not analyze nor fully discuss these California standards during development
of the proposal or at proposal. The purpose of this notice is to announce and discuss the consideration of these additional
standards. Below is a discussion of the California standard for tank truck leakage and the EPA's consideration of
that information. As noted in the

ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of today's notice, the docket (Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;38) contains the California test procedures and
methods discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The California Air Resources Board (ARB) and the California air pollution control districts have been implementing
tank truck leakage standards since the late 1970's. Currently all tank trucks transporting gasoline in California,
including tank trucks from neighboring States that operate in California, must meet the California standards. In
summary they include three major standards, an annual certification and a year-round standard for the tank and its
vapor piping and hoses and a year-round pressure standard for the tank truck's internal vapor valve. The annual certification
standards include initially pressurizing and later evacuating the tank and associated vapor piping and hoses, to
18 inches of water and to 6 inches of water, respectively. In 5 minutes the allowable pressure change can be no more than
the values shown in Table 1. The EPA's Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) document and New Source Performance Standards
(NSPS) (40 CFR part 60, subpart XX) contain annual pressure and vacuum test levels of initial pressures and test duration
which are the same as California's. However, a less stringent pressure change of 3 inches of water column is allowed
for all tank trucks under the NSPS, CTG, and proposal.

Table 1 presents a year-round allowable pressure change standard that is 1.5 inches of water column higher than annual
certification allowable pressure change. This year-round standard is periodically demonstrated by a combustible
gas detector method or the annual certification test procedure (using the allowable year-round pressure change
value) by owners and operators and used by the California ARB and districts for audits and compliance, respectively.
Combustible gas detectors are easy to use and transport and can be used in the field while trucks are loading gasoline.
The annual certification pressure/vacuum test procedure requires the tank to be taken out of gasoline service and
requires more test equipment than the combustible gas detector method. Therefore, the combustible gas detector
method provides an easy-to-use field compliance procedure. Tank trucks with a leak found above 100 percent of the
lower explosive limit (LEL) on a combustible gas detector are required to be taken out of service until they pass the
allowable year-round pressure change using the annual certification test method. If the truck fails both tests,
the truck owner is fined and the tank is not allowed to return to service until it meets the annual certification standard.
Those tanks found to have leaks above 100 percent of the LEL and found to meet the year-round allowable pressure change
with the annual certification test procedure are not penalized if maintenance is not performed before the pressure
test. A similar combustible gas detector procedure was presented in the EPA's CTG, but is not contained in the NSPS
or this proposed NESHAP. However, some other States and oil companies are using this detector procedure as a compliance
method, in addition to the annual pressure and vacuum tests. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)
developed a field pressure test procedure that measures the pressure change without taking the tank out of service.
Nitrogen gas is used to pressurize the tank's vapor head space. This field pressure test method was determined by the
California ARB in 1986 to be equivalent to the combustible gas detector method. Since 1986, the BAAQMD has implemented
a comprehensive outreach program with the field pressure test. Operators are instructed in the field test procedure,
and participate in an ongoing inspection and maintenance program. Participation is voluntary, and the incentive
is to reduce the penalties for violations by having documentation showing a history of regular tests and maintenance
on the tank truck. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third California standard for tank trucks is the annually tested certification pressure test on the tank truck's
internal vapor valve. This valve provides a seal between the truck's tank and its vapor piping and connected hose.
For this test, the tank and associated vapor piping and hose are pressurized to 18 inches of water column, and the valve
is then closed. Then, while leaving the tank under pressure, the pressure in the tank truck's vapor collection piping
and vapor hose is released to atmospheric pressure and then capped. After 5 minutes, a pressure increase of no more
than 5 inches of water column is allowed to occur downstream of the valve in the tank truck's vapor piping and hose. Any
pressure increase indicates that the valve is leaking. This leakage would eventually be released to the atmosphere
when the vapor hose and piping are not connected to a vapor collection system. This standard for internal vapor valves
is not contained in the CTG, the NSPS, or the proposed standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California ARB is currently revising its tank truck standards to change the level of the annual test and is updating
its test procedures and methods. The BAAQMD tested 200 tank trucks and found that 86 percent of the trucks could pass
a 0.25-inch standard and 91 percent could pass a 0.5-inch standard. The California ARB proposed that the allowable
annual certification's allowable pressure change be reduced by 50 percent (1-inch drop is proposed to be reduced
to a 0.5-inch, etc.). Besides general updating and clarifications of the test procedures and methods, the California
ARB is adding the field pressure test used by BAAQMD in the ARB certification procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under section 112 of the Act, the minimum baseline (floor) at which standards may be set, for existing sources, is the
``average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources''(section 112(d)(3)
of the Act). The existing California standards are used statewide and on tank trucks from surrounding areas. California
is estimated to account for nearly 12 percent of the national gasoline consumption. Since trucks in California and
surrounding areas transport about 12 percent of the national gasoline, it is logical to assume that this represents
about 12 percent of the affected gasoline tank truck population. The EPA looks at emission limitations achieved by
each of the best performing 12 percent of existing sources, and average those limitations (59 FR 29196). ``Average''
is interpreted to mean a measure of central tendency such as the arithmetic mean or median. In the case of the California
standards, nearly or about 12 percent of tank trucks at least meet or exceed the California standards, therefore these
standards are at least the arithmetic average, and certainly the 94 percentile or median. Additionally, the existing
California standards achieve the lowest emission limitation (in this case by achieving the lowest leakage rates)
and are the best performing of existing sources. Thus, the EPA now considers the existing California standards as
the existing source floor since they represent the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12
percent of the existing sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA proposal contains a requirement to operate a vacuum assist system at new source facilities. The agency proposed
this requirement for new sources based on the system providing ``emission control that is achieved in practice by
the best controlled similar source'' (section 112(d)(3) of the Act). Many commenters questioned the amount of emission
control that would be achieved by the vacuum assist system. In the EPA's consideration of the vacuum assist system
as the floor for new sources, the EPA will also consider the existing California standards discussed earlier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through consideration of comments received on today's notice along with those on the proposed rule, the EPA will determine
the control levels to be applied to tank truck leakage. Today's opening of the comment period is only for taking comment
on the supplemental material contained in this notice on tank truck vapor leakage controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the EPA is requesting comments and data on the consideration of the existing California standards
as the floor level of control for new and existing facilities as required under section 112 of the Act. The EPA is also
requesting comment on whether the level of control for tank trucks at new and existing facilities should be based on
the existing or the proposed California standards. Comments are also requested on the use and accuracy of the test
procedures and methods referred to earlier and provided in the docket, including both the existing and updated or
revised procedures and methods.

(A) receives Federal funds under any of the following grant programs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Section 329 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 254b (relating to grants for migrant health centers);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Section 340A of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 256a (relating to grants for health services for residents of public housing);
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) meets the following requirements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) has implemented appropriate policies and procedures to reduce the risk of malpractice and the risk of lawsuits
arising out of any health or health-related functions performed by the entity;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) has reviewed and verified the professional credentials, references, claims history, fitness, progressional
review organization findings, and license status of its physicians and other licensed or certified health care practitioners,
and, where necessary, has obtained the permission from these individuals to gain access to this information;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) has no history of claims having been filed against the United States as a result of the application of section 224
to the entity of its officers, employees, of contractors as provided for under this section, or, is such a history exists,
has fully cooperated with the Attorney General in defending against any such claims and either has taken, or will take,
any necessary corrective steps to assure against such claims in the future; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) has fully cooperated with the Attorney General in providing information relating to an estimate described under
section 224(k) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;6.5 provides that an entity will be deemed to be an entity described in section 224(g) as of the effective
date of the notice which it receives from the Department of Health and Human Services that it has been deemed to be an
entity as described for purposes of the Act. Each notice shall be effective only as to acts and omissions occurring
on and after the date specified in the notice and prior to January 1, 1996, the statutory sunset date for this program.
(Proposed &sect;6.6(a).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, grantees contract with other entities (as opposed to individual contractors_see section III below)
for the provision of health services. The typical situation is a subgrant or contract for the provision of the full
range of health services. For example, the legislative history of Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 describes the case of a grantee
in the Los Angeles area which itself has no clinical staff, but which contracts with three primary care clinics for
the actual delivery of services. If one (or more) of these clinics provides the full range of services mandated under
section 330 to its own medically undeserved population, in accordance with other applicable requirements under
section 330, it would be eligible for a determination by the Secretary that it too is a covered entity. (H.R. Rep. No.
102&hyph;823, Part 2, p. 7, 102d Cong. 2d Sess., Sept. 14, 1992.) Proposed &sect;6.3(b) provides that the Secretary
will identify those contracting entities that will be subject to coverage under section 224(g) in notices issued
pursuant to &sect;6.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
III. Covered Individuals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In addition to the entity itself, section 224(g) provides that certain individuals may be covered under the FTCA.
Officers and employees are subject to coverage, as well as certain contractors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 102&hyph;501 provides that an individual may be considered to be a contractor of an entity described in
Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 only if_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) the individual normally performs on average at least 321/2 hours of service per week for the entity for the period
of the contract; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) in the case of an individual who normally performs on average less than 321/2 hours of services per week for the entity
for the period of the contract and is a licensed or certified provider of obstetrical services_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) the individual's medical malpractice liability insurance coverage does not extend to services performed by
the individual for the entity under the contract; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the Secretary finds that patients to whom the entity furnishes services will be deprived of obstetrical services
if such individual is not considered a contractor of the entity for purposes of paragraph (1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coverage of individuals, whether employees of contractors, does not extend to acts or omissions that are not related
to the grant supported activity. The covered entity itself (assuming it meets the statutory requirements for FTCA
coverage) will be covered for claims against it, even if an individual health care practitioner is not covered in a
particular case. Thus, for example, if a contractor works fewer than 321/2 hours and is not a provider of obstetrical
services, the contractor would not be covered for services related to the grant, but the grantee itself would be covered.

IV. Covered Acts and Omissions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Proposed &sect;6.6 provides elaboration on the scope of the statutory protection for covered entities and individuals.
Paragraph (a) states the relevant dates of coverage. Paragraph (b) repeats the provision of section 224(a) that limits
coverage to claims for damage for personal injury or death resulting from the performance of medical, surgical, dental,
or related functions. Paragraph (c) states that for covered individuals, only acts or omissions within the scope
of their employment (or contract for services, in the case of covered contractors) are covered. Thus, for example,
``moonlighting'' activities of a physician employed by a covered grantee would not be covered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) of proposed &sect;6.6 addresses the limitation that only acts or omissions related to the grant-supported
activity are covered. The Department is aware that there has been some confusion since the enactment of section 224(g)
about the types of activities that would be covered. In particular, there have been questions about the issue of when
coverage is available where individuals who are not registered patients of the grantee are treated. This paragraph
provides clear standards for answering these questions. Coverage will be available for the treatment of non-patients
of the covered entities only when the Secretary determines either that (1) the provision of the services to such individuals
benefits patients of the entity and general populations that could be served by the entity through community-wide
intervention efforts within the communities served by the entity, or (2) the provision of services to such individuals
facilitates the provision of services to patients of the entity, or (3) such services are otherwise required to be
provided to such individuals under an employment contract or similar arrangement between the entity and the covered
individual. Examples of situations within the scope of proposed &sect;6.6(d) are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A community health center deemed to be a covered entity establishes a school-based or school-linked health
program as part of its grant supported activity. Even though the students treated are not necessarily registered
patients of the center, the center and its health care practitioners will be covered for services provided, if the
Secretary makes the determination in subparagraph (1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A migrant health center requires its physicians to obtain staff privileges at a community hospital. As a condition
of obtaining such privileges, and thus being able to admit the center's patients to the hospital, the physicians must
agree to provide occasional coverage of the hospital's emergency room. The Secretary would be authorized to determine
that this coverage is necessary to facilitate the provision of services to the grantee's patients, and that it would
therefore be covered by subparagraph (2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A homeless health services grantee makes arrangements with local community providers for after-hours coverage
of its patients. The grantee's physicians are required by their employment contracts to provide periodic cross-coverage
for patients of these providers, in order to make this arrangement feasible. The Secretary may determine that the
arrangement is within the scope of subparagraph (3). Again, however, it should be understood that this would not extend
the scope of coverage under Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 to ``moonlighting'' activities by center health care practitioners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule is not intended to constitute, and does not constitute, a comprehensive notice pertaining to any
provision of Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 except to the extent that procedures pertaining to implementation of Pub. L. 102&hyph;501
are described explicitly above. The applicability of Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 and 42 U.S.C. 233(a) to a particular claim
or case will depend upon the determination or certification (as appropriate) by the Attorney General that the individual
or entity is covered by Pub. L. 102&hyph;501 and was acting within the scope of employment, in accordance with normal
Department of Justice procedures. A determination or certification by the Attorney General is subject to judicial
review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires that all regulations reflect consideration of alternatives, of costs, benefits,
incentives, equity, and availability of information. Regulations which are ``significant'' because of cost, adverse
effects on the economy, inconsistency with other agency actions, effects on the budget, or novel legal or policy issues,
require special analysis. In addition, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires that we include an analysis
of all rules the significantly impact small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations provide information whereby health care entities or individual scan determine when,
and to what extent they are likely to be protected for medical malpractice under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).
Therefore, the Secretary certifies that the proposed regulations will not have a significant effect on a substantial
number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 122 of the ADAMHA Reorganization Act, Public Law 102&hyph;321, which was enacted on July 10, 1992, transferred
Public Health Service (PHS) Act section 511, National Alcohol Research Center, to Title IV, Part C, Subpart 14 of the
Act, and redesignated the section as PHS Act section 464J. Under PHS Act section 464J, the Secretary, acting through
the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), may designate National Alcohol Research Centers
for the purpose of interdisciplinary research relating to alcoholism and other biomedical, behavioral and social
issues related to alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and shall make annual grants to the Centers, including a grant to a
designated Center for research on the effects of alcohol on the elderly. The NIH proposes to amend the current regulations
governing these grants by revising the ``Table of Contents'' section, removing reserved sections 54a.508 and 54a.509,
and redesignating section 54a.510 as 54a.508, revising the authority citation and ``Applicability'' section to
show the changes necessitated by enactment of the ADAMHA Reorganization Act, providing additional definitions,
replacing the language in section 54a.504 with non-specific language which will eliminate the need to seek OMB regulatory
review for future changes in the grant application form, and revise section 54a.506(c) by removing the $1 million
limitation on grant awards to conform to Public Law 98&hyph;24 which eliminated the $1 million cap. Additionally,
NIH proposes to add a new section 54a.509 to the current regulations setting forth other HHS policies and regulations
that apply to grants awarded under subpart E. The purpose of this notice is to invite public comment on these proposed
changes. The following statements are provided for the information of the public.

Regulatory Impact Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this rule merely makes minor changes in grant application practices and conforms grant awards to the current
statute, it will have no consequential effects on the economy or small entities. Therefore the Secretary has determined
that this rule is not significant within the definition of Executive Order 12866, and the Secretary certifies that
this rule will not have a significant impact on a substential number of small entities.

This notice of proposed rulemaking would amend the regulations concerning the U.S. Repatriate Program. The proposed
rule would require agencies which provide assistance to groups of United States citizens who are returned from foreign
countries to the United States by the Department of State due to war, threat of war, civil disorder, or natural disaster
to request and obtain advance approval from the Administration for Children and Families to incur expenses for developing
and preparing to implement repatriation plans for groups of eligible persons. This action is necessary in order for
the Department to appropriately oversee the limited funding available for such activities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The U.S. Repatriate Program is authorized by Section 1113 of the Social Security Act and is responsive to Executive
Order 12656 regarding services provided to repatriated U.S. citizens. The program provides temporary assistance
to needy U.S. citizens and their dependents who are returned to the United States by the Department of State for reasons
of destitution, illness, war, threat of war, invasion, civil unrest, or natural disaster. Under current law and regulations,
assistance provided through the program to repatriates must be repaid to the United States Government unless the
Assistant Secretary for Children and Families specifically waives this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Group Repatriation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
When groups of U.S. citizens and their dependents must be evacuated from foreign countries and returned to the United
States due to war, threat of war, invasion, civil unrest, or natural disaster, States administer the necessary reception
and assistance. These repatriation events are generally referred to as Group Repatriations. In the event that the
President declares a national security emergency, Executive Order 12656, ``Assignment of Emergency Preparedness
Responsibilities,'' requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to coordinate such a repatriation. This
type of group repatriation is referred to as Emergency Repatriation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to E.O. 12656, the U.S. Repatriate Program has developed a National Emergency Repatriation Plan which
calls for States to develop their own Emergency Repatriation Plans. Under these plans, the States provide for the
logistical arrangements for receiving U.S. citizens repatriated as part of a declared national security emergency
and providing assistance for their travel to their final destinations and other necessities to ensure the immediate
welfare of the repatriates. These plans are activated upon the request of the Department if, and only if, the President
declares a national security emergency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the States' Emergency Repatriation Plans are suitable for use in the event that groups of American citizens
are evacuated due to war or threat of war, invasion or other civil violence, or natural disaster_but a national security
emergency is not declared under Executive Order 12656_the U.S. Repatriate Program recognizes that States could
use these plans as both Emergency Repatriation Plans and Group Repatriation Plans, and encourages them to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Administrative Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The statutory authority, as well as the current regulations, provide for States or other agencies providing repatriation
assistance to be reimbursed for their administrative expenses. Since group/emergency repatriations are a relatively
rare event, the Department wishes to ensure that the amount of administrative expenses incurred by States in planning
or preparing for receiving group repatriations is reasonable and appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To this end, we are proposing that if States wish to be reimbursed for their administrative expenses, they must seek
and receive prior approval from the Department before incurring expenses associated with developing group/emergency
repatriation plans. States must also receive prior approval to be reimbursed for the costs of preparing to implement
the plans, such as conducting training exercises or making physical preparations to a reception site, unless notified
by the Department that such preparations are necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to keep administrative requirements to a minimum, we are not proposing to mandate any particular format for
States to request approval. In submitting a written request for administrative expenses in advance of incurring
costs, a State may use any format the State desires. States should include an estimate of the expenses they will incur,
along with a description of the activities to be undertaken and a rationale for the expenditure.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Departmental review of the request will consist of (1) determining if the activities are, in fact, necessary, and
(2) evaluating whether the estimated cost is reasonable for the activities to be conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also proposing to make technical changes throughout 45 CFR part 212 to update references to the office's designation
and the agency official's title.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Public Law 96&hyph;354) requires the Federal Government to anticipate and reduce
the impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary impact of this rule is on State governments. Therefore, we certify that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it would simply require agencies to obtain advance
approval from the Administration for Children and Families before incurring administrative costs in developing
implementation plans for the repatriation of groups of eligible individuals. Thus, a regulatory flexibility analysis
is not required.

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities
and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department determined that this rule is consistent with these
priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including
not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome
while still achieving the regulatory objectives.

This proposed amendment would require States to submit information regarding their activities and estimated costs
for Departmental approval prior to the incurring of administrative expenses for planning and implementing group/emergency
repatriation procedures. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) has been requested.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA proposes to amend the railroad accident reporting rules in several ways. First, FRA would require railroads to
adopt internal control procedures to ensure accurate reporting of accidents, casualties, and highway-rail grade
crossing accidents. Second, FRA would allow railroads to submit and update accident, casualty, and highway-rail
accident reports through transfer of information on computer diskettes or magnetic tapes. Third, FRA would revise
the accident and injury reporting forms, including definitions. Fourth, FRA would revise injury and illness, as
well as derailment and collision, recordkeeping requirements. Finally, FRA would revise the method by which it will
determine and periodically adjust the accident reporting threshold.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Purpose and Structure of the Accident Reporting Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA's primary function is to promote safety within the railroad industry. To carry out its safety mission, FRA needs
information about the conditions of the nation's railroads to enforce safety regulations and to develop railroad
injury and accident prevention programs. The injury and accident reports submitted by the railroads form a principal
basis for FRA's railroad safety program. FRA uses injury and accident data for, among other things, establishing
its inspection strategy, determining comparative trends of railroad safety, and calculating the costs and benefits
of proposed safety rules. Because FRA uses the data in all aspects of its operations, it is important that the data it
receives be as accurate and consistent as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The railroad accident reporting regulations set forth in 49 CFR part 225 require railroads to submit monthly reports
to FRA summarizing collisions, derailments, and certain other accidents/incidents involving damages above a periodically
revised dollar threshold, as well as certain injuries to passengers, employees, and other persons on railroad property.
The regulations presently define an ``accident/incident'' in &sect;225.5(b) as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any impact between railroad on-track equipment and an automobile, bus, truck, motorcycle, bicycle, farm vehicle
or pedestrian at a rail-highway grade crossing; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any collision, derailment, fire, explosion, act of God, or other event involving operation of railroad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on-track equipment (standing or moving) that results in more than $6,300 in damages to railroad on-track equipment,
signals, track, track structures, and roadbed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any event arising from the operation of a railroad which results in: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Death of one or more persons; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Injury to one or more persons, other than railroad employees, that requires medical treatment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Injury to one or more employees that requires medical treatment or results in restriction of work or motion for
one or more days, one or more lost work days, transfer to another job, termination of employment, or loss of consciousness;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Occupational illness of a railroad employee as diagnosed by a physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 225.19 of the regulations presently divides railroad accidents/incidents into three categories: (1) highway-rail
grade crossing accidents/incidents; (2) rail equipment accidents/incidents; and (3) death, injury, or occupational
illness accidents/incidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Every railroad accident/incident meeting the stated criteria for each category must be reported to FRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49 CFR 225.11. Because the reporting requirements and the information needed regarding each category of accident/incident
are unique, a different reporting form is used for each category. If the circumstances of an accident/incident are
such that it falls within two or even all three categories, then a separate reporting form for each category must be
completed by the railroad. For example, if a highway-rail grade crossing accident involves damage to rail equipment
over the current reporting threshold of $6,300, then both a ``Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report''
(Form FRA F 6180.57) and a ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54) must be completed by the
reporting railroad. (In order to conform to the grade crossing signal system safety regulations in part 234, the term
``rail-highway'' will be changed to read ``highway-rail'' throughout part 225. This NPRM will hereinafter refer
to ``highway-rail'' grade crossings.) Further, if injuries are associated with the crossing accident, then the
monthly ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55a) must also be completed.

B. General Accounting Office Study on Accident Reporting to FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Increasingly concerned with railroad safety, Congress asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to determine whether
FRA's safety programs were adequate to protect railroad employees and the general public from injuries associated
with train accidents. GAO studied FRA's railroad injury and accident reporting data and issued a report (GAO/RCED&hyph;89&hyph;109)
that raised important questions about the quality of railroad compliance with FRA's accident reporting regulations.
GAO found that there was underreporting and inaccurate reporting of injury and accident data for 1987 by the railroads
it audited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GAO recommended that FRA (a) Require railroads to establish injury and accident reporting internal control procedures,
(b) include an analysis of railroads' internal control procedures for reporting in FRA's safety records inspections,
(c) provide inspectors with the authority to take enforcement actions against railroads with deficient internal
control procedures, (d) require railroads to update reports on workdays lost due to injuries, and (e) clarify FRA's
requirement for railroads to update accident reports when significant changes occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA's subsequent analysis of the findings from the 1989 GAO accident and injury reporting audit indicated that most
of the missing accident reports were ``fender benders'' and that the unreported injuries were minor. Nonetheless,
the accuracy of FRA's safety databases are of paramount importance, and FRA took several actions to improve railroads'
accident and injury reporting.

C. Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Accident Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 14, 1990, FRA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) soliciting comments and suggestions
from the public regarding methods of improving FRA's injury and accident reporting system and its governing regulations
(55 FR 9469). Interested parties were invited to participate in a public hearing held on May 17, 1990, and to file written
comments prior to May 25, 1990. The responses to that public notice provided additional information and identified
further issues and subissues related to the matters in the ANPRM. In order to further explore matters related to the
accident/incident reporting system, FRA held informal, open meetings on June 13, 1991, August 22, 1991, and August
18, 1992, in Washington, D.C., with members of the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Committee for Uniformity
in Reporting. At the request of rail labor representatives, FRA also held an informal, open meeting on October 21,
1991, in Washington, D.C., to discuss the same issues with representatives of various rail unions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

In addition to testimony from five organizations at the May 17, 1990 hearing, FRA received comments in response to
the ANPRM from over 15 parties including several railroads, railroad unions, railroad trade associations, as well
as two States. Discussions follow with respect to the primary issues addressed by the commenters.

A. Internal Control Procedures (Proposed &sect;225.33) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, GAO concluded that erroneous injury and accident reporting occurred primarily because the railroads
it studied lacked adequate internal procedures for properly classifying and reporting the events. GAO believed
that under a system of self-reporting such as the one FRA uses to obtain railroad safety data, internal control procedures
would be necessary to ensure that reliable and accurate data is obtained, maintained, and disclosed by the railroads.
GAO recommended that FRA mandate such internal control procedures, periodically review them, and then use its enforcement
authority to cite railroads for procedural deficiencies when inaccurate reporting is found and the cause can be attributed
to internal control weakness.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of the five railroads GAO visited, the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (``CNW'') was found to have
the most effective internal control procedures for updating injury and accident information prior to reporting
to FRA. CNW's procedures involved extensive communication between its safety office, which reports accident information
to FRA, and other departments within the railroad. CNW also centralized its reporting responsibilities and updated
injury and accident information before reporting to FRA. Specifically, (a) CNW's safety office and claim office
met once a month to compare lists of injuries; (b) CNW used a ``15-day'' report (this report accurately disclosed the
severity of each injury) to update the status of each injury before reporting it to FRA; (c) for train accidents, initial
field estimates of property damage were compared with repair shop estimates before submitting a report to FRA; and
(d) CNW required a final accident report to its safety office within 20 days following the accident to allow for further
updating of information on the accident/incident report and the identification of additional reportable events
prior to filing a report with FRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the ANPRM, comments were solicited as to whether FRA should require railroads to implement specific internal control
procedures to assure proper reporting or simply establish strict performance standards and hold railroads accountable
for accuracy of the submitted data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most commenters did not support mandated internal control procedures, primarily because each railroad is different
organizationally. Since internal control procedures would be adapted to the organizational structures of individual
railroads, most commenters felt it would be unreasonable to prescribe a rigid set of rules governing the audit function
for universal application. Instead, it was proposed that each railroad submit their own internal control procedures
to FRA for review and subsequent approval. FRA would then have the ability to audit the railroad based upon the railroad's
own operating plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One labor association suggested that internal control procedures that ensure accurate information should be mandated
by FRA. It was proposed that this could be accomplished by requiring the railroads to update all initial information
within a certain time period; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
after filing the initial monthly report, the railroad would be required to supplement any and all changes that existed
at the time of filing the initial report within a specified time frame. It was also recommended that railroads should
file an annual report that would supplement each monthly report and that the railroads' reporting information be
crosschecked with accident data obtained from the Railroad Retirement Board and the Travelers Insurance Company.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One railroad association recommended that, if adopted, internal control procedures should apply initially to only
the larger railroads (Class I railroads). It was further suggested that regulations crafted particularly for smaller
railroads should be adopted in order to reduce the inequities that such railroads seemingly confront when implementing
safety regulations in general. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One railroad opined that FRA should require railroads to implement some specific internal control procedures, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, reporting data should be validated by at least one other internal railroad department source. As an alternative
to specific, prescribed procedures, it was recommended that railroads develop and file an ``action plan'' describing
how the railroad would validate its data with another impartial internal source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters did not support GAO's recommendation for civil penalties for inaccurate reporting due to internal
control weakness. A few stated that civil penalties should be assessed only for violations that are recurring, willful,
or grossly negligent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA's Operating Practices inspectors have significantly increased the amount of time spent reviewing railroad
accident reporting records. The internal control procedures of all the large railroads and a sampling of the small
railroads have been reviewed and analyzed by these inspectors and the results compared with GAO's earlier findings.
FRA found that these railroads have generally improved their internal control procedures and their accident/incident
reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA's recent review of the accident/incident reporting procedures of all of the major railroads and a large number
of smaller railroads supports the GAO findings that errors in reporting resulted principally from the railroads'
lack of internal control procedures. Railroads with specific internal control procedures in place had far more accurate
reporting records. FRA also found that most non-reporting or inaccurate reporting was due to a communication breakdown
between the claims department, which maintained medical records, and the other railroad departments, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, operating, mechanical, and maintenance-of-way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA therefore proposes, in new &sect;225.33(a), that each railroad must prepare and maintain an Internal Control
Plan, that requires institution of proper internal control procedures for reporting. Such a Plan would ensure the
reconciliation and incorporation of accident/incident and injury/illness data from the various departments within
the railroad for submission to the railroad reporting officer. The reporting office must have access to all pertinent
claims records, including medical records and payroll records. Further, the reporting office must be notified by
claims and medical departments of each new case/claim opened by a railroad worker. Identification of offices and
responsible railroad officers would also aid FRA in identification of procedural weaknesses in reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA believes that requiring railroads to establish an Internal Control Plan for reporting would ensure more accurate
injury and accident reporting. Once in place, FRA inspections would focus on the procedures the railroads use to report
injuries and accidents. This periodical review of the Plan by FRA would detect procedural deficiencies and would
enable the railroad to correct any identified problems. Thus, new &sect;225.33(b) proposes that each railroad not
only have an Internal Control Plan, but also that all reasonable effort is made to adhere to that Plan. If FRA should
find the railroad to be in noncompliance, FRA may cite that railroad for violating procedural requirements and require
the railroad to correct the procedural weakness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, this NPRM proposes, in new &sect;225.41, that the Internal Control Plan shall, upon request, be made
available to any FRA or State safety inspector for examination and photocopying in a reasonable manner during normal
business hours. Proposed &sect;225.41 is discussed in greater detail in this NPRM under the heading ``Miscellaneous
Amendments.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to resolve the discrepancies between the annual report for lost workdays and the monthly submission of lost
workdays, FRA began in January 1990 to allow the railroads to update their portion of the accident and casualty database
using magnetic media. In this NPRM, the term ``magnetic media'' means computer diskettes and magnetic tapes. Currently,
railroads are allowed to update certain fields on existing records (``Days Lost,'' ``Restricted Days,'' ``Cause
Code,'' ``Alcohol and Drug Code,'' ``Damages,'' ``Total Injuries,'' and ``Total Killed''). New submissions must
be submitted on existing paper forms as existing provisions of part 225 do not allow transfer of data by means of magnetic
media as an alternative means of compliance. Updating the information via a magnetic medium remained voluntary on
the part of the railroad, and this procedure, along with paper form updates, has improved the overall accuracy of information
submitted monthly particularly with respect to the number of lost workdays.

Comments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA solicited comments in the ANPRM regarding a proposal to allow railroads the option to report accidents/incidents
by way of magnetic media transfer in lieu of the paper (``hard copy'') forms currently submitted. Most commenters
expressed an interest in implementing some kind of electronic transmission and exchange of data from the railroads
to FRA. One railroad suggested that FRA implement the program to ensure timely and accurate changes to the hard copy
``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54), rather than submitting a corrected hard copy
report. Another railroad emphasized that implementation of a magnetic media program was a concept long overdue and
predicted a reduction in the amount of annual key-punching labor cost. One rail association encouraged implementation
of a magnetic media program as it would ensure timely reporting and a less expensive medium than submission of hard
copies. It was also suggested that FRA should provide smaller railroads the appropriate software for their personal
computers. Another railroad recommended that FRA review the feasibility of reporting accidents/incidents telephonically
as well as by magnetic media. In reference to the initial cost to implement the program, the majority of the railroads
anticipated a one-time start-up cost which would be necessary to implement the data transfer process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of the favorable responses to the ANPRM, FRA proposes, in new &sect;225.37, to amend the current reporting
requirements and allow railroads the option of using magnetic media to transmit both the initial and updated versions
of the following reports: (a) the ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54), (b) the ``Railroad
Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55a), and (c) the ``Highway-Rail Grade Crossing
Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.57). Reporting requirements for magnetic media transfer would be similar
to the current hard copy reporting requirements currently stated in &sect;225.11; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, reports submitted via magnetic media would be due within 30 days after expiration of the month in which the accident/incident
occurred.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA has initially determined that use of a public standard (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, National Institute of Standards and Technology XII Standard) electronic data interchange (EDI), whereby accident
and incident data would be available to FRA in a short time period, is not only too expensive for the railroads to implement
but also inefficient for the types of files that would be transferred to FRA. In order for FRA to effectively assess
any modem-to-modem (computer-to-computer) private format EDI submission of accident and incident reports, many
more railroads will need to submit their data on magnetic media. A decision on use of modem-to-modem submissions of
accident/incident reports would be made once FRA gauges (a) the number of submissions by railroads willing to take
part in this voluntary program and (b) the size (number of characters) of the submissions. In order to accomplish this,
FRA will carefully monitor and assess all initial magnetic media submissions supplied by the railroads choosing
the magnetic media option.

Computer Magnetic Media Transfer Option (Proposed &sect;225.37(a)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In particular, FRA proposes, in new &sect;225.37(a), to allow the railroads, subject to various conditions, the
option to submit magnetic media that contain: (a) initial accident/incident reports, (b) updates or amendments
to all reports previously submitted in hard copy, and (c) updates or amendments to reports initially transmitted
on magnetic media. Railroads would be allowed to provide FRA with magnetic media in the form of either a magnetic tape
(EBCDIC) fixed format, an ASCII diskette-fixed format, a DBF diskette, or a delimited diskette. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The magnetic media option also would allow railroads to continue to submit hard copy reports, as the current regulations
require, but to update the data contained on the hard copy by way of magnetic media. Alternatively, railroads would
have the option to utilize magnetic media exclusively for all initial reports and all updates and amendments to those
reports. Further, all transmissions of updated or amended reports by means of magnetic media would be added to a year-to-date
file created exclusively for each reporting railroad. This year-to-date file would include all updates and amendments
on reported accidents and incidents and would be maintained by FRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Railroads that choose to submit their data via magnetic media would remain responsible for having on file hard copies
of the reports identified in &sect;225.21. Therefore, FRA proposes, in new &sect;225.27(c), that each railroad
must maintain on file, at a central location(s) designated by the railroad, a signed copy of both the ``Rail Equipment
Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54) and the ``Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Form FRA F 6180.57), as well as a copy of all other reports filed with FRA. This requirement is also meant to include
a hard copy of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 record submitted via magnetic media. Maintaining files at an identified central location would enable both federal
and State inspectors, as well as authorized representatives, a means by which to verify whether the railroad reported
a specific accident/incident or injury to FRA.

Computer Magnetic Media Transfer Requirements (Proposed &sect;225.37(b)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposes, in new &sect;225.37(b), to require that when a railroad utilizes the magnetic media option, whether
to submit an initial report, or an updated or amended report, it shall submit along with the magnetic media: (a) a sworn
report, as required by 49 U.S.C. 20901 (formerly contained at &sect;1 of the Accident Reports Act, 45 U.S.C. 38), in
the form of a notarized ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (Form FRA F 6180.55), and (b) a signed ``Batch Control
Form'' for magnetic media. The requirement to submit a notarized Form FRA F 6180.55 would ensure that railroad reporting
officials attest to the validity of the information reported to FRA in the magnetic media and would provide FRA with
evidence necessary to hold those officials accountable for false reporting. The ``Batch Control Form'' for magnetic
media, also signed by the railroad's reporting officer, would describe the type of report, number of reports, persons
injured, rail damage, lost workdays, etc., for each type of accident/incident reported on the magnetic media. By
signing the ``Batch Control Form,'' the railroad reporting official would attest that the data contained in the magnetic
media agrees with the data forwarded by the railroads in Forms FRA F 6180.54, 6180.55a, and 6180.57. FRA proposes to
print the ``Batch Control Form'' on the back of the ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (FRA Form F 6180.55). The
format of the proposed ``Batch Control Form'' is set forth in Appendix 1 to this NPRM.

Computer Magnetic Media Assimilation Period (Proposed &sect;225.37(c)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the magnetic media option is a fairly new concept, FRA proposes, in new &sect;225.37(c), to require the railroads
that utilize this medium to initially include the hard copy of the particular accident/incident report with the magnetic
media. During this assimilation period, FRA will compare the data on hard copy reports to the data contained in the
magnetic media to determine if the information reported via magnetic media is consistent and reliable. This requirement
would ensure quality control and would provide FRA a measure by which to gauge accurate reporting. After a three-month
period of 100-percent accuracy verification, FRA will notify the railroad that the hard copy is no longer necessary.
Of course, this process may take longer than three months if the hard copy reports do not agree with the magnetic media
submission. If the data in the hard copy is inconsistent with the data in the magnetic media, FRA may require that particular
railroad to continue to submit hard copies until both the hard copy and the magnetic media reflect the same information.
Once the data on both the hard copies and magnetic media agree, FRA will notify the railroad reporting official to discontinue
submitting hard copies. However, there would always remain the requirement that railroads submit a hard copy notarized
Form FRA F 6180.55 as well as the signed hard copy ``Batch Control Form.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA believes that providing the magnetic media transfer option for reporting accidents/incidents would ensure
faster, more accurate reporting by railroads. The initial start-up cost to railroads is expected to be minimal. FRA
would provide initial computer diskettes and technical advice to railroads that use the option. Moreover, railroads
would be provided with the opportunity to correct or amend the hard copy reports or initial reports in magnetic media
within the 30-day reporting period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA received a multitude of comments regarding the currently used reporting forms. In general, it was recommended
that all forms be revised to reflect recent regulatory changes and new operating practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned previously, FRA has had open informal meetings with the AAR Committee for Uniformity in Reporting. The
American Short Line Railroad Association (ASLRA) representing the small railroad industry as well as counsel for
the Railway Labor Executives' Association (RLEA) were in attendance at these open meetings. These meetings detailed
changes in cause codes for train accidents and expansion of the illness codes. Suggestions were also made to restructure
the ``FRA Guide for Reporting Accidents/Incidents'' (``FRA Guide''). It was suggested that FRA should develop easy-to-follow
directions for any new reporting requirements. Most of the changes were studied by FRA and implemented in 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Below is a discussion of each reporting form followed by recommended changes to that form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Form FRA F 6180.45_``Annual Summary Report of Railroad Injury and Illness'': Elimination of This Form and Transfer
of Certain Information Blocks to Other Forms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Form FRA F 6180.45 has been used by the rail industry to report all deaths, injuries, and occupational illnesses of
on-duty railroad employees that occurred during the calendar year. 49 CFR 225.21(f). FRA proposes to eliminate the
requirement for submission of the ``Annual Summary Report of Railroad Injury and Illness'' (Form FRA F 6180.45) for
the reasons set forth below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original instructions for reporting required railroads to make a ``good faith'' estimate of the number of days
a worker was expected to be absent from work or on restricted duty following an injury or occupational illness. The
annual report filed with the December submission was used to provide a summary total of the actual number of such days.
FRA then used the reported information on individual incidents for its analyses. Because the total count of days found
on the annual report cannot be assigned to individual cases, FRA found it necessary to amend its instructions several
years ago to require railroads to provide an update for any case where the count of days on the report filed with FRA varied
by more than ten percent from the actual count of such days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA accepts updates made on magnetic media, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, diskettes and tapes. Several railroads provide monthly updates in conjunction with the report for the current month
and must provide a final accounting by April 15 of the following year. With the exception of the column used to identify
terminations and permanent transfers, a duplicate of the breakdown of cases can be prepared by summarizing the individual
cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information regarding terminations or permanent transfers is currently found in column ``8'' on the annual summary
report. This column lists the number of cases in column ``3'' (Total Lost Workday Cases) and column ``7'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Non-fatal Cases Without Lost Workdays) that resulted in either the termination or the permanent transfer of the
employee for reasons related to the sustained injury or occupational illness. Because FRA proposes to eliminate
the requirement for submission of Form FRA F 6180.45, and since FRA deems the information under ``Terminations or
Transfers'' important for accurate injury and illness data analysis, FRA proposes to move the block designated ``Terminations
or Permanent Transfers'' over to block ``5v'' on the proposed ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation
Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55a). Moving this data block to Form FRA F 6180.55a would enable FRA to continue to collect
this relevant information while at the same time eliminating the requirement to complete the annual summary report
(Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.45). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the same reasons set forth above, FRA is proposing to move the blocks that solicit information on ``establishments
included in this report'' and ``average employment in reporting year'' on the annual summary report to the proposed
``Annual Railroad Report of Worker Hours and Casualties, by State'' (Form FRA F 6180.56).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Collisions, derailments, explosions, fires, acts of God, and other events involving the operation of standing or
moving on-track equipment resulting in more than $6,300 of reportable damage must be reported using Form FRA F 6180.54.
49 CFR 225.19(c) and 225.21(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments received in response to the ANPRM, FRA proposes to make limited changes to the ``Rail Equipment
Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54). The purpose of these proposed changes is to improve FRA's accident
analysis capability. The format of the proposed Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.54 is set forth in Appendix 2 to this NPRM. The currently used Form is provided in Appendix 3 for comparison and
reference purposes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special Study Blocks (SSB).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The first proposed change would be the establishment of three new blocks on Form FRA F 6180.54, each designated as a
``Special Study Block'' (SSB) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 item ``49'' on the proposed Form). Over the years, FRA and other agencies and associations have frequently wanted
to collect information on specific accident issues over a specified time period in response to particular risks of
immediate safety concern. Because of the difficult and time-consuming task of revising and receiving approval for
permanent changes to the reporting form, FRA has not been able to respond quickly in these situations and has had to
rely on labor-intensive field surveys by regional FRA personnel and the informal cooperation of the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA proposes to establish three SSB's for the purpose of temporarily collecting information on these issues of immediate
safety concern. When one or more critical safety issues arise, FRA would notify the railroad reporting officers and
request that they, for a specified time-frame, collect and report on the critical issues using the SSB. Upon expiration
of the pre-defined time period, the SSB would not be used again until the next issues of immediate concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting definitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed changes to the reporting definitions for Form FRA F 6180.54 address perceived deficiencies and inconsistencies
regarding the area labelled ``PROPERTY DAMAGE'' on the current form in blocks ``33'' and ``34.'' The inconsistencies
result from a lack of clear direction to the industry on the issue of overhead and fringe expenses. Some railroads include
overhead and fringe expenses in their estimates of damage, some include one and not the other, some include neither,
and some may not even report the same way every time. These inconsistencies diminish the quality of the accident data
and taint any analysis of that data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA would like to improve the consistency of the information collected on damage costs. FRA proposes to make it clear
that when estimating damage costs, the labor costs to be reported are only the direct labor costs to the railroad, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, hourly wages, transportation costs, and hotel expenses. Thus, for example, the cost of fringe benefits would be

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
excluded
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 when calculating direct labor costs. This clarification should result in greater uniformity in reporting among
the railroads. For services performed by a contractor, the railroad would estimate a direct hourly labor cost by multiplying
the contractor's total labor hours charged to the railroad by the applicable direct hourly wage rate for a railroad
worker in that particular craft.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA also proposes to make it clear that overhead is to be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
excluded
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from damage costs. FRA does not wish to dictate a specific rate for overhead, but it also finds the non-uniform treatment
of overhead under the current process to be unacceptable. Rather than have damage estimates that have an unknown level
of overhead, FRA has decided to propose excluding overhead from the direct damage estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, material costs would be calculated based upon the costs of acquiring new material, even if the railroad chooses
to use refurbished or used material in their actual repairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the proposed changes in the reporting definitions would allow the industry maximum flexibility in cost
accounting and management, and would not dictate set practices to restrict that flexibility, but would require enough
disclosure of the practices used so that FRA could convert the information to common terms before any analysis is performed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Filing of an Amended Form FRA F 6180.54.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the time the ANPRM for accident reporting was published, the FRA Guide provided that Form FRA F 6180.54 was to be amended
if, after filing, it was determined that the damage estimate ``was significantly in error *&blank;*&blank;*.''
Since the term ``significantly'' was not defined in the FRA Guide at that time, railroads used varying definitions
of ``significant'' differences and, as a result, submitted few updated accident reports. Because of the doubt as
to the definition of the term, the majority of commenters proposed that ``significantly'' be defined as at least a
ten-percent change in the estimated or actual damages submitted to FRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments, the FRA Guide was changed to specifically provide that an amended report be filed only
if subsequently acquired information showed the damage to be at least a ten-percent variance from the amount originally
reported to FRA (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Railroad Injury and Illness (Continuation Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55a) collects information about injuries,
fatalities, and illnesses of railroad workers, trespassers, contractors, and passengers and about highway-rail
grade crossing injuries and fatalities. 49 CFR 225.19(d) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
225.21(c). Only the barest of information is currently available on Form FRA F 6180.55a: the railroad reporting the
incident, the State in which the incident occurred, type of person injured or ill, age, type of injury or illness, what
the person was doing at the time of the incident, and, for railroad workers, the number of workdays lost and restricted
and the results of administered alcohol/drug tests. FRA does not believe the information currently requested on
Form FRA F 6180.55a is sufficient for analyzing the causal factors related to injuries and illnesses. FRA thus proposes
numerous changes to the Form in order to collect data that would aid in development of railroad injury and accident
prevention programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The format of the proposed Form FRA F 6180.55a is set forth in Appendix 4 to this NPRM. Appendix 5, the currently used
``Railroad Injury and Illness (Continuation Sheet)'' is provided for comparison purposes.

Exposure to hazardous materials.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When a railroad accident causes a release of hazardous materials, FRA cannot determine, using Form FRA F 6180.55a
as it now stands, if any injuries are associated with the hazardous materials release. There is an increased need for
information on the number of persons injured or killed due to exposure to hazardous materials. FRA thus proposes to
add an additional block ``5u'' on Form FRA F 6180.55a to collect data on the number of injuries, as well as type of injury
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

County/day of month/time of day.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When there is an injury that is not caused by a train accident or highway-rail grade crossing accident, FRA presently
cannot determine the county of the incident or the exact date of the incident since the current Form requires railroads
to report only the month, year, and State. Requiring the county in which the incident occurred in block ``5d'' will
assist FRA safety inspectors in determining which sites or railroad shops have more injuries or illnesses. Requiring
the exact date, including the day of the month, in block ``5b'' and time of day in block ``5c'' will assist FRA safety
inspectors in records inspection. It will also assist the railroad industry in determining whether more accidents
occur on certain days or times of the week.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Gender/ethnicity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA proposes requiring the gender and ethnicity of the person injured or ill in an effort to help identify whether particular
groups of individuals, particularly trespassers, are more susceptible than others to certain injuries and illnesses.
Language barriers or unfamiliarity with road signs, especially railroad crossing signs, may contribute to many
of the accidents that occur at highway-rail grade crossings. Submission of information on gender in block ``5h''
and ethnicity in ``5i'' would furnish FRA with the data relevant to demonstrate whether or not this is in fact the case.
If the data collected in these blocks showed that particular ethnic groups were more prone to certain injuries and
accidents, then FRA would attempt to identify what the exact problem is and then develop remedial programs or other
appropriate policies and procedures to prevent recurrence of such injuries and accidents in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Circumstance codes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When there is an injury that is not associated with a rail equipment accident, the only information about the incident
currently collected is (i) what the person was doing at the time of the incident and (ii) the type of injury. This is not
sufficient data for safety analysis. For example, if an individual received an electric shock while using portable
power tools, there is no way to determine, under the current reporting system, whether the cause of the incident was
defective equipment, improper use of equipment, undesired contact with a power line or box, or some other circumstance
such as stepping on a power line. FRA needs to collect ``cause'' or ``circumstance'' codes for such injuries and illnesses.
FRA thus proposes to develop new codes, in addition to those currently used, to describe the cause and/or circumstance
of such incidents. Appendix 6 to this NPRM provides a list of the proposed circumstance codes that is to be used when
completing the ``Railroad Injury and Illness (Continuation Sheet).'' Specifically, these circumstance codes
would be used to complete the information in blocks ``5m_Physical Act,'' ``5n_Location,'' ``5o_Event,'' ``5p_Result,''
and ``5q_Cause.'' Appendix 6 is merely a preliminary sample of the list of circumstance codes and should not be considered
all-inclusive. The list of circumstance codes, once finalized, would be printed in the FRA Guide.

 As discussed earlier in the NPRM, FRA proposes to eliminate the requirement for submission of the ``Annual Summary
Report of Railroad Injury and Illness'' (Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.45). Data on terminations and permanent transfers is presently collected on Form FRA F 6180.45. In order to
continue to gather this data, FRA proposes collection of this information by the addition of block ``5v,'' entitled
``Terminations or Permanent Transfers,'' to Form FRA F 6180.55a.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Narrative on unusual circumstances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA also proposes the addition of a narrative block ``5w'' on Form FRA F 6180.55a that would allow the reporting railroad
the opportunity to provide details (up to 250 characters) on any unusual circumstance(s) surrounding the railroad
worker's injury or illness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, FRA proposes to amend Form FRA F 6180.55a to require railroads to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Note all injuries and illnesses that are due to the release of hazardous materials and the associated injury problem

4. Form FRA F 6180.55_``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'': Limited Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (Form FRA F 6180.55) is used by the industry to summarize a railroad's
accidents/incidents for a given month. This report must be filed with FRA even when no accidents/incidents occurred
during the reporting month. 49 CFR 225.21(b). FRA proposes to make limited changes to this form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The format of the proposed Form FRA F 6180.55 is set forth in Appendix 7 to this NPRM. Appendix 8, the currently used ``Railroad
Injury and Illness Summary,'' is provided for comparison purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Classifications of persons. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FRA Guide currently classifies persons as: (i) ``Employees on Duty'' (Class A), (ii) ``Employees Not on Duty''
(Class B), (iii) ``Passengers on Trains'' (Class C), (iv) ``Non-Trespassers'' (Class D), (v) ``Trespassers'' (Class
E), and (vi) ``Contractor Employee'' (Class F). These ``person'' classifications are used by the reporting railroad
for completing the ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (Form FRA F 6180.55) and the ``Railroad Injury and Illness
(Continuation Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55(a)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA proposes the addition of ``Non-Trespasser/Off Railroad Property'' (Class G) and ``Volunteer'' (Class H) to
the classes of persons and to replace the terms ``Employee on Duty'' and ``Employee Not on Duty'' with ``Worker on Duty''
and ``Worker Not on Duty,'' respectively. Additionally, the definition of a ``Worker on Duty'' would be expanded
to include individuals (including certain contractor employees and volunteers) who perform either (i) the operation
of on-track equipment or (ii) any other safety-sensitive activity for the reporting railroad.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. New classification: ``Non-Trespasser/Off Railroad Property'' (Class G)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Persons, other than railroad employees, passengers, trespassers or contractor employees, who are injured while
on or adjacent to railroad property are currently coded as ``Non-Trespassers'' (Class D) on Form FRA F 6180.55a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For reporting purposes, FRA would like to distinguish between Non-Trespassers injured while on railroad property
and Non-Trespassers injured while off railroad property. FRA thus proposes to add a new classification of person
to cover those individuals (non-trespassers) who are injured while off railroad property. It should be noted that
an injury ``off railroad property'' would include an injury resulting from an event, such as a derailment or collision,
that begins on railroad property but ends on public or private non-railroad property, so long as the injury is incurred
while the person is physically located off railroad property. Similarly, if a derailment results in a release of hazardous
materials onto public or private non-railroad property and the hazardous material injures a ``Non-Trespasser''
located on public or private non-railroad property, the injury should be reported as an injury to a ``Non-Trespasser/Off
Railroad Property'' (Class G). ``Non-Trespasser/On Railroad Property'' (Class D) would be used to report injuries
and illnesses sustained by such non-trespassers while on railroad property.

2. New Classifications: (i) ``Volunteer'' (Class H) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Volunteer or Contractor Employee Who Is Classified as a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Volunteer'' (Class H) would be added to the classes of persons, for purposes of completing Sections A and B on Form
FRA F 6180.55. ``Volunteer'' (Class H) would be defined to include an individual who willingly performs a service
for the reporting railroad, who does not receive direct monetary compensation from that railroad, and who is not engaged
in either (i) the operation of on-track equipment or (ii) any other safety-sensitive function for the reporting railroad.
Injuries or illnesses sustained by such a volunteer would be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a as injuries to a ``Volunteer''
(Class H). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, injuries or illnesses sustained by an individual, including a ``volunteer'' or ``contractor employee,''
who is engaged in either (i) the operation of on-track equipment or (ii) any other safety-sensitive function for the
railroad, would be reported as injuries/illnesses to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) and ``Worker Not on Duty'' (Class B) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) would be defined as an individual who receives direct monetary compensation from the
railroad and who is engaged in either (i) the operation of on-track equipment or (ii) any other safety-sensitive function
for the railroad. ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) and ``Worker Not on Duty'' (Class B) would replace the presently used
classification of persons ``Employee on Duty'' (Class A) and ``Employee Not on Duty'' (Class B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) would be subject to all of the applicable safety regulations in performance of his or
her activities (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
drug and alcohol regulations, qualification and certification of locomotive engineers). When an individual is
engaged in ``mixed service,'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
performs both safety-sensitive functions and other functions, the railroad would report all the hours for that tour
of service as ``railroad worker hours'' in block ``15'' on the proposed Form FRA F 6180.55; and all reportable injuries
and illnesses would be reported as those to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) in block ``5f'' on the proposed Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.55a together with the applicable job code series of the service performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 209.303 describes ``safety-sensitive functions'' as applying to the following individuals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Railroad employees who are assigned to perform service subject to the Hours of Service Act (45 U.S.C. 61&hyph;64b)
during a duty tour, whether or not the person has performed or is currently performing such service, and any person
who performs such service;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A volunteer operates a locomotive for an excursion railroad. Since operation of a locomotive clearly falls within
the realm of operation of on-track equipment, the hours contributed to the railroad by the volunteer would be reported
as ``railroad worker hours'' on the ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary'' (Form FRA F 6180.55). Likewise, if the
volunteer sustains a reportable injury during operation of the locomotive, then the incident would be reported on
the ``Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet)'' (Form FRA F 6180.55a) as an injury to a ``Worker
on Duty'' (Class A), with the applicable job code series. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A volunteer sells memorabilia at a historic railroad. Since selling memorabilia does not fall within the scope of
either ``the operation of on-track equipment'' or ``any other safety-sensitive function,'' the hours contributed
by such a volunteer would 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be reported as ``railroad worker hours'' and thus would not be reported on Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.55. When such a volunteer sustains a reportable injury, such injury, however, would be reported on Form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA F 6180.55a as an injury to a ``Volunteer'' (Class H). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A volunteer sells tickets for train rides on a tourist railroad and also clears vegetation adjacent to roadbed. Note
that the hours spent clearing the vegetation are reportable on Form FRA F 6180.55 as ``railroad worker hours'' because,
under 49 CFR 213.37, vegetation is to be cleared from the roadbed for safe rail operations and is thus considered a safety-sensitive
function. Any injury or illness sustained by the volunteer during the vegetation clearing would be classified as
one to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) with the applicable reporting requirements for purposes of Form FRA F 6180.55a.
The hours donated selling tickets would not ordinarily be reportable and, if any reportable injury was sustained
by the volunteer during the process of selling tickets, such injury would be classified as one to a ``Volunteer'' (Class
H). If, however, the volunteer sells tickets and then clears vegetation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
during the same tour, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
then all hours are reportable as ``railroad worker hours,'' and all injuries are considered as those attributable
to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A). Therefore, when an individual is engaged in ``mixed service,'' the railroad must
report all the hours for that tour of service as ``railroad worker hours'' on Form FRA F 6180.55; and all reportable
injuries and illnesses must be reported as those to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) on Form FRA F 6180.55a, with the applicable
job code series of the service performed.

Example 4.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The employee of a contractor performs payroll as well as time-and-attendance functions for the railroad on railroad
property. Such functions are not considered safety-sensitive because they are not related to the continued safety
of the railroad. Thus, injuries sustained by this contractor performing those tasks would be reported on Form FRA
F 6180.55a as those attributable to a ``Contractor Employee'' (Class F). Further, the hours contributed by this contractor
would 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be reported as ``railroad worker hours'' and thus would not be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A contractor employee inspects and replaces roller bearings for the reporting railroad. The hours worked by this
contractor employee performing this function would be reported as ``railroad worker hours'' on Form FRA F 6180.55,
and injuries sustained by this contractor would be reported as those to a ``Worker on Duty'' (Class A) on Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.55a. Under 49 CFR 215.113, cars with defective roller bearings should not be in service, thus any activity associated
with replacement of roller bearings is a safety-sensitive function qualifying as hours attributable to a ``Worker
on Duty'' (Class A).

Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A summary of all hours worked by railroad employees during the report year is made on Form FRA F 6180.56 and is included
with the December submission. 49 CFR 225.21(d). FRA is proposing limited changes to this Form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information on ``establishments included in this report'' and ``average employment in reporting year,'' which
previously appeared on Form FRA F 6180.45, would be moved to Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.56 because, as discussed previously in this NPRM, FRA is proposing that Form FRA F 6180.45 be eliminated. In
addition, a column reflecting a count for ``casualties'' would be added to Form FRA F 6180.56. Therefore, the title
for Form FRA F 6180.56 would be revised to read ``Annual Railroad Report of Worker Hours and Casualties, by State.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The format of the proposed Form FRA F 6180.56 is set forth in Appendix 9 to this NPRM. Appendix 10, the currently used
``Annual Railroad Report of Manhours by State'' is provided for comparison purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Form FRA F 6180.57 collects information on accidents and incidents occurring at highway-rail grade crossings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any impact, regardless of severity, between a railroad on-track equipment consist and any user of a public or private
crossing site, including sidewalks and pathways, must be reported on this Form. 49 CFR 225.19(a) and 225.21(e). The
information collected on this report is vital to identifying and resolving problems at highway-rail grade crossings.

Comments

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA received several comments concerning Form FRA F 6180.57. Several commenters expressed concern over the question
asked in block ``32,'' which states, ``[w]as the signaled crossing warning identified in item 31 operating?'' Item
``31'' on the Form currently lists several types of signal devices, including active and passive devices. Confusion
arises when the person completing the report identifies a passive device and then reports that it was not operating.
To avoid this confusion, several commenters suggested that the question in item ``32'' be amended to request information
on whether the device was operating only if the device identified in item ``31'' was an active device. The Form also
makes a distinction between Amtrak and Autotrain in item one. Most commenters recommended elimination of this obsolete
distinction. A few commenters stated that the grade-crossing report required no change at all since the information
requested was adequate and not burdensome and that the Form itself was understandable.

The format of the proposed Form FRA F 6180.57 is set forth in Appendix 11 to this NPRM. Note that Appendix 12, the currently
used Form FRA F 6180.57, is provided for comparison purposes. In order to collect more information on motorists involved
in highway-rail grade crossing accidents, FRA proposes to amend Form FRA F 6180.57 to require information under the
heading ``Motorist,'' if known, on the motorist's age and gender, and whether the motorist was impaired by alcohol
or drugs at the time of the accident/incident (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
items ``39,'' ``40,'' and ``41'' on the proposed Form). Additionally, under the heading ``Highway Vehicle Property
Damage/Casualties'' on the currently used Form, FRA is proposing to delete blocks ``43'' through ``45,'' which request
information on the total number of occupants, and the total number of occupants killed and injured, and replace those
blocks with several new ones (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 items ``48'' through ``54'' on the proposed Form) to gather information on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) the number of highway-rail crossing users (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, pedestrians and vehicle occupants) killed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the number of highway-rail grade crossing users injured, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) the number of railroad workers killed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) the number of railroad workers injured, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(f) the total number of people on the train at the time of the incident (including passengers and train crew), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) the number of train passengers killed, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) the number of train passengers injured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA also proposes to eliminate the distinction between Amtrak and Autotrain in item ``1'' as such a distinction is
obsolete. Additionally, FRA proposes to clarify the question in item ``32,'' ``[w]as the signaled crossing warning
working?'' FRA agrees that the ambiguity of this question has resulted in errors and problems because railroads report
obvious contradictions. The proposed instructions for completing this question (item ``33'' on the proposed Form)
are set forth in Appendix 13 to this NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA also proposes to add two new questions to the ``Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report'' to gather
information on whistle bans and signal system failure. New block ``34'' asks whether a whistle ban was in effect and
observed at the time of the accident/incident. New block ``35'' asks whether there was signal system failure within
the last seven calendar days up to and including the day of the accident. The codes for completing both items would be
included in the FRA Guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a new narrative block (item ``55'' on the proposed Form) allowing for up to 250 characters would be added
to the form in order to gather information on unusual causes/circumstances surrounding the highway-rail grade crossing
accident/incident.

7. Form FRA F 6180.78_``Notice to Railroad Worker Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Worker
Human Factor; Worker Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report'' (Revised Title): Limited Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a railroad should cite an employee human factor as the primary or contributing cause of a rail equipment accident/incident,
then current regulations require the reporting railroad to complete the ``Railroad Employee Human Factor Attachment''
(Form FRA F 6180.81), and attach it to the ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report'' (Form FRA F 6180.54). 49 CFR
225.12(a) and 225.21(g). Additionally, for each employee listed on Form FRA F 6180.81, the reporting railroad must
complete part I, ``Notice to Railroad Employee Involved In Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Employee
Human Factor,'' on Form FRA F 6180.78, and must provide a copy of this form to the worker within 45 days after the end of
the month in which the accident/incident occurred. 49 CFR 225.12(b) and 225.21(h). Upon receipt of Form FRA F 6180.78,
the worker has the option of providing a statement in part II (entitled ``Employee Statement Supplementing Railroad
Accident Report''). 49 CFR 225.12(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recipients of the notice (Form FRA F 6180.78) are to include only those railroad workers who were the primary cause
or a contributing cause of the rail equipment accident/incident. In order to minimize any confusion or misunderstanding
for recipients of the notice, FRA proposes refinement of the language in the block entitled ``Notice to Railroad Employee''
to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice to Recipient. An accident occurred on the above date which the railroad alleges was at least partially caused
by an action, lack of action, or the physical condition of a railroad worker. The railroad is sending you this notice
because it believes that you had a role, but may not necessarily be the primary or only person responsible for the accident's
occurrence. The railroad has reported to FRA that the primary and/or major contributing cause(s) of this accident
are those listed above. Other causal factors related to this event may be described in the narrative portion of the
railroad's report; a copy of which is attached.

Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log (Proposed Form FRA F 6180.xx and Proposed &sect;225.25(a)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 225.25(a) refers to the log of injuries and occupational illnesses at and for each railroad establishment.
It is silent as to whether an injury or illness has to be ``reportable'' to be included on the log. FRA has concluded that
in order to effectively enforce railroad injury reporting, the log must contain 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 injuries and illnesses to railroad workers that arise from the operation of the railroad. Unless FRA has the opportunity
to examine those injuries and illnesses deemed ``non-reportable'' as well as those deemed ``reportable'' by the
railroad, it is difficult for FRA to determine whether a railroad is properly making the ``reportable'' decision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, in order to accurately identify and review both reportable and non-reportable railroad injuries
and illnesses, FRA is proposing to amend &sect;225.25(a) to require that railroads maintain a log of all reportable
and non-reportable (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 recordable) injuries and illnesses to railroad workers for each railroad establishment using a new form entitled
``Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log'' (Form FRA F 6180.xx). The format of the proposed ``Railroad Worker Injury
and Illness Log'' (Form FRA F 6180.xx) is set forth in Appendix 16 to this NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``recordable'' injury or illness is intended to encompass any condition, not otherwise reportable, of a railroad
worker that is associated with an event, exposure, or activity in the work environment that causes or requires the
worker to be examined or treated by a qualified health care professional. Such treatment would usually occur at a location
other than the work environment. The ``Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log'' would be maintained for each operational
railroad establishment, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
an establishment wherein workers report to work. The proposed log contains all the information currently required
under &sect;225.25(a). Requiring railroads to log injury and illness data on the new Form would help alleviate the
difficulty FRA inspectors encounter when attempting to locate injury and illness information at railroad establishments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Updating the Log (Proposed &sect;225.25(c)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Discrepancies in the log are the most recurring problems FRA inspectors encounter during an inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many railroads fail to update the log in a timely manner, particularly with respect to lost/restricted workdays.
Therefore, in order to assure that each railroad continuously updates the log (new Form), FRA proposes, in new &sect;225.25(c),
that each reportable and recordable (non-reportable) injury and illness be entered on the log as early as practicable,
but in any event no later than seven working days after receiving information that an illness or injury has occurred.
Additionally, new &sect;225.25(d) provides that if the log is maintained at a centralized location, but not through
electronic means, a paper copy of the log that is current within 35 days of the month to which it applies must be available
at the appropriate establishment. When the logs are maintained at a central location through electronic means, the
records for that establishment must be available for review in a hard copy format (paper printout) within four business
hours of the request. The ``Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log'' would also be used to prepare Form FRA F 6180.55a
and to update changes in the status of a particular case.

c. Elimination of supplementary record required under &sect;225.25(b). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA has found that much of the information requested in the supplementary record of injuries and illnesses pursuant
to the present regulation set forth in &sect;225.25(b) would be collected on the new ``Railroad Worker Injury and
Illness Log'' as proposed in &sect;225.25(a). Therefore, the requirement that each railroad maintain a supplementary
record, as currently required under &sect;225.25(b), would be eliminated.

d. Monthly list of injuries and illnesses (Proposed &sect;225.25(e)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 New &sect;225.25(e) proposes that each railroad maintain a list of all reported injuries and illnesses for the previous
month and that such list be posted in a conspicuous location at each railroad establishment within 30 days after expiration
of the month during which the injuries and illnesses occurred. For example, the monthly list of injuries and illnesses
for the month of May must be completed and posted no later than June 30th. Moreover, the monthly injury and illness list
would be displayed for a minimum of 60 consecutive days so as to allow all workers at that establishment the opportunity
to view the list. Given the example above, the list, if posted on June 30th, would remain posted for a minimum of 60 days,
or until August 30th. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;225.25(e)(1) outlines the data that would be included in the list. New &sect;225.25(e)(2) proposes
that if no reportable injuries or illnesses were associated with an establishment, the posting shall make reference
to that fact.

Employer notification (Proposed &sect;225.39(a) and Copy of ``Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log'' to worker
(Proposed &sect;225.39(b)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rail labor organizations have repeatedly expressed concern that many injured workers fail to inform their employers
of such injuries. By placing part of the burden for reporting on the individual railroad worker, FRA believes it could
improve the general quality of the injury/illness reporting data. Consequently, proposed &sect;225.39(a) would
require that railroad workers notify their employer, in writing, that they have an injury and/or illness within seven
calendar days of either incurring the injury or illness or obtaining knowledge that they incurred the injury or illness.
A railroad worker must notify his or her employer of both reportable injuries and illnesses and non-reportable, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ``recordable'' injuries and illnesses. As discussed previously in this NPRM, a ``recordable'' injury or illness
is intended to encompass any condition, not otherwise reportable, of a railroad worker that is associated with an
event, exposure, or activity in the work environment that causes or requires the worker to be examined or treated by
a qualified health care professional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another concern is that injured workers do not have the opportunity to review and verify the information on the accident/illness
report prior to submission of that report to FRA. FRA thus proposes, in new &sect;225.39(b), the requirement that
the reporting railroad must provide the railroad worker with a copy of the completed ``Railroad Worker Injury and
Illness Log'' (Form FRA F 6180.xx). FRA believes that the general quality of injury and illness data would improve
by allowing the worker to participate in the reporting process as set forth above.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the present time railroads are required to maintain a log of only reportable rail equipment accidents. Information
on non-reportable events can typically be found in ``unusual occurrence'' reports and ``morning reports'' that
are maintained at various locations by the railroad. However, there is no guarantee that all of those reports are either
available or complete. As a result, during routine accident/incident records inspections it is often difficult,
if not impossible, to identify the events that were determined by the railroad to be non-reportable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consequently, in order to accurately identify and review both reportable and certain non-reportable rail equipment
accident/incidents, FRA is proposing in new &sect;225.25(b) that railroads maintain a log similar to the injury/illness
log that railroads are now required to maintain pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;225.25(a) using a new form entitled ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Log'' (Form FRA F 6180.xx(a)) (attached
as Appendix 17). A ``recordable'' rail equipment accident/incident would encompass any event not otherwise reportable
involving the operation of on-track equipment that causes physical damage to either the on-track equipment or the
track upon which such equipment was operated and that requires the removal or repair of rail equipment before any rail
operations over the track can continue. A ``recordable'' rail equipment accident/incident, if not tended to, would
thus disrupt railroad service. A scrape or indentation to rail equipment, however, would not make a rail equipment/accident
``recordable'' if routine rail operations over the track can continue without such equipment being repaired or removed
from service.

Property Damage Estimate Worksheet and Record (Proposed Form FRA F 6180.xx(b)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Appendix 18, entitled ``Property Damage Estimate Worksheet and Record'' (Form FRA F 6180.xx(b)) is a proposed worksheet
that reporting railroads would use to determine costs associated with damage to (i) on-track equipment, (ii) signal
equipment, (iii) track, and (iv) track structures and roadbed, as well as (v) costs of equipment rental and operation.
These five cost categories would be totaled to derive the total accident cost. If the total accident cost meets or exceeds
the reporting threshold, then the total cost for ``damage to on-track equipment'' in ``Part A'' would be transferred
to ``block 25 (Equipment Damage)'' on the proposed ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Log'' (Form FRA F 6180.xx(a)).
Likewise, the total cost for ``damage to signal equipment,'' ``damage to track,'' and ``damage to track structures
and roadbed'' in ``Parts B, C, and D'' respectively, would be totaled and this amount would be transferred to ``block
26 (Track, Signal, Way &amp; Structure Damage)'' on the ``Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Log.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

E. Quarterly Accident Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA solicited comments in the ANPRM as to whether a quarterly report would result in more accurate accident data being
filed with FRA. There remains a problem in accurately reporting both equipment accidents and personal injuries.
Railroads submit detailed information on a monthly basis, and in some instances, only 30 to 60 days have elapsed since
the date of the accident/incident until the railroad's certified report is filed with FRA. This does not always provide
sufficient time for the railroads to gather and verify statistics on repair costs and lost workdays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These detailed monthly reports provide the data for FRA's annual Accident/Incident Bulletin. This annual Bulletin
summarizes all reportable railroad accidents/incidents that occurred during the previous calendar year. Monthly
reports are, to some extent, based on estimates rather than actual figures; therefore, the Accident/Incident Bulletin
also reflects estimated data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to remedy this problem and ensure more consistently accurate statistics, FRA considered requiring quarterly
accident reports covering the previous quarter's occurrences. This would provide at least 90 days (and up to 180 days
depending on when the accident occurred within the quarter) during which the railroad could obtain actual repair
data and lost workday information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters suggested that the monthly reports could serve as estimates, while a quarterly report could contain
the actual costs associated with accidents. Others recommended that the monthly report be eliminated and argued
that quarterly reports containing actual costs would reduce inaccuracies. It was further suggested that quarterly
reports should be required to contain a detailed report for incidents where damages exceeded $50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters believed that a requirement for quarterly reporting would not remedy any problems. They recommended
that the monthly reporting requirement should be retained and that railroads should provide quarterly updating
of lost workdays, restricted days, equipment damage, track damage, and other changes, via magnetic media. Others
suggested that the information contained in monthly reports together with the submission of the end-of-year report
is sufficient and that the addition of a quarterly report requirement would create additional work without a concomitant
increase in valuable information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, several railroads recommended that the deadline for submission of the annual report (Form FRA F 6180.45)
be moved from January 31 to March 31. They believed this modification would enable the railroads to reconcile their
actual figures with the estimated figures resulting in more accurate information.

Analysis and FRA Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA has concluded that substitution of quarterly reporting for monthly submission would result in very little additional
accuracy of figures on repair costs and lost workdays. There would continue to be estimates involved due to the lack
of completion of repairs or treatment, particularly the closer the incident to the submission date. Therefore, the
discrepancies between monthly figures and the annual summary figures would continue to exist.

F. Reporting Threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since 1975, FRA has adjusted the reporting threshold every two years based on the prices of a market basket of railroad
labor and materials. The purpose of these adjustments has been to maintain comparability between different years
of data by having the threshold keep pace with accident costs so that each year the same groups of accidents are included
in the ``reportable'' accident counts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current system is flawed for several reasons. First, the adjustment for the upcoming two years is made based on
price levels for the previous year. This may be a good method for identifying what that previous year's threshold should
have been, but is not necessarily a good method for setting the next two years' threshold. Second, the threshold adjustment
has been performed only every two years instead of every year, so the comparability of annual statistics within the
two-year set is less than perfect. Third, the market basket used is not necessarily representative of the labor and
materials consumed in the aftermath of accidents ``at the margin''_those with damages just above or just below the
reporting threshold. Thus, changes in the prices of the market basket may not be a good indicator of changes in the costs
associated with accidents at the margin. Fourth, the data used to calculate the threshold adjustment (the market
basket prices) is collected directly from the railroad industry itself, rather than public sources, which may raise
the suspicion that the data may be self-serving. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress has given FRA some direction for modifying the procedure for calculating the threshold in 49 U.S.C. 20901(b)
(formerly contained at section 15(a) of the Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;365)): ``[i]n
establishing or changing a monetary threshold for the reporting of a railroad accident or incident, *&blank;*&blank;*
damage cost calculations'' shall be based ``only on publicly available information obtained from (A) the Bureau
of Labor Statistics; or (B) another department, agency or instrumentality of the United States Government if the
information has been collected through objective, statistically sound survey methods or has been previously subject
to a public notice and comment process in a proceeding of a Government department, agency, or instrumentality.''
Congress allows an exception to this general rule only if the necessary data is not available from the sources described,
and only after public notice and comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA solicited comments in the ANPRM on the feasibility of a two-tier reporting system in which virtually all rail equipment
accidents/incidents are reported to FRA, as now, but in which those involving a substantially higher damage threshold
(for example, $50,000 or $100,000), would trigger requirements for quicker or more detailed reports.

Comments

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters favored the concept of two-tier reporting for rail equipment accidents and incidents and recommended
that the minimum reportable threshold be raised to $10,000 or $20,000 to eliminate less serious accidents from reporting
requirements. A few railroads recommended that the second tier begin at $50,000 and that the lower threshold be raised
in increments of $1,000 on a yearly basis. One railroad recommended that a third tier be established for reporting
in greater detail those accidents that result in $100,000 or more in damage. A few commenters did not recommend adoption
of the two-tier reporting system because they believed that such a system would require more details on those accidents
that fell within the second tier and thus would create a more burdensome reporting system.

Analysis and FRA Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After examining and assessing the feasibility of all comments received in response to the ANPRM, FRA has concluded
that a two-tier reporting system is not warranted at this time. Adjustment of the reporting threshold, as described
below, would provide FRA with the data it needs to effectively evaluate the true status of railroad safety.

Threshold Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposes to obtain in October of 1994 the latest Producer Price Index (``PPI'') and National Employment Hours
and Earnings figures from the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (``BLS''). At that time, the latest
final figures, as opposed to preliminary figures, would be available to cover the period through June 1994. In October
of each subsequent year, FRA would obtain the latest 12 months of final BLS figures and calculate the threshold for
the upcoming year, publishing the new figure in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 prior to its implementation. FRA hopes to issue a final rulemaking on the new threshold effective as early as January
1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Equation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As mentioned previously, FRA proposes to use data from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS),
LABSTAT Series Reports for calculating the threshold. The equation used to adjust the reporting threshold would
be based on the average hourly earnings reported for Class 1 railroads and an overall railroad equipment cost index
determined by the BLS. The two factors would be weighted equally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the wage component, FRA would use LABSTAT Series Report, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 4011
for Class 1 Railroad Average Hourly Earnings. For the equipment component, FRA would use LABSTAT Series Report, Producer
Price Index (PPI) Series 144 for Railroad Equipment. In the month of October of each year, FRA would obtain from the
BLS, finalized cost data covering the twelve-month period ending with the month of June. The monthly figures would
then be totaled and divided by twelve to produce annual averages. The wage data would be reported in terms of dollars
earned per hour, while the equipment cost data would be indexed to a base year of 1982. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedure for adjusting the reporting threshold is shown in the formula below. The wage component appears as a
fractional change relative to the prior year, while the equipment component is a difference of two percentages which
must be divided by 100 to present it in a consistent fractional form. After performing the calculation, the result
would be rounded to the nearest $100.

FRA does not have data on the specific breakdown of railroad accident damage repairs, thus the proposed weightings
are subject to adjustment should commenters choose to offer information that could provide the basis for refining
the proposed formula. The current weightings represent the general assumption that damage repair costs, at levels
at or near the threshold, are split approximately evenly between labor and materials.

G. Miscellaneous Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of the proposed changes in the rule text are self-explanatory or have been elucidated in the previous portion
of the preamble. This segment of the NPRM outlines a number of proposed amendments to various sections of the rule text.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicability (&sect;225.3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 225.3 defines the applicability of the accident reporting regulations. FRA's delegated regulatory authority
under 49 U.S.C. 20101 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(formerly contained in the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (the ``Act'') (45 U.S.C. 431 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) permits FRA to amend the current applicability sections of its various regulations so as to contract the populations
of railroads covered by a particular set of regulations or to expand them to the full extent of that authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA, as the Secretary's delegate, has had jurisdiction over all ``railroads'' since the Act was enacted. There is
a very wide range of operations that could be considered tourist railroads under the broadest reading of the term ``railroad.''
Tourist railroads have written several letters to members of Congress questioning the basis for FRA's assertion
of jurisdiction. Additionally, in 1992, FRA received a petition from a scenic railway requesting the need for legislative
and regulatory action for new regulations tailored specifically to the tourist rail industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to clarify the proper extent of the exercise of FRA's jurisdiction, FRA settled on several principles
that will be used as current guidelines. FRA will exercise jurisdiction over all tourist operations, whether or not
they operate over the general railroad system, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
except 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
those that are (1) less than 24 inches in gage and/or (2) insular. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine insularity, FRA looks at various criteria that measure the likelihood that a railroad's operations
might affect a member of the public. FRA has concluded that a tourist operation is insular if its operations are limited
to a separate enclave in such a way that there is no reasonable expectation that the safety of any member of the public
(except a business guest, a licensee of the tourist operation or an affiliated entity, or a trespasser) would be affected
by the operation. An operation is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
considered insular if one or more of the following exists on its line: (a) a public highway-rail crossing that is in
use; (b) an at-grade rail crossing that is in use; (c) a bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial navigation;
or (d) a common corridor with a railroad, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its operations are within 30 feet of those of any railroad. Thus, the mere fact that a tourist operation is not connected
to the general system does not make it insular under these criteria. While these criteria tend to sort out the insular
theme parks and museums, a need to do case-by-case analysis in certain close situations still exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FRA has concluded that part 225 will apply to non-general system, non-insular tourist operations confined
to an installation that is not part of the general system (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it is a stand-alone with no freight traffic but has one or more features that preclude its being considered insular).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Definitions (&sect;225.5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 225.5 lists definitions applicable to part 225. Section 225.5 would be reorganized so that definitions would
appear in alphabetical order and without paragraph designations. The definitions of ``accident/incident,'' ``employee
human factor,'' ``medical treatment,'' ``occupational illness,'' and ``railroad'' would be revised, and the definitions
of ``day away from work,'' ``day of restricted work activity,'' ``establishment,'' ``first aid treatment,'' ``FRA
representative,'' ``non-train incident,'' ``person,'' ``qualified health care professional,'' ``volunteer,''
``work environment,'' ``worker on duty,'' and ``work related'' would be added. The definitions of ``lost workdays''
and ``restriction of work or motion'' would be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Revised definitions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Accident/Incident'' as currently defined, is the term used to describe the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
entire
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 list of reportable events including fatalities, injuries and illnesses, collisions, derailments, and similar
accidents involving the operation of on-track equipment causing reportable damage above an established threshold
as well as impacts between railroad on-track equipment and highway users at grade crossings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``train accident'' is reported 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
when reportable damages exceed the reporting threshold. In contrast, an ``incident'' is an event that results in
a reportable casualty, but does not cause reportable damage above the threshold established for train accidents.
In order to minimize any confusion concerning the ``accident/incident'' distinction and to bring about consistency
between the FRA Guide and other rail safety regulations, FRA proposes to define ``train accident,'' ``train incident,''
and ``non-train incident'' separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, a ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
train accident
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined to include any collision, derailment, fire, explosion, act of God, or other event involving operation
of railroad on-track equipment (standing or moving) that results in reportable damages greater than the current
reporting threshold to railroad on-track equipment, signals, track, track structures, and roadbed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
train incident
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined as an event involving the movement of on-track equipment that results in a reportable casualty
but does not cause reportable damage above the threshold established for train accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the definition of ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
employee human factor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' the reference to ``cause code 506'' would be removed as obsolete and replaced by the term ``train accident cause
codes pertaining to non-railroad workers.'' Additionally, the term ``employee human factor'' would be changed
to ``worker human factor.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
medical treatment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be revised to include any medical care or treatment beyond ``first aid'' regardless of who provided such treatment.
Medical treatment does not include diagnostic procedures, such as X-rays or drawing blood samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the definition of ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
occupational illness
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' the reference to ``his or her railroad employment'' would be replaced with the phrase ``worker's railroad employment.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Railroad
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined as it is in 49 U.S.C. 20102 (formerly contained in the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C.
431(e)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed new definitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A ``day away from work'' would be defined as any day subsequent to the day of the injury or diagnosis of occupational
illness that a railroad worker does not report to work for reasons associated with his or her condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
day of restricted work activity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined as any day that a worker is restricted (as defined below) in his or her job following the day of the
injury or diagnosis of occupational illness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First aid treatment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined as being limited to simple procedures used to treat minor conditions, such as abrasions, cuts,
bruises, or splinters. First aid treatment is typically confined to a single treatment and does not require special
skills or procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FRA representative
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined to include the Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA; the Associate Administrator's delegate
(including a qualified State inspector acting under part 212 of this chapter); the Chief Counsel, FRA; or the Chief
Counsel's delegate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
non-train incident
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' would be defined as an event that results in a reportable casualty, but does not involve the movement of on-track
equipment nor cause reportable damage above the threshold established for train accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the definition of ``

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``qualified health care professional'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
would be defined to include a professional operating within the scope of his or her license, registration, or certification.
For example, an otolaryngologist is qualified to diagnose a case of noise-induced hearing loss and identify potential

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
would be defined to include individuals who willingly perform a service for the reporting railroad, who do not receive
direct monetary compensation from that railroad and who are not involved in either (i) the operation of on-track equipment
or (ii) any other safety-sensitive function for the reporting railroad as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A ``worker on duty''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be defined as an individual who receives direct monetary compensation from the railroad and who is engaged in
either (i) the operation of on-track equipment or (ii) with any other safety-sensitive function as described in &sect;209.303.

3. Public Examination and Use of Reports (&sect;225.7) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;225.7(a), reference to ``Executive Director'' would be removed as obsolete, and would be replaced with
``Office of Safety.'' Thus, written requests for a copy of any report would be addressed to the Office of Safety at FRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;225.7(b), ``Accident Reports Act'' would replace the erroneous reference to ``Accidents Reports Act.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Reporting of Accidents/Incidents (&sect;225.11) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 225.11 would be revised to reflect that reports identified in &sect;225.19 submitted via magnetic media
would be due within 30 days after the end of the month in which the accident/incident occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Primary Groups of Accidents/Incidents (&sect;225.19) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed revisions to &sect;225.19(a) and (b) would remove reference to the current threshold of ``$6,300'' and
would replace it with the phrase ``current reporting threshold of (insert current reporting threshold).'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;225.19(d), which identifies the third group of accidents (``death, injury or occupational illness'')
that are to be reported on Form FRA F 6180.55a, would be simplified to read as follows: ``Each event arising from the
operation of a railroad, must be reported on Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.55a, if it results in (1) death; (2) injury to any person that requires medical treatment; (3) injury to a railroad
worker that results in (i) a day away from work; (ii) restricted work activity or job transfer; or (iii) loss of consciousness;
or (4) occupational illness of a railroad worker. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Forms (&sect;225.21) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the revisions to the titles of the Forms listed in &sect;225.21, reference to ``Class I and II line-haul
and terminal and switching railroads'' in &sect;225.21(b), would be removed as obsolete, and replaced with ``All
railroads subject to this part.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because FRA is proposing deletion of the annual summary report (as discussed previously in this NPRM), reference
to Form FRA F 6180.45 (entitled ``Annual Summary Report of Railroad Injury and Illness'') in &sect;225.25(f) would
be removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed logs/forms discussed in new &sect;&sect;225.25(a) and (b) would be added to the list of forms as &sect;225.21(h),
(Form FRA F 6180.XX_Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log), and as &sect;225.21(i), (Form FRA F 6180.XX(a)_Rail
Equipment Accident/Incident Log). Additionally, the ``Property Damage Estimate Worksheet and Record'' (Form
FRA F 6180.xx(b)) would be added to the list of forms as &sect;225.21(j).

7. Penalties (&sect;225.29) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 225.29 identifies the penalties FRA may impose upon any person that violates any requirement of this part.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who violates any requirement of this part or causes the violation of any such requirement of this part will
be subject to a civil penalty of at least $500 and not more than $10,000 per violation. Civil penalties may be assessed
against individuals only for willful violations, and where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated
violations creates an imminent hazard of death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $20,000 per violation may be assessed.
In addition, each day a violation continues will constitute a separate offense. Finally, a person may be subject to
criminal penalties for knowingly and willfully falsifying reports required by these regulations. Appendix A provides

8. Access to Records (Proposed &sect;225.41) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA inspectors frequently encounter reluctance from the railroads when examining and photocopying claims department
records, particularly railroad worker medical records. New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;225.41 would provide FRA representatives, or any representative of a State participating in investigative
and surveillance activities under the Federal railroad safety laws and regulations, access to all records, logs,
and supplementary records related to (a) rail-equipments accidents/incidents, including collisions and derailments;
(b) highway-rail grade crossing accidents/incidents; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) death, injuries, and illnesses, including claims and medical records, for examination and photocopying (at
no expense to the representative) in a reasonable manner during normal business hours. Further, a penalty has been
proposed for each instance the railroad denies a representative access to any record, log, and supplementary record
identified above.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix B would be redesignated as Appendix A and would be revised to add penalties for proposed &sect;225.33, ``Failure
to adhere to Internal Control Plan,'' proposed &sect;225.39, ``Failure to Inform Employer of Injury and/or Illness''
and ``Failure to Provide Worker with a Copy of Form FRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F 6180.XX(a),'' and proposed &sect;225.41, ``Access to Records.'' Additionally, the dual entries under each of
paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of &sect;225.12 would be coded ``(1)'' and ``(2),'' respectively, to allow the proper
entry of data into FRA's enforcement database. Further, the penalties for violations of &sect;225.12(a) code (2)
would be increased, in light of the 1992 amendments to the Federal Railroad Safety Act which increased the minimum
penalty and settlement to $500.

10. Revision of Title 49, United States Code 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 5, 1994, all Federal railroad safety laws were simultaneously repealed, reenacted without substantive change,
and recodified as positive law in Title 49 of the U.S. Code by Public Law 103&hyph;272. Due to this change, part 225 would
be amended throughout to reference the newly codified provisions.

Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rulemaking has been evaluated in accordance with existing regulatory policies and procedures and
is considered to be a nonsignificant regulatory action under DOT policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,
1979). This NPRM also had been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and is considered ``nonsignificant'' under that
Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the rulemaking is ``nonsignificant,'' FRA nonetheless has prepared a regulatory evaluation addressing
the economic impact of the proposed rule. The regulatory evaluation estimates the economic costs and consequences
of this proposed rule as well as its anticipated benefits and impacts. This regulatory evaluation has been placed
in the docket and is available for public inspection and copying during normal business hours in Room 8201, Office
of Chief Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Copies may also be obtained by submitting a written
request to the FRA Docket Clerk at the above address.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) requires a review of proposed rules to assess their impact on small entities, unless the Secretary certifies that
the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. There is no direct or
indirect economic impact on small units of government, businesses, or other organizations. Therefore, it is certified
that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under
the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

FRA has endeavored to keep the burden associated with this proposal as simple and minimal as possible. The sections
that contain the new and/or revised information collection requirements and the estimated time to fulfill each requirement
are set forth in the table below. Note that for easy reference, when an information collection requirement has been
revised, the old burden estimate appears in parentheses beside the new burden.

1A penalty may be assessed against an individual only for a willful violation. The Administrator reserves the right
to assess a penalty of up to $20,000 for any violation where circumstances warrant. See 49 CFR part 209, appendix A.
A failure to comply with &sect;225.23 constitutes a violation of &sect;225.11. For purposes of &sect;&sect;225.25
and 225.27 of this part, each of the following constitutes a single act of noncompliance: (1) A missing or incomplete
log entry for a particular worker's injury or illness; or (2) a missing or incomplete log record for a particular rail
equipment accident or incident. Each day a violation continues is a separate offense.

If status code 5, 6, or 7 was entered, also enter a letter code explanation from the list below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Insulated rail vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Storm/lightning damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Vandalism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. No power/batteries dead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Devices down for repair. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Devices out of service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. Warning time greater than 60 seconds attributed to accident-involved train stopping short of the crossing, but
within track circuit limits, while warning devices remain continuously active with no other in-motion train present.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
H. Warning time greater than 60 seconds attributed to track circuit failure (e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 insulated rail joint or rail bonding failure, track or ballast fouled, etc.).4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J. Warning time greater than 60 seconds attributed to other train/equipment within track circuit limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
K. Warning time less than 20 seconds attributed to signals timing out before train's arrival at the crossing/island
circuit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
L. Warning time less than 20 seconds attributed to train operating counter to track circuit design direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
M. Warning time less than 20 seconds attributed to train speed in excess of track circuit's design speed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
N. Warning time less than 20 seconds attributed to signal system's failure to detect train approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
P. Warning time less than 20 seconds attributed to violation of special train operating instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
R. No warning attributed to signal system's failure to detect the train. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
S. Other cause(s).
