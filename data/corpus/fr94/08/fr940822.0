SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes. The CAA advises that, during
routine maintenance, the locking mechanisms on the pistons of the spoiler actuators were found to be damaged. The
cause of this damage has been attributed to inadequate bleeding of the spoiler hydraulic system. In some instances,
the spoiler operation was out of sequence and may have caused damage to the locking mechanisms on the pistons of the
spoiler actuators. This condition, if not corrected, could result in uncommanded extension of the lift spoiler in
the event of loss of hydraulic pressure in the spoiler actuator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Jetstream has issued Alert Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A27&hyph;034, dated June 9, 1994, which describes procedures
for removal of the left and right spoiler actuators, purging the hydraulic system, and installation of a previously
certified spoiler actuator. The CAA classified this alert service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued
airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent uncommanded extension of the lift spoiler.
This AD requires repetitively removing the spoiler actuators, purging the hydraulic system, and installing an actuator
that has been previously certified. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service
bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ``ADDRESSES.''
All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;124&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

vacuum generator. This amendment is prompted by reports of excessive vacuum generator overloads or blocked rotor
conditions, in which the thermal protection device and/or related aircraft circuit breakers do not interrupt the
power supply. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent a fire in the event of excessive current in the
electrical circuit due to overheating of the vacuum generator.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A340&hyph;211 and &hyph;311
series airplanes. The DGAC has advised that it has received reports of electrical overloads in the toilet system vacuum
generator or blocked rotors, in which the temperature of the vacuum generator motor increases faster than the detection
capability of the thermal protection device and/or the related aircraft circuit breaker. In each case, these devices
failed to interrupt the power supply. This condition, if not corrected, could cause the vacuum generator to overheat,
which could result in a fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Airbus has issued All Operator Telex (AOT) 38&hyph;01, dated December 15, 1993, and Service Bulletin A340&hyph;38&hyph;4013,
dated January 5, 1994, which describe procedures for replacement of two circuit breakers for the vacuum generator.
Existing circuit breakers, 6 MG and 106 MG, are replaced with faster (20 amp) circuit breakers to provide additional
protection in the event of excessive current in the electrical circuit or overheat in the vacuum generator. The DGAC
classified the AOT and service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive, 94&hyph;006&hyph;004(B)R1,
dated February 2, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent a fire in the vacuum generator. This AD requires
replacement of two circuit breakers for the vacuum generator with faster type circuit breakers which will improve
detection capability of the thermal protection device. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance
with the AOT or service bulletin described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There currently are no Model A340&hyph;211 or &hyph;311 series airplanes on the U.S. Register. All airplanes included
in the applicability of this rule currently are operated by non-U.S. operators under foreign registry; therefore,
they are not directly affected by this AD action. However, the FAA considers that this rule is necessary to ensure that
the unsafe condition is addressed in the event that any of these subject airplanes are imported and placed on the U.S.
Register in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would require approximately
7 work hours to accomplish the required actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of this AD would be $385 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this AD action does not affect any airplane that is currently on the U.S. register, it has no adverse economic
impact and imposes no additional burden on any person. Therefore, notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary
and the amendment may be made effective in less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.

considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking action would be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;105&hyph;AD.''

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been

all de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes, that requires removal of the aluminum or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brass hardware in the firewall terminal block assembly and replacement with steel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hardware. This amendment is prompted by the results of an investigation, which revealed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that corroded aluminum washers in the DC firewall terminal block assembly may loosen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the electrical connections. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interruption of DC electrical power due to connections that may have loosened from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to all de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19154). That action proposed to require removal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the aluminum or brass hardware in the firewall terminal block assembly and replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with steel hardware (Modification 7/2617).

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 55 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is estimated to be $9,075, or $165 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment revises an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM)
(formerly Bendix) S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, S&hyph;600, and S&hyph;1200 series magnetos, that currently requires
replacing Bendix ignition coils and rotating magnets, regardless of total time in service (TIS), with improved TCM
ignition coils, rotating magnets and marking magnetos to indicate compliance with this AD, except for the S&hyph;1200
series magnetos on which the AD requires replacing only the ignition coils as that series magneto already incorporates
rotating magnets with the improved TCM design. This amendment limits the number of magnetos requiring replacement.
This amendment is prompted by a report from the manufacturer that there is an error in the serial number listing of affected
magnetos. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent magneto failure and subsequent engine failure.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 29, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 94&hyph;01&hyph;03,
Amendment 39&hyph;8785 (59 FR 4555, February 1, 1994), to require replacing certain Bendix ignition coils and rotating
magnets, regardless of time in service (TIS), with improved serviceable Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) ignition
coils and rotating magnets at either the next 100-hour inspection, the next annual inspection, the next progressive
inspection, or the next 100 hours TIS after the effective date of the AD, whichever occurs first. For S&hyph;1200 series
magnetos, the AD requires replacing only the ignition coils as the rotating magnets on that series magneto already
incorporates the improved TCM design. Additionally, the AD requires remarking magnetos to indicate compliance
with the AD. That action was prompted by recent reports of accidents caused by failures of magnetos incorporating
older Bendix components that had not been replaced in accordance with superseded AD 73&hyph;07&hyph;04, Amendment
39&hyph;1731 (38 FR 27600, October 5, 1973). That condition, if not corrected, could result in magneto failure and
subsequent engine failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the issuance of that AD, TCM has informed the FAA that an error in the serial number listing in TCM Service Bulletin
(SB) No. 637, dated December 1992, resulted in too many affected magnetos requiring AD compliance. The AD should apply
only to certain magnetos manufactured by Bendix in Sidney, New York, and not to any Bendix magnetos built in either
Jacksonville, Florida, or Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, the S&hyph;600 series magnetos require replacement of
only the rotating magnets and not the ignition coils. Finally, the FAA received reports that there is some confusion
as to how the S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, S&hyph;600, and S&hyph;1200 series magnetos are referenced in the TCM SB and
the AD. TCM has issued a revised SB that corrects these errors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of TCM Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) No. MSB644, dated
April 4, 1994, that describes procedures for replacing certain Bendix ignition coils and rotating magnets with improved
serviceable TCM ignition coils and rotating magnets and marking magnetos to indicate compliance with this MSB.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, this AD revises AD 94&hyph;01&hyph;03 to require replacement of certain Bendix ignition coils and rotating
magnets with improved serviceable TCM ignition coils and rotating magnets. For the S&hyph;600 series magnetos,
this AD requires replacing only the rotating magnets as there is no replacement for the ignition coils. For the S&hyph;1200
series magnetos, this AD requires replacing only the ignition coils as the rotating magnets on that series magnetos
already incorporate the improved TCM/Bendix design. Finally, this AD requires marking magnetos to indicate compliance
with this AD. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the SB described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The errors in the SB have caused an undue economic burden to those operators that were mandated to replace the specified
components of magnetos. This AD action will therefore relieve operators of unnecessary expense, and the FAA is issuing
this AD as a final rule without prior comment. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this
regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good
cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;44.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

 The FAA has received reports of some confusion as to what is meant by S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, S&hyph;600, and S&hyph;1200
series magnetos as referenced in TCM Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) No. MSB644, dated April 4, 1994, and this AD.
A typical example is S6RN&hyph;25, where the S designates single type ignition unit, the 6 designates the number of
engine cylinders, the R designates right hand rotation, the N is the manufacturer designator (this did not change
when TCM purchased the Bendix magneto product line), and the number after the dash indicates the series (a &hyph;25
is a S&hyph;20 series magneto, while a &hyph;1225 is a S&hyph;1200 series magneto).

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, &hyph;300, and &hyph;400 series airplanes
was published as a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 15, 1994 (59 FR 11940). That action proposed to require various modifications of certain evacuation ramp/slides.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter requests that the proposed 24-month compliance time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of the ramp/slides be extended to 36 months so that it will coincide with affected operators' scheduled
overhauls. The commenter points out that the manufacturer of the subject ramp/slides recommends a compliance time
of 36 months. The commenter believes that safety will not be compromised if an extension is allowed. The FAA does not
concur with the commenter's request. In developing an appropriate compliance time for this action, the FAA considered
not only the degree of urgency associated with addressing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the subject unsafe condition, but the availability of required parts, the average utilization of the affected fleet,
and normal maintenance schedules for timely accomplishment of the modification. The FAA finds that the proposed
24-month compliance time represents the maximum interval of time allowable wherein the modifications can reasonably
be accomplished and an acceptable level of safety can be maintained. Further, the FAA took 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account the 36-month compliance time recommended by the manufacturer, as well as the number of days required
for the rulemaking process; in consideration of these factors, the FAA finds that 24 months after the effective date
of this final rule will fall approximately at the same time for compliance as recommended by the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter requests that the proposed 24-month compliance time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification be shortened to 6 months. This commenter believes that a shorter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance time is necessary for continued safe operation of airplanes equipped with the affected ramp/slides.
The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. As explained above, the FAA considered many factors, including
the safety implications, when developing an appropriate compliance time for this AD. After consideration of all
the available information, the FAA cannot conclude that a reduction of the proposed compliance time, without prior
notice and opportunity for public comment, is warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reduce the compliance time of the AD would necessitate (under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act)
reissuing the notice, reopening the period for public comment, considering additional comments received, and eventually
issuing a final rule; the time required for that process may be as long as four additional months. In comparing the actual
compliance date of the final rule after completing such a process to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance date of this final rule as issued, the increment in time is minimal. In light of this, and in consideration
of the amount of time that has already elapsed since issuance of the original proposal, the FAA has determined that
further delay of this final rule action is not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters request that paragraph (a) of the proposed rule be revised to require accomplishment of the modifications
specified only in paragraphs 2.C., 2.D.(2), 2.E., and 2.F. of the BFGoodrich service bulletin cited in the AD. The
commenters believe that accomplishment of paragraph 2.G. of the service bulletin should be optional, since the modifications
included in that paragraph are considered to be product improvements that are not associated with the addressed unsafe
condition. One of these commenters, BFGoodrich, states that approximately 40 percent of the slide modification
kits were shipped to operators prior to the issuance of the supplemental NPRM, and some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators may not have accomplished the modifications specified in paragraph 2.G. of the service bulletin. The commenter
expresses a concern that a requirement to accomplish that paragraph would result in additional costs and unscheduled
removal and maintenance actions for operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs with the commenters' request, and has revised paragraph (a) of the final rule to specify that accomplishment
of the product improvement modifications specified in paragraph 2.G. of the Accomplishment Instructions of the
service bulletin is not required by this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters request that the proposal be revised to cite the latest revision to the BFGoodrich service bulletin
specified in the AD and to reference Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;25&hyph;3028. The FAA concurs. Since the issuance
of the supplemental NPRM, the FAA has reviewed and approved Revision 2 of BFGoodrich Service Bulletin 7A1418&hyph;25&hyph;253,
dated April 15, 1994, which corrects certain typographical errors that appeared in Revision 1 of that service bulletin
and references the Boeing service bulletin. The Boeing service bulletin describes procedures for an alternative
method of modifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the packboard and girt. Paragraph (a) of the final rule has been revised to cite the latest revision of the service
bulletin as an additional source of service information. Further, ``NOTE 2'' has been added to paragraph (a) of the
final rule to reference Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;25&hyph;3028 as an additional source of service information
for modifying the packboard and girt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 1,100 BFGoodrich ramp/slides of the affected design installed on Boeing Model 747&hyph;100,
&hyph;200, &hyph;300, and &hyph;400 series airplanes in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 300 of these
subject ramp/slides are installed on Boeing Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, &hyph;300, and &hyph;400 series airplanes
of U.S. registry that will be affected by this AD. It will take approximately 22 work hours per ramp/slide to accomplish
the required actions, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the ramp/slide manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $363,000, or $1,210 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the FAA has been advised that 40 percent of the required modification kits have been delivered to airlines
having airplanes affected by this AD. From this information, the FAA can assume that 40 percent of the affected fleet
already have been modified in accordance with the requirements of this AD. Therefore, the future economic cost impact
of this rule on U.S. operators is expected to be 40 percent less than the ``total cost impact'' figure indicated above.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplanes, that requires removal of the aluminum or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brass hardware in the firewall terminal block and battery shunt cable assemblies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement with steel hardware. This amendment is prompted by the results of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation, which revealed that corroded aluminum washers in the DC firewall terminal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
block and battery shunt cable assemblies may loosen the electrical connections. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent interruption of DC electrical power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to connections that may have loosened from corrosion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to all de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19152). That action proposed to require removal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the aluminum or brass hardware in the firewall terminal block and battery shunt cable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies and replacement with steel hardware (Modification 8/1984). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 130 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is estimated to be $21,450, or $165 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been

History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FAA Order 7400.9A, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16,
1993, listed Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E airspace areas and reporting points. Due to the large number
and frequent revision of these descriptions, the FAA requested approval from the Office of the Federal Register to
incorporate the material by reference in Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) &sect;71.1 (14 CFR 71.1). The Director
of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by reference of FAA Order 7400.9A in &sect;71.1 effective September
16, 1993, through September 15, 1994. During the incorporation by reference period, the FAA processed all proposed
changes of the airspace listings in FAA Order 7400.9A in full text as proposed rule documents in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Likewise, all amendments of these listings were published in full text as final rules in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This rule reflects the periodic integration of these final rule amendments into a revised edition of Airspace Designations
and Reporting Points, Order 7400.9B. The Director of the Federal Register has approved the incorporation by reference
of FAA Order 7400.9B in &sect;71.1 as of September 16, 1994, through September 15, 1995. This rule also explains the
procedures FAA will use to amend the airspace designations incorporated by reference in part 71. &sect;&sect; 71.5,
71.31, 71.33, 71.41, 71.51, 71.61, 71.71, 71.79, and 71.901 are also updated to reflect the incorporation by reference
of FAA Order 7400.9B.

The Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action amends part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to reflect the approval by the Director of the Federal
Register of the incorporation by reference of FAA Order 7400.9B effective September 16, 1994, through September
15, 1995. During the incorporation by reference period, the FAA will continue to process all proposed changes of the
airspace listings in FAA Order 7400.9B in full text as proposed rule documents in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Likewise, all amendments of these listings will be published in full text as final rules in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The FAA will periodically integrate all final rule amendments into a revised edition of the Order, and submit the
revised edition to the Director of the Federal Register for approval for incorporation by reference in &sect;71.1.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this action: (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866;
(2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and
(3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. This action neither
places any new restrictions or requirements on the public, nor changes the dimensions or operating requirements
of the airspace listings incorporated by reference in part 71. Consequently, notice and public procedure under 5
U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary.

providing appeal rights when a State-initiated mass change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federally administered State supplementary payment level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts results in the reduction, suspension or termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a recipient's State supplementary payments, or when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal administration of State supplementary payments has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1616(a) of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary) to enter into agreements with the States under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the Secretary administers the States' supplementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments. State supplementary payments are cash benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid on a regular basis to individuals who are receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, or who, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but for their income, would be eligible to receive SSI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits. When the Social Security Administration, acting as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary's delegate, has entered into an agreement with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State for the Federal administration of these supplementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments, the State transfers the funds necessary to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these payments to us and we make these payments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients. States that make State supplementary payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but that have not elected Federal administration make the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments themselves directly to recipients. If a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elects Federal administration, we charge the State an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration fee as of October 1, 1993, for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payment we make on behalf of the State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to section 13731 of the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66). A federally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered State supplementary payment is included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same payment with the Federal SSI benefit where both a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payment and a Federal SSI benefit are payable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The payment level amounts of State supplementary payments are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the States. From time to time, States may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change the payment level amounts, either by increasing them, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or by reducing them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our existing regulations provide in &sect;416.1402(b) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction, suspension, or termination of SSI benefits is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial determination. The regulations at &sect;416.2005(d) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that, generally, the regulations in effect for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSI program are applicable in the Federal administration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State supplementary payments. Therefore, any reduction, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension, or termination of federally administered State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payments is also an initial determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 416.1404 provides that we will mail to the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient a written notice of our initial determination, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the right to a reconsideration before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination takes effect. Further, &sect;416.1413b provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a recipient has 60 days within which to appeal our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination that we plan to reduce, suspend, or terminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the current process under our regulations, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider the reduction, suspension or termination of State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payments to be an initial determination, mail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate written notice of our initial determination and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide appeal rights to all affected recipients. We apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this process even with respect to mass changes in State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payment level amounts, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a State-initiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in the level(s) of federally administered State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payments payable to all recipients of State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payments or to categories of such recipients, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due, for example, to State legislative or executive action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many such cases in which a recipient appeals the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction, suspension, or termination of his or her State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payments due to the State-initiated mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change, he or she wishes only to dispute the propriety, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fairness, or legality of that mass change, for example, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to dispute the application of that mass change to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facts of his or her case, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 not to dispute the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit computation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe that this policy of providing affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients the right to appeal the State's action in reducing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment levels in these cases is not required by the Act or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by fundamental principles of procedural due process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, in the past, this policy has had a needless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative impact on us since we do not control, nor can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we alter, the State-initiated mass change. This impact was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated most recently when a large federally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered State supplementary payment State, as a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a State law change, initiated an across-the-board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in its State supplementary payment levels. Over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27,000 affected individuals appealed to us the resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction, suspension, or termination of their State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payments on the basis that the State-initiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass change was unfair to them, and not because they wished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to dispute the resulting computation of their benefits. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vast majority of affected individuals requested benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation at the previously established payment levels, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pending issuance of decisions on the initial appeals, as set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth in &sect;416.1336(b). SSA provided appeal opportunities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals. It then informed them that their appeals were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denied on the basis that SSA had no authority to order the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State to repeal its law and reinstate State supplementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments to their former higher levels. Since States must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the funding for State supplementary payments, in some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases the State incurred additional program costs while the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals' appeals were pending. Processing these actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
served only to exacerbate existing workload backlogs by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diverting scarce workpower resources from other necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service delivery activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The courts have stated clearly that the legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiency of an agency's procedures with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients of public assistance who are experiencing such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandated change in their entitlement will be measured first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under an agency's statute and regulations. If no violation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the statute or regulations is found, then it must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined if the agency's procedures violate constitutional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due process requirements. In

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
472 U.S. 115 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1985), the United States Supreme Court considered whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Food Stamp Act required that an individual hearing be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided for every household affected by a general change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the law. The Court found that the Food Stamp Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguished between an adverse action based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular facts of an individual case, on the one hand, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a mass change initiated by the State or Federal Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affecting the entire caseload of recipients or significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions thereof, on the other hand, with Congress only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contemplating hearings on individual fact-based adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our existing regulations do not relieve us from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing appeal rights to recipients for mass change actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in their State supplementary payments. Nevertheless, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that there is no requirement in the Act that we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a recipient of a federally administered State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payment an opportunity to appeal a reduction, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension or termination of his or her payments resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a State-initiated mass change, if that individual does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not dispute the application of that mass change to the facts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of his or her case. Like the Food Stamp Act, only appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights with respect to individual adverse actions appear to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be contemplated under the Social Security Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to constitutional due process requirements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we believe that those requirements mandate that an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose benefits are reduced, suspended or terminated as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of a State-initiated mass change be afforded the full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure of appeal rights in a matter in which he or she 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disputes the application of that mass change to the facts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her particular case, that is, in a case where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient alleges that we have improperly computed his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits as a result of the mass change. In

397 U.S. 254 (1970), the United States Supreme Court

held that fundamental notions of due process of law required

that individuals who sought to challenge the termination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their public entitlements as ``resting on incorrect or

In light of the

Kelly 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decisions, we do not believe that full appeal rights under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
our administrative review system are required in situations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where claimants are contesting only the State legislative or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
executive action which results in a change in the level(s) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the federally administered State supplementary payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead, under these regulations, claimants will receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of the State-initiated mass change and be given appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights only with respect to the calculation of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual benefit amount made pursuant to the mass change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These procedures follow the rationale of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes from adverse actions based on the facts of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the factual bases or the application of rules to particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facts as is required by the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Kelly 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases where the individual desires to appeal the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction, suspension or termination resulting from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State-initiated mass change only to dispute the propriety, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fairness, or legality, for example, of the mass change, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presents no claim that his or her benefits have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improperly calculated, then we believe that the Act and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedural due process do not require that we provide such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual the right to appeal that action. As indicated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, State supplementary payment levels are established by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the States. Any change in those levels as they apply across 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the caseload of State supplementary payment recipients is, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the most part, a matter within the control and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction of the States. We are required to administer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the States' payment levels under the Act, regulations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the Federal/State Supplementation Agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and have no right, power or authority to find State-initiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mass changes in those levels to be unfair, illegal or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improper, nor can we order the States to increase those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In preparing these regulatory changes, we have noted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's regulations for the Administration for Children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Families regarding the availability of a hearing in cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of mass change in the Aid to Families With Dependent Children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. Those regulations provide in 45 CFR 205.10(a)(5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that ``[a] hearing need not be granted when either State or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal law requires automatic grant adjustments for classes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of recipients unless the reason for an individual appeal is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorrect grant computation.'' We believe that a similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach is appropriate where a mass change in the level of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federally administered State supplementary payment is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of State legislative or executive action.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, because of the futility of affording individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by a State-initiated mass change the opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal the effects of that mass change in cases involving no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disputed facts but only a claim, for example, regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propriety or legality of the mass change itself, we believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is appropriate for us to amend our regulations so as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to limit the opportunity to appeal, and the corresponding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
right to continue to receive benefits pending a decision on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the initial appeal, as set forth in &sect;416.1336(b), only to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those cases involving disputed facts. We, therefore, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revising our regulations at &sect;416.1401 to define a ``mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change'' as a State initiated change in the level(s) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federally administered State supplementary payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to all recipients of such payments, or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories of such recipients, due, for example, to State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislative or executive action. In addition, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revising our regulations at &sect;416.1402 by adding a paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) to state that only our calculation of the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in an individual's State supplementary payment amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which results from a mass change is an initial determination, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to administrative and judicial review, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation of benefits pursuant to &sect;416.1336(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also are revising our regulations at &sect;416.1403(a) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that a determination to reduce, suspend, or terminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federally administered State supplementary payments due to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State-initiated mass change in the level of such payments is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not an initial determination, except as is provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;416.1402(n), i.e., only our calculation of the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change in the State supplementary payment is an initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. In addition, we are revising &sect;416.1403(a) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify that the termination of Federal administration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State supplementary payments is not an initial determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The termination of Federal administration of these payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means only that the State has assumed the responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the issuance of its supplementary payments. The amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State supplementary payments an individual receives will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change because of the termination of Federal administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only change will be that the State will be making the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments. There will be no adverse impact to the recipients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely due to the change. Further, we are revising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;416.1403(b) to explain that we will provide to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients a notice of the termination of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration, although the determination will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to administrative or judicial review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Early in the SSI program, which became effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1974, several States terminated Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of their State supplementary payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there have been no recent terminations, we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revising &sect;416.1403 to clearly state our policy on the effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of terminations.

Comments on Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 10, 1993, we published proposed rules in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 58 FR 42514 with a 60-day comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We received 3 letters with comments. Following are summaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of those comments and our responses to them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Claimants should not be denied the right to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenge a reduction in State supplementary payments below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federally mandated levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal law does not mandate State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payment levels. States are free to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those levels in amounts that they alone determine are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. In certain cases, reduction by a State of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment levels below those established by section 1618 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act may result in the loss of the State's eligibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments pursuant to title XIX. In such cases, SSA has no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to order the State to reinstate its State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary payment levels at or above the levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by section 1618. Accordingly, no purpose would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be served by permitting claimants to appeal a reduction in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State supplementary payment levels below those established by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1618.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations should require SSA to afford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each affected recipient with written notice and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for a hearing, consistent with

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Publication of these regulations will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect SSA's current practice of first sending written notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the recipient informing him or her of the mass change and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its impact on his or her benefit amount or eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before effectuating any reduction, suspension, or termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a result of that mass change. Provision of such written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice is consistent with the requirements of &sect;&sect;416.1402(b), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
416.1404(c), 416.1413b, and 416.1336. Such notice will also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inform the recipient of his or her right to appeal the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination to reduce, suspend or terminate his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment as a result of the mass change. However, that right 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to appeal, and the corresponding right to request benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuation, will be limited only to those cases in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the individual contends that our calculation of the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change in his or her State supplementary payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from the mass change is incorrect. Individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be informed that there will be no right to appeal the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination on any other grounds. As explained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion under Supplementary Information, we believe these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures to be fully consistent with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After a mass change in State supplementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments, SSA must be prepared to carefully explain to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients the resulting adjustment in their benefit checks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and be prepared to handle a heavy volume of calls and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests for information from those recipients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We will ensure that our notice language will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly explain the mass change that is occurring; how it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will affect the recipient's monthly payment; and how, and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what instance, the recipient may invoke his or her right to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeal our determination. In the event of a mass change, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will prepare our offices to respond to an increase in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phone-in inquiries and will issue to those offices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructional materials to assist them in responding to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inquiries. We have initiated these actions in prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances of mass change and expect to do so again as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need arises.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SSA should try to require States to provide advance notice to the SSI recipient community of the State's decision to
reduce State supplementary payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We have no authority to compel a State to provide to its citizens advance notice of its decision to initiate a mass change
in the level of its State supplementary payments. We are generally informed of a State's decision to initiate a mass
change when such information becomes a matter of public knowledge. In the past, prior to initiating a mass change,
we have endeavored to discuss the impact with responsible State officials and expect to do this in the event of future
mass changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Supplementary Information section of the proposed regulations is misleading because recent legislation requires
States to pay fees for Federal administration of their State supplementary payments. This requirement is important
because it may affect the State's ability to pay the cost of State supplementary payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree and have amended the discussion under Supplementary Information to reflect the fact that as of October 1,
1993, we charge States that have elected Federal administration of their State supplementary payments an administration
fee for each supplementary payment made on behalf of the State, pursuant to section 13731 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66).

 SSA should inform each State of the potential loss of medicaid payments that can accompany a reduction or termination
of a State supplementary payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe that all States that supplement the Federal SSI benefit are aware that reduction of State supplementary
payment levels below those levels established by section 1618 of the Act may result in the loss of their eligibility
for payments pursuant to title XIX. Indeed, we periodically discuss with those States the impact of section 1618 of
the Act on their payment levels.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Allowing appeals in mass change cases only if the individual contests the computation of his or her revised State supplementary
payments creates a threshold jurisdictional issue that will further complicate the appeals process and will not
result in a significant cost savings to SSA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree. By limiting appeals only to cases in which the recipient disputes the computation of his or her State supplementary
payment resulting from a mass change, SSA will effect a significant cost savings. Furthermore, by prohibiting the
pursuit of such claims through the administrative and judicial process, SSA will avoid the substantial administrative
consequences that can result when large numbers of individuals who wish only to contest the propriety, fairness,
or legality of a mass change request appeals of reductions, suspensions, or terminations resulting from that mass
change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on our responses to the comments on the proposed rules, we have not changed the text of the proposed rules. In these
final rules, we made only several nonsubstantive changes to the proposed rules. We are, therefore, publishing the
proposed rules essentially unchanged as final rules.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains final regulations relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the export of certain vaccines and to the floor stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax on vaccines held on August 10, 1993. This document also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains final regulations relating to the floor stocks taxes on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel held on October 1, 1993; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on diesel fuel held on January 1, 1994; and on commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel held on October 1, 1995. These regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect changes to the law made by the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1987 and the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993). The regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide guidance relating to the floor stocks taxes, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance concerning the person liable for each tax, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceptions to the taxes, and the time for reporting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paying each tax. In addition, the regulations provide guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to manufacturers of exported vaccines.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund (the Fund) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensates individuals who are injured as a result of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of certain vaccines. Revenue for the Fund is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by a manufacturers tax (section 4131) on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccines. The tax, as originally enacted, was in effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only from 1988 through 1992, but OBRA 1993 applied the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax to vaccine sales after August 10, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA 1993 also imposes a floor stocks tax, which does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not appear in the Internal Revenue Code (Code), on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccines. The floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccines that were sold by the manufacturer, producer, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer on or before August 10, 1993, on which no tax was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed by section 4131, and that were held at the last moment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 10, 1993, for sale or use. The rates of floor stocks tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are equal to the tax rates for sales by the manufacturer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producer, or importer.

Written comments responding to PS&hyph;50&hyph;93 were received, but no

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, the proposed vaccine export regulations and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed vaccine floor stocks regulations are adopted by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasury decision, and the temporary regulations relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccine floor stocks tax are removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All of the comments received on PS&hyph;50&hyph;93 addressed the de 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimis exception to the floor stocks tax. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations provide that any person whose liability for tax does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not exceed $1,000 is not required to report or pay the floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks tax. One comment requested that the de minimis amount be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased to $10,000. The de minimis exception was established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the administrative convenience of the IRS to eliminate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessity of processing returns from persons holding small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts of vaccines and having a small tax liability. The $1,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
de minimis amount is adequate for this purpose and the comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is, therefore, not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment suggested that the exception be applied on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician-by-physician basis so that a group practice (such as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partnership or professional corporation) would have a de minimis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount proportionate to the size of the group. As noted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing the amount of the de minimis exception is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with its purpose. Further, if adopted, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion could increase the administrative burdens of the tax. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, allocation problems would arise if a physician is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in practice through more than one group (such as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partnership and a clinic or hospital). Accordingly, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion is not adopted. The comment also suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
de minimis exception be treated as an exemption and that only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts of tax in excess of $1,000 be reported or paid. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion is inconsistent with the limited purpose of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception_to eliminate small returns. It is, therefore, not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OBRA 1993 makes several changes to the Code with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the taxation of motor fuels. First, effective October 1, 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it increases the rates of excise taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and aviation fuel. The gasoline tax, under section 4081, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases from 14.1 cents per gallon to 18.4 cents per gallon; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the diesel fuel tax, under section 4091, increases from 20.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cents per gallon to 24.4 cents per gallon; and the aviation fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax, under section 4091, increases from 17.6 cents per gallon to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21.9 cents per gallon. These new rates include the 0.1-cent-per-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gallon tax that funds the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trust Fund. Second, effective January 1, 1994, OBRA 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally moves the point of imposition of tax on diesel fuel to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the terminal rack. Third, effective October 1, 1995, OBRA 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases the tax on fuel used in commercial aviation by 4.3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cents per gallon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBRA 1993 also imposes three floor stocks taxes, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not codified, on these fuels. The taxes are to be paid by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons holding fuel on the effective dates of the changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on gasoline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel, and aviation fuel that are held at the first moment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of October 1, 1993, at a point in the distribution chain where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these fuels would not otherwise be subject to the increased tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates. The rate of the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax is 4.3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cents per gallon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on diesel fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held by any person at the first moment of January 1, 1994, if (A) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no tax was imposed on the fuel under section 4041(a) or 4091 as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in effect on December 31, 1993, and (B) tax would have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposed by section 4081, as amended by OBRA 1993, on any prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal, entry, or sale of the fuel had section 4081 applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fuel for periods before January 1, 1994. The rate of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax is 24.4 cents per gallon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel held by any person at the first moment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1995, on which the LUST tax was imposed under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4091 before October 1, 1995. The rate of the October 1, 1995, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor stocks tax is 4.3 cents per gallon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 29, 1993, temporary regulations (TD 8498) were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amending the existing temporary regulations to allow diesel fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the same day (58 FR 68338). On January 31,

1994, a correction to TD 8498 was published in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 4251). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments responding to these notices were received, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but no public hearing was requested or held. After consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of all the comments, the proposed floor stocks regulations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted by this Treasury decision and the corresponding temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations are removed. The comments made with respect to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary and proposed regulations are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments were received. One of the comments suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the requirement that diesel fuel be dyed at the time of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal from the terminal in order to be exempt from the floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks tax was too restrictive and that any diesel fuel held for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an exempt purpose that is eventually used for an exempt purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be free from floor stocks tax. This comment was addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in TD 8512, which allows diesel fuel that was dyed past the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminal rack to qualify for exemption from the floor stocks tax. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments suggested that fuel held in storage tanks below the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standpipe (dead storage) should not be subject to floor stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax. This suggestion was addressed in the preamble to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary regulations (TD 8498) and, for the reasons there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated, is not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notices of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their impact on small business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The principal author of these regulations is Edward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special Industries). However, other personnel from the IRS

Section 13421(c) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act imposes a floor stocks tax on any taxable vaccine (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in section 4132(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Code)_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Which was sold by the manufacturer, producer, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer on or before August 10, 1993; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) On which no tax was imposed under section 4131 (or on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which such tax was imposed and subsequently credited or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunded); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Which is held at the last moment of August 10, 1993,

Rates of tax. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rate of floor stocks tax on each

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The person liable for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor stocks tax on any vaccine subject to tax is the person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that holds the vaccine at the last moment of August 10, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993. For purposes of the floor stocks tax, a vaccine is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held at the last moment of August 10, 1993, by the person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that has title to the vaccine (whether or not delivery to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that person has been made) at such time, as determined under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable local law. There is no exemption from the floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks tax for the United States or for State or local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments. Each business unit that has, or is required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have, its own employer identification number is treated as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate person for purposes of the floor stocks tax.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise provided in this section, if the aggregate amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of floor stocks tax payable by a person does not exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Examples.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A holds 50 doses of DPT vaccine and 60 doses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of polio vaccine on the last moment of August 10, 1993. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not a member of a controlled group. A is not required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report and pay the floor stocks tax on any of the taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccines because the aggregate amount of floor stocks tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payable by A (determined without regard to this section) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not exceed $1,000 ((50&times;$4.56 per dose of DPT vaccine) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ (60&times;$0.29 per dose of polio vaccine) = $245.40). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 D, E, and F are members of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled group. On the last moment of August 10, 1993, D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holds 100 doses of DPT vaccine and 160 doses of polio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccine; E holds 80 doses of DPT vaccine, 10 doses of MMR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccine and 60 doses of polio vaccine; and F holds 20 doses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of MMR vaccine and 10 doses of DT vaccine. Without regard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this section, D is liable for a tax of $502.40 ((100&times;$4.56 per dose of DPT vaccine)+(160&times;$0.29 per
dose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polio vaccine)); E is liable for a tax of $426.60 ((80&times;$4.56 per dose of DPT vaccine)+(10&times;$4.44 per dose
of MMR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccine)+(60&times;$0.29 per dose of polio vaccine)); and F is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liable for a tax of $89.40 ((20&times;$4.44 per dose of MMR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vaccine)+(10 X $0.06 per dose of DT vaccine)). Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the aggregate amount of floor stocks tax payable by all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members of the group ($1,018.40) exceeds $1,000, each member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the controlled group must report and pay the floor stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax.

The regulations in this subpart C relate to the fuel floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks taxes imposed by sections 13241(h), 13243, and 13245 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Act). The tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 13241(h) of the Act is imposed on previously taxed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel held by any person at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first moment of October 1, 1993 (the October 1, 1993, floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks tax). The tax under section 13243 of the Act is imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on untaxed diesel fuel that does not satisfy the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4082 (as amended by section 13242 of the Act) and that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held by any person at the first moment of January 1, 1994, at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point in the distribution chain outside the bulk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer/terminal system (the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tax under section 13245 of the Act is imposed on commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel on which tax was imposed under section 4091 (even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if only at the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financing rate) before October 1, 1995, and that is held by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person at the first moment of October 1, 1995 (the October 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995, floor stocks tax). The regulations in this subpart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describe the specific fuels subject to tax, the rates of tax, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the persons liable for tax. The regulations in this subpart also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide exceptions to tax and requirements for payment of tax and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filing a return reporting tax. This subpart is effective on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does not apply to gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held exclusively for an exempt use. In determining whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline is held exclusively for an exempt use, the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An exempt use, with respect to gasoline, is any use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline (other than use in producing gasohol) that is described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 6420, 6421, or 6427 and that entitles the ultimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchaser to a credit or payment equal to the tax imposed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4081. Thus, for example, exempt use of gasoline includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use on a farm for farming purposes; use in an off-highway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business use; use in certain intercity, local, and school buses; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusive use by a State or local government or nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational organization; and use in commercial aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Gasoline is held exclusively for an exempt use only if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the person that holds gasoline at the first moment of October 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993, actually uses the gasoline in an exempt use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Gasoline is not held exclusively for an exempt use if, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the first moment of October 1, 1993, the gasoline is held for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resale (including resale to a person that will use the gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an exempt use). Thus, for example, gasoline held by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline service station for sale to a farmer for use on a farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for farming purposes is not exempt from the October 1, 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor stocks tax. However, the farmer would be eligible to claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an income tax credit for an amount equal to the tax under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 34 and 6420.

Diesel fuel.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply to diesel fuel held exclusively for an exempt use. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether diesel fuel is held exclusively for an exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use, the following rules in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) through (iv) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An exempt use, with respect to diesel fuel, is any use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of diesel fuel (other than use in producing a diesel fuel/alcohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixture or as fuel in a diesel-powered train) that is described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 6427 and that entitles the ultimate purchaser to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credit or payment equal to the tax imposed by section 4091. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, for example, exempt uses of diesel fuel include use other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle (as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;48.4041&hyph;8(b)(4) of this chapter), use on a farm for farming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes, exclusive use by a State or local government or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit educational organization, and use in an off-highway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Diesel fuel held for use in a diesel-powered train is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not exempt from the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(2) unless the fuel is held by a State or local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government. Thus, the exemptions for use other than as fuel in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel-powered highway vehicle and off-highway business use do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply to fuel used in a diesel-powered train. See section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6427(l)(3) as amended by section 13241 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Diesel fuel is held exclusively for an exempt use only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the person that holds the fuel at the first moment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1993, actually uses the diesel fuel in an exempt use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Diesel fuel is not held exclusively for an exempt use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if, at the first moment of October 1, 1993, the diesel fuel is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held for resale (including resale to a person that will use the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel in an exempt use). Thus, for example, diesel fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held by a retailer for sale to a construction company for use in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the construction company's off-road machinery is not exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax. However, the construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company would be eligible to claim a credit or payment equal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tax under section 6427. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aviation fuel.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not apply to aviation fuel held exclusively for an exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. In determining whether aviation fuel is held exclusively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an exempt use, the following rules in paragraphs (a)(3) (i) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through (iii) of this section apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An exempt use, with respect to aviation fuel, is any use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of aviation fuel that is described in section 6427 and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entitles the ultimate purchaser to a credit or payment equal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tax imposed by section 4091. Thus, for example, exempt use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of aviation fuel includes any use on a farm for farming purposes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusive use by a State or local government or nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational organization, and use other than use as a fuel in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aircraft in noncommercial aviation (as defined in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4041(c)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Aviation fuel is held exclusively for an exempt use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only if the person that holds the aviation fuel at the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moment of October 1, 1993, actually uses the aviation fuel in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempt use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Aviation fuel is not held exclusively for an exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use if, at the first moment of October 1, 1993, the aviation fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is held for resale (including resale to a person that will use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the aviation fuel in an exempt use). Thus, for example, aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel held by a fixed-base operator for sale to an airline for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in commercial aviation is not exempt from the October 1, 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor stocks tax. However, the airline would be eligible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim a credit or payment equal to the tax under section 6427. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exception for gasoline or diesel fuel held in vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel supply tank.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to gasoline or diesel fuel held at the first moment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1993, in the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in &sect;48.4041&hyph;8(c) of this chapter) or motorboat. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception does not apply to fuel held in the fuel supply tank of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a train or an aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)

In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does not apply to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Gasoline that a person holds at the first moment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1993, if the aggregate amount of gasoline held by that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person at that moment does not exceed 4,000 gallons; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Diesel fuel or aviation fuel that a person holds at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first moment of October 1, 1993, if the aggregate amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel or the aggregate amount of aviation fuel held by that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person at that moment does not exceed 2,000 gallons.

Coordination with other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In determining the aggregate amount of gasoline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel, or aviation fuel held by a person at the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moment of October 1, 1993, there is excluded the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline, diesel fuel, or aviation fuel exempt from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax by reason of paragraph (a) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section (relating to fuel held for exempt uses), or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b) of this section (relating to gasoline and diesel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel held in the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motorboat). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
All amounts held subject to tax if threshold exceeded.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax applies to all amounts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline, diesel fuel, or aviation fuel (as the case may be) held 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a person (and not exempt from tax under paragraph (a) or (b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section) if the aggregate amount of fuel held by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person at the first moment of October 1, 1993, exceeds 4,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gallons in the case of gasoline or 2,000 gallons in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel or aviation fuel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the aggregate amount of all gasoline held by all members of the

controlled group exceeds 4,000 gallons. A member of a controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group holds more than 2,000 gallons of diesel fuel or aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel if the aggregate amount of all diesel fuel or aviation fuel, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the case may be, held by all members of the controlled group

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 1, 1993, A holds 10,000 gallons of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline, 6,000 gallons of which are held exclusively for use on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a farm for farming purposes. The remaining 4,000 gallons are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held for use in A's highway vehicles. A is not a member of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled group. A is not liable for the floor stocks tax on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any of the 10,000 gallons because the aggregate amount of fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held by A for uses other than exempt uses does not exceed 4,000

 Every person liable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax must make a return of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 30, 1993, and is a return for the third calendar quarter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1993. A first return reporting only the October 1, 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor stocks tax is also a final return and therefore, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the instructions to Form 720, the box for ``final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1994, by any person if_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) No tax was imposed on the diesel fuel under section

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Tax would have been imposed by section 4081, as amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by section 13242 of the Act, on any prior removal, entry, or sale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the diesel fuel had section 4081 applied to the diesel fuel

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The person liable for tax on any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel subject to the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wholesale distributor or other registered producer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recreational boat operator, or other person that holds the fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the first moment of January 1, 1994. Fuel is held by a person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the person has title to the fuel (whether or not delivery to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that person has been made) at such time, as determined under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable local law.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply to diesel fuel held exclusively for an exempt use. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether diesel fuel is held exclusively for an exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use, the following rules apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An exempt use, with respect to diesel fuel, is any use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of diesel fuel (other than in producing a diesel fuel/alcohol 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixture or as fuel in a diesel-powered train) that is described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 6427 (as in effect on January 1, 1994) and that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entitle the ultimate purchaser to a credit or payment equal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any tax imposed by section 4081 (as in effect on such date). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, for example, exempt uses of diesel fuel include use other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle (as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;48.4041&hyph;8(b)(4) of this chapter), use on a farm for farming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes, exclusive use by a State or local government or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit educational organization, and use in an off-highway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Diesel fuel held for use in a diesel-powered train is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not exempt from the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a)(1) of this section unless the fuel is held by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State or local government. Thus, the exemptions for use other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than as fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle and off-highway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business use do not apply to fuel used in a diesel-powered train. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For circumstances in which diesel fuel held for use in a diesel-powered train may be exempt from the January 1, 1994,
floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks tax, see paragraph (b) of this section (relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemption for dyed fuel) and &sect;47.3&hyph;6(a)(1), which exempts fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that was previously taxed under section 4041(a) or 4091 (as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on December 31, 1993).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Diesel fuel is held exclusively for an exempt use only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the person that holds the fuel at the first moment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1994, actually uses the diesel fuel in an exempt use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Diesel fuel is not held exclusively for an exempt use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if, at the first moment of January 1, 1994, the diesel fuel is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held for resale (including resale to a person that will use the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel in an exempt use). Thus, for example, except in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case of dyed fuel described in paragraph (b) of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fuel held by a heating oil retailer for sale for use as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home heating oil is not exempt from the January 1, 1994, floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks tax. However, a homeowner who uses the fuel for heating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes would be eligible to claim a credit or may be eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a payment equal to the tax under section 6427. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exception for dyed fuel. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The January 1, 1994, floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks tax does not apply to diesel fuel that satisfies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dyeing requirements of &sect;48.4082&hyph;1T(b) of this chapter by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 31, 1994, or by the time the fuel is sold by the person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holding the fuel at the first moment of January 1, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever is earlier. Thus, for example, diesel fuel held by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating oil retailer for sale for use as home heating oil is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempt from the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax if the retailer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or another person has dyed the fuel and the fuel satisfies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;48.4082&hyph;1T(b) of this chapter.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Commercial aviation fuel is held exclusively for use as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies for vessels or aircraft only if the person that holds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the commercial aviation fuel at the first moment of October 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995, actually uses the aviation fuel in that exempt use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Commercial aviation fuel is not held exclusively for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as supplies for vessels or aircraft if, at the first moment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1995, the commercial aviation fuel is held for resale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including resale to a person that will use the aviation fuel as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies for vessels or aircraft). Thus, for example, commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel held by a fixed base operator for sale to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airline for use in foreign trade is not exempt from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax. However, the airline would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible to claim a credit or payment equal to the tax under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 6427.

The October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax does not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial aviation fuel that a person holds at the first moment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of October 1, 1995, if the aggregate amount of commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel held by that person at that moment does not exceed

2,000 gallons.

Coordination with other exemptions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the aggregate amount of commercial aviation fuel held 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a person at the first moment of October 1, 1995, there is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be excluded the amount of commercial aviation fuel exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax by reason of paragraph (a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section (relating to fuel held for an exempt use). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
All amounts held subject to tax if threshold exceeded. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax applies to all amounts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial aviation fuel held by a person (and not exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax under paragraph (a) of this section) if the aggregate amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of commercial aviation fuel held by the person at the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moment of October 1, 1995, exceeds 2,000 gallons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Controlled groups. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A member of a controlled group (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in &sect;47.3&hyph;2) holds more than 2,000 gallons of commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel if the aggregate amount of all commercial aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel held by all members of the controlled group exceeds 2,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gallons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following example illustrates the rules of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this paragraph (b):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
D, E, and F are members of the same controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group. On October 1, 1995, D holds 2,000 gallons of commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel. E holds 1,500 gallons of commercial aviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel, and F holds 500 gallons of commercial aviation fuel. None 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the commercial aviation fuel is held for an exempt use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the aggregate amount held by all members of the group is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4,000 gallons, which exceeds 2,000 gallons, all commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation fuel held by each member is subject to the floor stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tax. Thus, D is liable for tax of $86.00 (2,000&times;$.043), E is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liable for tax of $64.50 (1,500&times;$.043), and F is liable for tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of $21.50 (500&times;$.043).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1996. A first return reporting only October 1, 1995, floor

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA is taking action to approve the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) Inspection and Maintenance
(I/M) State Implementation Plan (SIP), which includes a SIP narrative entitled ``Revisions to the State Implementation
Plan (SIP) for the Control of Ozone Air Pollution_Inspection/Maintenance SIP for Dallas/Fort Worth, El Paso, Beaumont/Port
Arthur, and Houston/Galveston Ozone Nonattainment Areas,'' and Regulation IV, 31 TAC 114.3, entitled ``Vehicle
Emissions Inspection and Maintenance Program,'' as a revision to the Texas SIP for ozone in all four nonattainment
areas and carbon monoxide in El Paso. On November 12, 1993, and on March 9, 1994, Texas submitted SIP revision requests
to the EPA to satisfy the requirements of sections 182(b)(4) and 182(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (CAA),
42 U.S.C. 7511a(b)(4) and 7511a(c)(3) and Federal I/M rule 40 CFR Part 51 subpart S. These SIP revisions will require
vehicle owners to comply with the Texas I/M program in the four Texas ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate
or worse which includes El Paso also classified as nonattainment area for carbon monoxide. This revision applies
to the Texas counties of Brazoria, Chambers, Collin, Dallas, Denton, El Paso, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Jefferson,
Liberty, Montgomery, Orange, Tarrant, and Waller. On May 18, 1994 (59 FR 25867), the EPA published a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Texas. The NPR proposed approval of the Texas I/M SIP submitted by the State. No public
comments were received on the NPR; therefore, the EPA is publishing this final action.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, requires States to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement
new ones. Section 182(a)(2)(B) required any ozone nonattainment area which has been classified as ``marginal''
(pursuant to section 181(a) of the CAA) or worse with an existing I/M program that was part of a SIP, or any area that was
required by the 1977 Amendments to the CAA to have an I/M program, to immediately submit a SIP revision to bring the program
up to the level required in past EPA guidance or to what had been committed to previously in the SIP, whichever was more
stringent. All carbon monoxide nonattainment areas were also subject to this requirement to improve existing or
previously required programs to this level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, all ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or worse must implement a basic or an enhanced I/M
program depending upon its classification, regardless of previous requirements. In addition, Congress directed
the EPA in section 182(a)(2)(B) to publish updated guidance for State I/M programs, taking into consideration findings
of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The States were to incorporate this guidance
into the SIP for all areas required by the CAA to have an I/M program. Ozone nonattainment areas classified as ``serious''
or worse with populations of 200,000 or more, and CO nonattainment areas with design values above 12.7 parts per million
(ppm.) and populations of 200,000 or more, and metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 100,000 or more
in the northeast ozone transport region were required to meet EPA guidance for enhanced I/M programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has designated four areas as ozone nonattainment in the State of Texas. The Houston/Galveston ozone nonattainment
area is classified as severe and contains the following eight counties: Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston,
Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller. The Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone nonattainment area is classified as serious
and contains the following three counties: Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange. The 1980 population of the Beaumont/Port
Arthur area was less than 200,000. The El Paso ozone nonattainment area is classified as serious and contains the county
of El Paso. The Dallas/Fort Worth ozone nonattainment area is classified as moderate and contains the following four
counties: Collin, Dallas, Denton, and Tarrant. The designations for ozone were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (FR) on November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992, and have been codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). See
56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR sections 81.300&hyph;81.437.
In addition, a segment of El Paso Texas has been designated nonattainment for carbon monoxide (CO) and classified
as moderate with a design value below 12.7 ppm., under sections 107(d)(4)(A) and 186(a) of the CAA. See 56 FR 56694 (November
6, 1991) and 57 FR 13498 and 13529 (April 16, 1992). Based on these nonattainment designations and populations, basic
I/M programs are required in the Beaumont/Port Arthur and Dallas/Fort Worth urbanized areas, while enhanced I/M
programs are required in the El Paso and Houston/Galveston urbanized areas.

On May 18, 1994 (59 FR 25867), the EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Texas. The NPR
proposed approval of the Texas I/M SIP submitted by the State. No public comments were received on the NPR.

Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By this action, the EPA is approving this submittal. The EPA has reviewed the State submittal against the statutory
requirements and for consistency with the EPA regulations and finds it to be acceptable. The rationale for the EPA's
action is explained in the NPR and will not be restated here.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered in light of specific technical, economical,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted elsewhere in this action, the EPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result,
the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 1 to Table 3 under the processing procedures published
in the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214), and revisions to these procedures issued on October 4, 1993, in an EPA memorandum
entitled ``Changes to State Implementation Plan (SIP) Tables.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office
of Management and Budget has exempted this action from E.O. 12866 review.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is today announcing an Administrative Stay of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know (EPCRA) section
313 toxic chemical release reporting requirements for hydrogen sulfide (CAS No. 7783&hyph;06&hyph;4) and methyl
mercaptan (CAS No. 74&hyph;93&hyph;1). These two chemicals were added to the 40 CFR part 372 Subpart D list of toxic
chemicals in a final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 1, 1993. The effect of this stay is to defer reporting on these two chemicals while the Agency reviews new
data and information made available subsequent to the promulgation of the final rule. The Agency will make this information
available for public comment, in a forthcoming 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice and will also at that time seek public comment on whether the Agency should propose to delete one or both of these
chemicals from the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. After evaluating the information and public comments
the Agency will either propose to delete one or both of these chemicals or will reaffirm its original findings and dissolve
this Administrative Stay. Today's action has no effect on any aspect of EPCRA section 313 toxic chemical release reporting
other than hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. 11023 (EPCRA) requires certain
facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals to report their environmental
releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such facilities also must report pollution
prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act (42 U.S.C.
13106). Section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and
20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add or delete chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria
for these actions. Under section 313(e), any person may petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the
list. EPA has added and deleted chemicals from the original statutory list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 1, 1993 (58 FR 63500), the Agency published a final rule adding 21 chemicals and 2 chemical categories to
the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) section 313 list of toxic chemicals. The December
1993 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document was a result of a petition submitted to the Agency by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Governor
of New York. The petition asked the Agency to add 80 chemicals and 2 chemical categories to the EPCRA section 313 list
of toxic chemicals. EPA proposed to grant this petition in part in a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41020). In the final rule, EPA added to the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals 21 chemicals
and 2 chemical categories. Included among the 21 chemicals and 2 chemical categories in the December 1993 final rule
were hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. The Agency found that hydrogen sulfide met the section 313(d)(2)(B)
criteria for cancer or other chronic human toxicity and the section 313(d)(2)(C) criteria for environmental toxicity.
EPA found that methyl mercaptan met the section 313(d)(2)(B) criteria for cancer or other chronic human toxicity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Basis for Administrative Stay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the promulgation of the final rule adding hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan to the list of toxic chemicals,
additional information concerning these chemicals has been brought to the Agency's attention. The Agency has also
learned that some members of the regulated community are concerned that the basis for the Agency's final action on
these chemicals was inadequately described in the rulemaking record. Furthermore, these members of the regulated
community have charged that the Agency violated various requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act in promulgating
the final listings of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. These issues are summarized below. The Agency feels
that it is important and appropriate to administratively stay the effectiveness of the listing of these two chemicals
while giving the public an opportunity to comment on these issues and the additional information, as well as to comment
on whether the Agency's initial determination that both hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan satisfy the section
313(d) criteria for addition to the list of toxic chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To that end, in conjunction with this Administrative Stay, the Agency will be issuing a forthcoming 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice which will seek comment on the Agency's initial determination for these two chemicals, the additional information
which has been brought to the Agency's attention, procedural issues concerning the initial final rule, and generally,
comments (and any supporting data) on whether the Agency should either propose to delete one or both of the chemicals
or affirm its initial determination and dissolve today's Administrative Stay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the final rule, reporting for hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan are required beginning with activities
during the 1994 calendar year, with the first reports due on July 1, 1995. Because of the controversy surrounding the
listing of these two chemicals and the decision to issue this Administrative Stay, EPA finds it unnecessary and inappropriate
to subject facilities, some of whom may be subject to section 313 reporting for the first time because of the listing
of hydrogen sulfide or methyl mercaptan, to the burden of collecting release information and preparing to file Toxic
Release Inventory (TRI) Form R reports for the 1994 reporting year. Therefore, pending a decision by the Agency of
whether to propose to delete one or both of the chemicals or to affirm its final rule determination, the effectiveness
of the listing of these two chemicals on the list of toxic chemicals is administratively stayed. EPA's decision will
be made promptly after consideration of public comment submitted on the pending 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Substantive and Procedural Issues Surrounding Final EPCRA Section 313 Listing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Agency will soon be issuing a separate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice and seeking public comment, the following is a brief summary of the issues and new information related to hydrogen
sulfide and methyl mercaptan which support this Administrative Stay. In addition, a brief discussion of the use of
exposure analysis under section 313 listing determinations also follows. This is another issue the Agency will be
presenting in the upcoming 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hydrogen sulfide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Concern has been expressed that the Agency shifted its basis for adding hydrogen sulfide to the EPCRA section 313
list between the NPRM and the final rule. EPA proposed to list hydrogen sulfide because it exhibited chronic human
toxic effects, specifically citing respiratory effects. In the final rule, the Agency agreed with commenters who
argued that some of the respiratory effects cited in the proposal (inflammation, edema, cellular necrosis, hyperplasia,
and exfoliation) were better characterized as acute effects than as chronic effects. The Agency nonetheless listed
hydrogen sulfide for chronic effects because the observed neurotoxic effects, such as insomnia, anxiety, perceptual
ability and cognitive impairments were chronic in nature. Although the statutory basis for the determination did
not change, the Agency cited chronic neurotoxic effects in the final rule and chronic respiratory effects in the NPRM.
EPA recognizes that, although its ultimate finding remained unchanged in the final rule, interested parties may
disagree with the Agency's position that the information on neurotoxicity supports a finding under section 313(d)(2)(B).
EPA believes good cause exists to issue this Administrative Stay to allow parties time to prepare and submit comment
and information on this point. As noted earlier, the pending 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice will provide the mechanism for submitting any comments and relevant information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Methyl mercaptan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As with hydrogen sulfide, concerns have been raised about the basis for listing methyl mercaptan as discussed in
the NPRM and in the final rule. EPA proposed to list methyl mercaptan because scientific evidence showed that it exhibited
chronic human toxicity effects, specifically citing neurotoxicity. The Agency affirmed this finding in the final
rule. Since the publication of the final rule, however, it has come to the Agency's attention that one of the scientific
sources relied upon by the Agency in making this determination may have been inaccurately or incompletely summarized
from the original source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing the available information for methyl mercaptan, EPA relied on Sandmeyer, ``Organic Sulfur Compounds,''
in Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology handbook, a common chemical reference work (Ref. 2). Sandmeyer, in
turn, appears to have relied on another work by Kvartovkina and Moerson, (Ref. 1), a 1974 work published in Russian.
When translated (a translation of the article will be provided as part of the record for the forthcoming 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice), there are a number of additional factors and limitations which may diminish the usefulness of this study
for purposes of EPCRA section 313 listing determinations. For example, the findings in the original study were made,
collectively, for a number of chemicals, one of which was methyl mercaptan. These potential translation and summary
problems were not presented to EPA during the public comment period, nor was the Agency independently aware of the
original Russian source. Given the Agency's longstanding intent to base its decisions on sound science and the potential
problems posed by the above information, EPA believes good cause exists to issue this Administrative Stay to allow
parties time to review the full information and prepare and submit comment on this point through the pending 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Analysis of exposure to hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Several representatives of the regulated community have expressed concern that, in listing hydrogen sulfide and
methyl mercaptan, EPA was unclear in its application of the statutory criteria. Among other things, charges have
been made that EPA's decision not to include evidence of exposure in deciding to list hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan
on the basis of chronic human toxicity was inconsistent with past Agency practice. These charges raise important
and potentially far reaching issues of the Agency's interpretation of its mandate under the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not agree that it has inconsistently approached the issue of the use of exposure analysis in EPCRA section
313 listings. However, many members of the regulated community have expressed dissatisfaction, alleging that the
Agency has neither consistently or correctly addressed the issue of exposure. The Agency believes that a consistent
approach to the EPCRA section 313 listing process is both necessary and important and that, given the charges of inconsistency
with respect to exposure analysis, the public deserves an opportunity to be presented with further clarification
of the Agency's position on this critical issue. A more complete discussion of this issue will be provided in the pending

. As described above, the Agency believes that this Administrative Stay is appropriate and in the interests of justice,
given the allegations of procedural and substantive deficiencies surrounding the Agency's listing of these two
chemicals, and the resulting controversy and confusion in the regulated community. Although the Agency does not
regard today's action as a rule, were it to be viewed as a rule, the Agency believes that there is good cause for issuing
it without prior notice and opportunity for comment and for making it immediately effective. Under section 313(a),
facilities face a current and ongoing obligation to collect information about releases of hydrogen sulfide and methyl
mercaptan. Such activities are potentially quite burdensome, particularly for any facility made subject to section
313 reporting requirements for the first time because of the listing of these two chemicals. Until such time as the
issues described in this document are resolved, EPA believes that today's Administrative Stay is necessary. As stated
above, EPA will be issuing a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to begin addressing these issues and will move with dispatch toward final resolution of the status of these two chemicals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this Administrative Stay is authorized by 5 U.S.C. section 705, which provides that an agency may postpone
the effective date of action taken by it when justice so requires, pending judicial review. No petition for review
has been formally filed as of this date with respect to the listing of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. However,
both the Chemical Manufacturers Association and the American Forest and Paper Association have told the Agency that
unless administrative action is taken to resolve the issues outlined in today's document, a prompt legal challenge
will be brought. These two organizations represent the interests of a large portion of the facilities subject to section
313, including those affected by the listing of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. The Agency believes that rather
than going through costly and potentially protracted litigation, an Administrative Stay coupled with a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice and opportunity to comment is both consistent with the goal of the TRI program to involve the public in the resolution
of important issues and clearly in the interests of justice.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule withdraws regulations setting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth a mandatory budgetary method for determining financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for individuals who are not receiving or deemed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be receiving Federal cash assistance but whose financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for Medicaid is being determined through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of financial criteria of the Aid to Families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. These regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were previously issued as part of a final rule with comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period originally published on January 19, 1993, and were to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be effective October 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule also makes conforming technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes, as a result of this withdrawal, to the remainder of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the January 19, 1993, final rule and reaffirms the August 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18, 1994, effective date of this remaining part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes are being made as a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of public comments received.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 19, 1993 (58 FR 4931), we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a final rule with comment period that amended the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for coverage of certain groups of individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Medicaid and the requirements for determining Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility. Because the new administration wanted to fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review the policies in these regulations, on February 19, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993, we published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9120) delaying the effective dates and compliance dates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule with comment period for 6 months. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dates were extended for two additional 6-month periods in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent notices published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 23, 1993 (58 FR 44457) and February 18, 1994 (59 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8138). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations incorporated into the Medicaid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations substantive changes made in the composition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility groups of individuals and in the criteria used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine their financial eligibility under Medicaid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The substantive changes were initially made by the Omnibus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA '81), Public Law 97&hyph;35, and the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility
Act of 1982 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(TEFRA), Public Law 97&hyph;248, and further amended by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DRA), Public Law 98&hyph;369; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(COBRA), Public Law 99&hyph;272; the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA '86), Public Law 99&hyph;509; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;93; the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87), Public Law 100&hyph;203; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 100&hyph;360; the Family Support Act of 1988, Public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Law 100&hyph;485; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OBRA '89), Public Law 101&hyph;239; and the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101&hyph;508. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the document contained changes made as a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of administrative decisions to improve program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration and efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Basically, the January 1993 rule had two parts with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different effective dates. The first part codified a number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of statutory changes dating as far back as 1981. This part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was classified as a final rule. As extended by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent notices to the January 1993 publication, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date for these regulations is August 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second part of the January 1993 rule set forth a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandated budgeting method for determining the financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility of individuals who are not receiving or deemed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be receiving Federal cash assistance but whose financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for Medicaid is being determined through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of the financial criteria under the Aid to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program (referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as ``AFDC-related non-cash assistance individuals''). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part was classified as a final rule with comment period. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended by the subsequent notices to the January 1993 rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effective date for this part is October 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The budgetary method set forth in the regulations was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed to clarify contradictory provisions in the Social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Act (the Act) that had resulted in litigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Basically, title XIX of the Act (section 1902(a)(10)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that the methods of the Federal cash assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program most closely related to the individual's status be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to determine income and resources for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid eligibility. At the same time, title XIX (section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(17)(D)) prohibits use of some of those same methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without specifying what should be used in their place. That 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is, section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act prohibits the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of income and resources of family members as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to applicants and recipients (unless actually made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available) except (1) an applicant or recipient for his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her respective spouse; and (2) parents for their children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who are either under 21 or who are blind and disabled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of age. This requirement became a problem for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AFDC-related non-cash assistance cases when an AFDC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory change in 1984 mandated that all family members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
living together be considered one family unit for AFDC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility purposes and that the income and resources of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all family members be pooled. As a result, AFDC sometimes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires attributing income and resources from persons other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than spouses or parents (siblings, stepparents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grandparents, legal guardians, and alien sponsors) as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the applicant or recipient. Use of the AFDC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods for cases involving income from persons other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spouses or parents, however, is contrary to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since 1984, courts in a number of jurisdictions have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ruled that section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Act, which limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose income and resources can be counted (unless actually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made available), overrides section 1902(a)(10) of the Act, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which requires that the AFDC methods be used to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases. These rulings left open the issue of what method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be used uniformly among States. Currently, States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are using a variety of methods for determining income for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid eligibility purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to our request for public comments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1993 rule, we received many objections to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
budgeting method set forth in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, we set forth in the January 1993 rule a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prorating method of determining eligibility for AFDC-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-cash assistance individuals. Under this method, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual members of the Medicaid budgetary unit would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their income and resource eligibility determined using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate standards that are calculated based on proration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing standards. Parents' countable income and resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be prorated equally among their dependents living in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the home, including non-Supplemental Security Income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependents who may not be members of the budgetary unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proration would also take into account the needs of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parents. We also addressed how certain types of income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be counted and how certain types of disregards would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We received comments from 13 States and 7 special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest groups. With one exception, all of the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objected to the budgeting method in these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These commenters stated that the new procedure was error 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prone and unnecessarily complex. In addition, they believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the required system and manual changes and personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retraining would result in significant administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We considered these comments, especially in the light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of health care reform legislation. We also worked with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicaid Eligibility Technical Advisory Group (ETAG) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop an acceptable policy. The ETAG prefers a policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that minimizes the disruption of current approaches. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also met with recipient advocates who endorse allowing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States a choice of several options, but strongly oppose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowing the budgeting method in the referenced regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be one of these options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, we are withdrawing the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing the mandatory budgetary method for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals. By doing this, we are allowing States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility, within any constraints imposed by court orders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or agreements with recipient advocate groups, to interpret 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current provisions in the law. That is, at this time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the absence of specific regulatory guidance on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodologies for establishing income and resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals, States will be required to use methodologies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that comply with the statute and any applicable court 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

II. Provisions of the Final Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of our decision to withdraw the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that require States to use a mandatory budgetary method for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining financial eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance individuals, we are making the following changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the January 1993 rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have withdrawn &sect;&sect;435.604, 435.606, 436.604, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
436.606. These sections contained the procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining income and resource eligibility for AFDC-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-cash assistance groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have removed and reserved &sect;435.113(b) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;436.111(b)(2). These paragraphs required States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide Medicaid to individuals denied AFDC because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involuntary inclusion of all eligible siblings living in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home as members of AFDC filing units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have removed and reserved &sect;435.600(b) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;436.600(b). These sections referred respectively to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;435.604 and &sect;436.604, which have been removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised &sect;435.601 and &sect;436.601 by removing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (e) in each section. These paragraphs contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for exceptions to financial application eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodologies and State plan requirements that are no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable. We also have corrected related cross-references 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in paragraph (b) and (f)(l) of each section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised &sect;435.602 by removing and reserving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (d) and &sect;436.602 by removing and reserving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c). These paragraphs contain requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining financial responsibility of relatives and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals for AFDC-related non-cash assistance groups. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also have corrected related cross-references in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;435.602(a), 436.602(a), and 436.602(a)(2).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The remainder of the January 1993 rule is unchanged and is effective on August 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifies that a regulation will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the RFA, we consider all Medicaid providers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as small entities. Individuals and States are not included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the definition of a small entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define a small rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 beds that is located outside a metropolitan statistical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule revises the January 19, 1993, final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule with comment period. We have decided to withdraw the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second part of that rule which basically codified a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory budgetary method for determining financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for AFDC-related non-cash assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals. We concluded, along with a number of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities, that this provision would result in significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative costs. The mandatory budget method has, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, been withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule will take effect on August 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the withdrawal of the referenced regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimizes any unnecessary burden on the public, and that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
best regulatory options have been selected. Further, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that these regulations will not lead to increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs. Therefore, we have determined that these provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will have a negligible cost effect and that a regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact analysis is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule will not result in a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant impact on the operations of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number of small rural hospitals. For these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons, we are not preparing analyses for either RFA or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1102(b) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule does not contain information collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements; therefore, it is not subject to Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget (OMB) review under the Paperwork 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12866, this final rule was reviewed by OMB.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Emergency Management Agency makes the final determinations listed below of the final determinations
of modified base (100-year) flood elevations for each community listed. These modified elevations have been published
in newspapers of local circulation and ninety (90) days have elapsed since that publication. The Associate Director
has resolved any appeals resulting from this notification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this notice. However, this rule
includes the address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base (100-year) flood elevation
determinations are available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modifications are made pursuant to Section 206 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and with 44 CFR Part 65.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP and are also used to
calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations are made
final, and for the contents in these buildings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes in base (100-year) flood elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4.

The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act because modified base (100-year) flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are required to maintain community eligibility in the NFIP. No regulatory
flexibility analysis has been prepared.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) By December 1, Scholars desiring Foundation support for graduate study the following academic year must submit
a proposed program of graduate study to the Foundation for approval. The graduate study program proposed for approval
may differ from that proposed by the Scholar when nominated for a Truman Scholarship. Factors to be used by the Foundation
in considering approval include being consistent with:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Field of study initially proposed in the Scholar's Nomination and Supporting Information Form;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Graduate school programs given priority in the current Bulletin of Information;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Undergraduate educational program and work experience of the Scholar; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Preparation specifically for a career in public service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Foundation approval in writing of the Scholar's proposal is required before financial support is granted for
graduate work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Scholars must include in their submission to the Foundation a statement of interest in a career in public service
that specifies in detail how their graduate program and their overall educational and work experience plans will
realistically prepare them for their chosen career goal in government or elsewhere in the public service. The Foundation
issues guidelines to help Scholars prepare their proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (d) After completing his or her undergraduate studies, a Scholar may request in writing each year a deferral of support
for graduate studies. Deferrals must be requested no later than June 15 for the succeeding academic year. Scholars
failing to request a year's deferral and to receive written approval from the Foundation will lose one year of funding
support for each year for which they fail to request and receive deferrals. Total deferrals may not exceed four years
unless an extension is approved by the Foundation. Extensions are generally granted only for Scholars attending
graduate or professional school and supported by other scholarships or private resources or for Scholars with commitments
to the uniformed services.

is eligible to receive up to $3000 for the senior year of undergraduate education. Scholars in graduate programs planning
to receive degrees in one to two years are eligible to receive up to $13,500 per year or $10,000 (adjusted annually from
January 1985 to reflect increases, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau
of Labor Statistics), whichever is less. Scholars in graduate programs requiring three or more years of academic
study are eligible to receive up to $9000 per year for a maximum of three years.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, on its own motion, reconsiders several aspects of the competitive bidding rules adopted for personal
communications services in the 2 GHz band (``broadband PCS''). The amendments adopted: exempt entities owned and
controlled by Indian tribes or Alaska Regional or Village Corporations organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act from the affiliation rules for purposes of eligibility to apply for licenses in frequency blocks C
and F (``entrepreneurs' blocks''); and modify the rules governing the attribution of gross revenues, total assets
and personal net worth of investors in corporate applicants in the entrepreneurs' blocks to permit non-attributable
investors to own up to 15 percent of a corporate applicant's voting stock. The Commission's action furthers the congressional
policies of ensuring that all classes of designated entities are provided opportunities for meaningful participation
in broadband PCS spectrum auctions. It also introduces additional flexibility into the attribution rules to attract
investment to all types of corporations controlled by entrepreneurs' block eligibles and to increase the level of
participation by smaller corporate applicants which have not made a public offering of their stock.

requirements are intended to prevent entities that, for all practical purposes, do not meet the Commission's size
standards from receiving benefits targeted to smaller entities. These safeguards ensure, pursuant to Section 309(j)(3)
of the Communications Act, that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 designated entities are provided with meaningful economic opportunities to participate in the provision of spectrum-based
services. Generally, affiliation arises when the applicant (or an attributable investor in the applicant) controls
or has power to control another entity or if the applicant (or an attributable investor in the applicant) is under the
control of the other entity. In developing its affiliation rules, the Commission borrowed from rules that are used
by SBA to make size determinations, including guidelines used to establish when a firm should be deemed an affiliate
of an applicant and other safeguards designed to ensure that only qualified entities are eligible for special benefits
under the SBA's ``section 8(a)'' program. The Commission failed, however, to adopt an exemption in the SBA's rules
that excluded from affiliation coverage entities owned and controlled by Indian tribes or Alaska Regional or Village
Corporations. See 13 CFR 121.401(b), 121.1102(a), 124.112(c). SBA is required by statute generally to determine
the size of a small business concern owned by an Indian tribe (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe) ``without
regard to its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of tribal government, or any other business enterprise owned
by the tribe.''
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The SBA has incorporated these and other statutory provisions into its regulations.

3. We have reexamined our eligibility and affiliation rules and will make an amendment to these rules that is more consistent
with the other Federal laws, policies and regulations so as not to preclude the eligibility of entities owned and controlled
by Indian tribes and Alaska Native Corporations for entrepreneurs' block licenses and for the benefits accorded
businesses owned by members of minority groups. We believe that adoption of an affiliation exemption for Indian tribes
and Alaska Native Corporations for purposes of eligibility in the entrepreneurs' blocks is consistent with these
other Federal policies
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and complies with the congressional mandate in the auction law.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, this exemption will ensure that the congressional policies of ensuring that minority-owned businesses
have the opportunity to participate in spectrum-based services will apply to a class of designated entities, Indian
tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, that Congress has determined to be economically disadvantaged. Without
the exemption we adopt herein, the Commission would not be able to ensure that all classes of designated entities are
provided meaningful opportunities to participate in broadband PCS spectrum auctions.

4. We note that Section 7(j)(10)(J) of the Small Business Act gives the SBA the discretion to consider tribal and other
affiliations if it determines that one or more such tribally owned businesses have obtained, or are likely to obtain,
a substantial unfair competitive advantage within an industry category.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 We do not believe it is necessary to make such a determination for broadband PCS auctions.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The limited potential number of broadband PCS applicants that may benefit from this affiliation exemption will not
present any unfair advantage to other eligible applicants that have had gross revenues up to $125 million and assets
of up to $500 million. In addition, this exemption from the affiliation rules applies only to applicants for entrepreneurs'
block licenses owned and controlled by Indian tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, not independent entities composed
of individual Native Americans or other entities composed of individual Native Americans or other entities owned
by members of this minority group. Thus, such entities will not have any unfair advantage over other minorities in
the entrepreneurs' blocks.

5. For purposes of determining eligibility to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, we also attribute to the applicant
(in addition to ``affiliates'' as discussed above) the gross revenues, assets and net worth of non-passive investors
in the applicant. The attribution and affiliation rules are designed to prevent ineligible parties from exerting
control or undue influence over firms eligible to apply for entrepreneurs' block licenses and to ensure that only

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 applicants receive broadband PCS licenses. At the same time, we recognized that passive investment in entrepreneurs'
block applicants would be critical to the successful development of these smaller companies. To balance these competing
considerations, we decided not to attribute investors in corporate applicants that own a 25 percent or less passive
equity interest. Passive equity in a corporate applicant was defined to include non-voting stock and no more than
5 percent of the voting stock. An exception was created, however for evaluating a publicly-traded corporation's
financial eligibility in the entrepreneurs' blocks: an investor's ownership of no more than 15 percent of the voting
stock in a publicly-traded corporate applicant would be considered passive equity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. We now believe that investors in all corporate applicants, including those that are not publicly traded, should
be able to include in their 25 percent passive equity investment up to 15 percent of the applicant's voting stock. Both
publicly traded and non-publicly traded applicants would have difficulty attracting substantial investment if
each individual investor could own no more than 5 percent of the voting stock. Investors that are prepared to devote
considerable funds to an entrepreneurs' block applicant should reasonably expect to exercise some ability to protect
their investment through a modest level of voting stock ownership. The 15 percent voting stock limit would, in this
respect, not rise to the level of a controlling interest, but, from the investor's perspective, could diminish the
substantial risks associated with committing funds to a PCS applicant and enhance the potential rewards for providing
start-up capital to these new ventures.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA is amending its Railroad Operating Rules and its Radio Standards and Procedures by removing requirements that
railroads file their operational testing programs, operating rules instruction programs, annual summaries on
operational tests and inspections, and their radio rules with the Federal Railroad Administrator and by substituting
requirements that railroads retain such records and make them available to FRA representatives during normal business
hours. FRA is also amending the Railroad Operating Rules by eliminating the requirement that Class III railroads
file their operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions with the Federal Railroad Administrator.
In addition, FRA is making technical changes to require railroads to record specific information when conducting
operational tests and inspections of their employees. Finally, FRA is changing the Railroad Operating Rules and
the Radio Standards and Procedures so as to allow retention of certain records by ``electronic recordkeeping'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, retention of a computer record in lieu of a paper record). These amendments are intended to eliminate nonessential
reporting requirements while enabling FRA to review meaningful data to determine the safety of a railroad's operations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 19, 1992, FRA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPRM'') on amendments to its Railroad Operating
Rules (49 CFR Part 217) and Radio Standards and Procedures (49 CFR Part 220). 57 FR 47603 (1992). FRA proposed to remove
requirements that railroads file their respective operating rules, radio rules, operational testing programs,
operating rules instruction programs, and annual summaries on operational tests and inspections with FRA in Washington,
D.C. and to substitute requirements that railroads retain these records and make them available upon request for
inspection by FRA personnel during regular business hours. FRA believed that these proposed amendments, if adopted,
would remove nonessential filing and reporting requirements while concurrently reducing the burden borne by the
railroads in paperwork and mailing expenses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA received written comments on the proposal from seven entities and conducted a public hearing at the request of
one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public hearing was held in Washington, DC, on December 14, 1992, at which four organizations were represented.
As a result of these comments and further analysis of the amendments proposed, FRA now publishes its final rule. FRA
recognizes the importance of a railroad's operating rules and its radio rules for moving trains and other pieces of
rolling equipment safely. The requirements promulgated in the final rule take this factor into account by balancing
FRA's interest in reviewing pertinent documents against the railroads' interest in reducing their paperwork burden.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule reflects reconsideration of the proposals announced in the NPRM. In the interest of reducing certain
paperwork requirements, FRA has adopted certain proposed revisions to the regulations. FRA has also authorized
railroads to retain information electronically so long as the railroads satisfy the stated conditions. Nevertheless,
FRA has retained the filing requirements prescribed in existing &sect;217.7 for Class I railroads and Class II railroads.

See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interstate Commerce Commission (``ICC'') regulations at 49 CFR Part 1201 and ICC General Instructions 1&hyph;1.
FRA has determined that its headquarters office, located in Washington, DC, needs to continue receiving copies of
the operating rules of national and regional railroads to remain apprised of such rules. Finally, FRA believes that
operational test and inspection records require more specific data elements. FRA has concluded that the newly identified
data points serve to clarify the existing information requirements by defining the individual sources comprising
each operational test and inspection.

Discussion of Comments and Conclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA received written comments from the American Public Transit Association, Association of American Railroads
(``AAR''), The American Short Line Railroad Association (``ASLRA''), Consolidated Rail Corporation (``Conrail''),
New Jersey Transit Rail Operations, Union Pacific Railroad Company, and United Transportation Union (``UTU'').
At the public hearing held December 14, 1992, four organizations participated: the Railway Labor Executives' Association
(``RLEA''), the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (``BLE''), AAR, and Conrail. The discussions that follow examine
the issues raised by the commenters and analyze the reasons behind the adoption of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whether FRA should abolish requirements that railroads file their operating rules, radio rules, and certain other
documents with FRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two unions representing railroad employees objected to the proposal that railroads merely retain their operating
rules, programs of operational tests and inspections, programs of instruction on operating rules, and annual summaries.
The UTU declared that FRA was abdicating its responsibility of reviewing the documents for regulatory compliance.
The UTU alleged that requiring the relocation of records to the railroad's system headquarters and division headquarters
would vest FRA's field inspectors with total enforcement responsibility and that, consequently, document inspection
would be entirely discretionary and no longer an integral part of FRA's safety assessment of a railroad. In other words,
the UTU claimed, FRA was sending a message that administering the operating rules regulations was no longer a priority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BLE echoed the UTU's concerns, stating that the removal of agency review at the headquarters level represented
a priority shift by FRA to no longer monitor a railroad's compliance with its operating rules or operational testing
and inspection program (i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, efficiency testing program). The purpose of these regulations was to afford FRA headquarters the opportunity to
analyze the data from the submitted documents. FRA needed to review incidents where railroad employees violated
their employers' operating rules to determine whether these violations compromised railroad safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AAR, however, fully endorsed FRA's proposals to eliminate filing. The AAR saw the filing of operating rules and
related documents as unnecessary, burdensome, and serving no safety objective. Furthermore, the AAR noted that
the railroad divisions comprising each railroad's system already provide the regulatory documents that FRA field
inspectors request for review. Requiring relocation of these records to offices that are visited by FRA field personnel
would facilitate document accessibility and retrieval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ASLRA also supported an end to the filing requirements. The ASLRA commented that these amendments would improve
efficiency and economy for the short line railroads and would promote review by inspectors familiar with a railroad's
operations. Three Class I railroads agreed that these measures would relieve burdensome requirements of photocopying
and mailing these documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although FRA proposed redesignating the locations of these records, FRA has reconsidered the impact this measure
would have on enforcement, accident investigation, and other functions. A railroad's operating rules and timetables
are valuable resources that are used by personnel of all disciplines in FRA's headquarters Office of Safety. For example,
at FRA headquarters, these documents are reviewed in conjunction with accident reports filed at headquarters under
49 CFR Part 225 by the railroad. The railroads' rules and timetables are also consulted during FRA headquarters' analysis
of draft accident investigation reports submitted by FRA field personnel. By maintaining a copy of the operating
rules and timetables of major railroads, FRA retains its ability to determine whether the operating rules themselves,
or violations of them, contributed to an accident. Retaining immediate access to these documents in Washington,
DC, provides FRA's headquarters office with an efficient means to identify unsafe or inadequate procedures and to
recommend practices that will ensure protection of train movements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA believes that ensuring safe train and other movements requires each Class I railroad, Class II railroad, the National
Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), and each railroad providing commuter service in a metropolitan or suburban
area to continue filing its operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions with FRA. These railroads
conduct extensive operations, all of which are governed by their operating rules. FRA's interest in reviewing these
documents outweighs the burdens imposed on the railroads to continue filing these records. Therefore, FRA retains
the existing filing requirements for these railroads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that the rules FRA is reviewing are current, each railroad subject to this requirement must submit
its operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions to FRA by December 21, 1994, and must submit
each subsequent amendment to these operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions issued after
November 21, 1994, to FRA within 30 days after it is issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, FRA believes that the regulations on the operational testing programs, operating rules instruction
programs, operational test and inspection records (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
efficiency tests), and radio rules can be effectively enforced from the field. These records are better utilized
by FRA's regional personnel to monitor a railroad's compliance with the regulatory requirements. The field staff
are best situated to observe a railroad's operations and determine whether the operational testing programs, operating
rules instruction programs, operational test and inspections records, and radio rules are accurate and current.
Additionally, the field inspectors can examine the operational test and inspection results in evaluating an employee's
performance of his or her duties in accordance with a railroad's rules and instructions. FRA therefore adopts the
proposal requiring railroads to retain their programs of operational tests and inspections, programs of instruction
on railroad operating rules, records of operational tests and inspections (including annual summaries on operational
tests and inspections), and radio rules at the designated locations provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whether the three-year record retention requirements proposed in the NPRM for operational testing programs and
annual summaries of operational tests and inspections will enhance railroad safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM proposed requiring railroads to retain their operational testing programs under &sect;217.9 and annual
summaries of operational tests and inspections under &sect;217.13(a)&hyph;(c) for three calendar years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA received comments supporting and opposing this proposal. The California Legislative Board of the UTU advocated
record retention, but argued that this information should be retained for a minimum of five years. The BLE recommended
that operational tests and inspections be retained for only six months to one year. Both the UTU and BLE stated that
record retention would enable FRA to accurately assess a railroad's history of safe operations by examining this
collected data. The unions believed that FRA could gain a wider perspective on a railroad's results of its operational
tests and inspections and thereby target potential hazards in operating rules application, understanding, and
compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The railroads generally disagreed with the unions. One railroad urged FRA to modify its proposed retention requirement
from three years to one year. Likewise, the AAR and ASLRA concurred with this recommendation. Specifically, the ASLRA
claimed that the proposed three-year record retention requirement was superfluous given the recordkeeping requirements
already imposed on railroads under the Locomotive Engineer Qualification and Certification regulations (49 CFR
Part 240). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA disputes the ASLRA's judgment that these proposed requirements are duplicative. Part 240 addresses only locomotive
engineers (persons who operate locomotives), but to ensure the safe movement of railroad equipment, railroads also
routinely test conductors, operators, dispatchers, and maintenance-of-way personnel. All of these employees
are, at one time or another, placed in situations or conditions that require knowledge and execution of a railroad's
operating rules. Therefore, FRA believes that maximizing safety requires each railroad to retain its program of
operational tests and inspections for all employees covered by its operating rules.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA has concluded that a thorough analysis of a railroad's operating procedures requires adopting the proposal as
stated. Accordingly, all railroads must retain their operational testing programs and annual summaries on operational
tests and inspections for three calendar years. FRA believes that trend analysis of this data will serve as an effective
tool to assess a railroad's regulatory compliance. Inspectors can better recognize patterns of rules noncompliance
and efforts railroads have made to remedy safety problems uncovered by previous tests. The results of these tests
may be used as a barometer to measure the safety of a railroad and determine whether its level of compliance is improving,
deteriorating, or remaining steady. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Whether FRA's proposal requiring railroads to retain their operating rules, radio rules, operational testing
programs, operating rules instruction programs, and annual summaries on operational tests and inspections at the
system headquarters and all division headquarters is overly burdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule identified two locations where railroads were required to retain pertinent rules and programs:
division headquarters and system headquarters. The NPRM proposed that railroads would retain their operating rules
and Radio Standards and Procedures paperwork at all of their division headquarters and at the system headquarters.
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
proposed &sect;&sect;217.7&hyph;217.13 (introductory text). FRA believed that most railroads already maintained
copies of these records at these locations and that, therefore, FRA's enforcement personnel would be able to effectively
and efficiently enforce Parts 217 and 220 by visiting any one of these sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal prompted a number of parties to comment on its usefulness. Four commenters argued that requiring the
railroads to retain the pertinent documents at their system headquarters and at all of their division headquarters
would impose additional administrative costs with no offsetting safety benefits. Two organizations suggested
that the operational testing programs and annual summaries be retained only at the railroad's system headquarters.
Another two parties recommended that each railroad's division headquarters retain only information that applies
to operations within that geographical division. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA agrees with the commenters that the proposal was overbroad in scope. The final rule departs from the NPRM by requiring
that each division headquarters retain only those documents that the division applies and enforces (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
operational testing programs and operating rules instruction programs). Likewise, each division headquarters
must retain the records of operational tests and inspections conducted by that division. The proposal that each railroad
retain its operational testing program, operating rules instruction program, and annual summaries on operational
tests and inspections (for railroads with 400,000 or more total manhours) at the system headquarters has been adopted
unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA assumes that railroads with extensive operations conduct operational tests and inspections at all division
headquarters. Railroad safety requires that all employees responsible for train operations comply with a railroad's
operating rules governing train movements over a territory. Therefore, under final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;217.9(d), railroads with 400,000 or more total manhours will be required to retain their annual summaries
on operational tests and inspections records at their system headquarters and at each of their division headquarters.
Although two parties asked that the regulation be amended to require railroads to retain all of their annual summaries
only at the system headquarters level, FRA believes that this data must also be available at all division headquarters
in order for inspectors to determine the extent of rules compliance in other divisions and system-wide. This requirement
will not impose any further burdens on the railroads because, as one commenter noted, the railroads already maintain
copies of these documents at the division level and provide copies for FRA inspectors upon request. FRA believes that
effective inspections of annual summaries are best served by examining these records at a railroad's division headquarters
and system headquarters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whether FRA should permit electronic retention of documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM never addressed this issue specifically. However, the proposal's emphasis on deregulation encouraged
several parties to recommend that FRA allow railroads to retain records and reports by electronic recordkeeping.
Both the written and oral comments stressed the cost savings that computer filing would provide to railroads. Requiring
railroads to retain the information in paper form would impose additional administrative and storage costs. Computer
storage of these documents would also enable the railroads to immediately update any amendments to their operational
testing programs and operating rules instruction programs. Moreover, one commenter argued that retaining ``hard
copies'' that contained historical data could create confusion in the offices that utilize the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the written comments and the transcript of the public hearing, FRA agrees with the commenters that
electronic retention is a practical alternative for railroads to comply with the regulatory recordkeeping requirements.
FRA thus authorizes railroads to retain their operational testing programs, operational test and inspection records
(including annual summaries), and instruction programs on operating rules by electronic recordkeeping provided
that certain conditions are met to safeguard the data entered and stored in a computer system. These stipulations
are stated in &sect;217.9(e) and explained in the Section-by-Section Analysis. Railroads that elect to use electronic
data processing systems to store their operating rules information must be certain that proper security measures
are implemented to ensure the integrity of the documents retrieved for inspection. Moreover, the information produced
by computer must be organized in a usable format to afford FRA inspectors complete access to the records. FRA believes
that electronic record retention is a viable option for the railroads provided that FRA's monitoring activities
to measure compliance remain unimpeded.

the public hearing, and further review and reflection within FRA. Where terms or paragraphs in the final rule differ

Section 217.7 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contains the filing and recordkeeping requirements with regard to operating rules, timetables, and timetable special
instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) provides that Class I railroads, Class II railroads, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation
(Amtrak), and railroads providing commuter service in a metropolitan or suburban area must continue to file their
operating rules, timetables, and timetable special instructions with the Federal Railroad Administrator. The
deadline for filing these documents is November 21, 1994. Most railroads are in compliance with FRA's existing provisions
concerning such filings. For such railroads, it is not FRA's intent that another copy of already filed material be
given to the agency. If a railroad currently has its documents on file with the agency, FRA will deem that railroad to
be in compliance with this section, if the documents are in effect on November 21, 1994. (In other words, if previously
filed documents are still in effect on November 21, 1994, then a railroad has complied with the new provision, having
filed before December 21, 1994.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) provides that railroads subject to the filing requirements must also submit to FRA a copy of any amendment
to these documents issued after November 21, 1994, within 30 days after it is issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under paragraph (c), Class III railroads and all other railroads subject to this part but not subject to paragraphs
(a) and (b) of this section must retain one copy of their current operating rules, timetables, and timetable special
instructions at their respective system headquarters. These documents must be made available to FRA representatives
for inspection and photocopying during normal business hours.

Program of operational tests and inspections; recordkeeping; annual summary on operational tests and inspections;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed amendments to &sect;217.9 called for railroads to retain one copy of their operational test and inspection
programs at all division headquarters and at the system headquarters. The final rule adopts this proposal with some
significant modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a) is adopted unchanged, with one exception: A railroad must now conduct its operational tests
and inspections in accordance with a program that it retains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) also departs from the proposed text. After November 21, 1994, a railroad must retain one copy of its current
program of operational tests and inspections. The program must be updated with any subsequent amendments. These
programs must be retained at the system headquarters of the railroad and at the division headquarters for each division
where the tests prescribed in the program are conducted (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the records availability may be division specific). In other words, if certain tests are not conducted in a certain
division, that division headquarters need not retain a copy of the program prescribing those particular tests. The
operational testing program must be made available to FRA representatives for inspection and photocopying during
normal business hours and must be retained for three calendar years following the end of the year to which it relates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria requirements stated in existing &sect;217.9(b) (1)&hyph;(4) and (6) remain unchanged, and a conforming
change is made to paragraph (b)(5): deletion of the reference to a program ``filed with'' FRA. Under final rule paragraph
(b)(5), a railroad must begin conducting operational tests and inspections within 30 days after November 21, 1994
or the date of commencing operations, whichever is later. This requirement will not affect railroads that are currently
in operation, given that the existing regulations already require railroads to begin their programs within 30 days
after they file their operational testing programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Redesignated &sect;217.9(c) (formerly &sect;217.9(d)) requires a railroad to keep a record of the date, time, place,
and result of each operational test and inspection that was performed in accordance with its program. Each record
must identify the officer administering the operational test and inspection and each employee tested. These requirements
clarify the information requirements provided under existing &sect;217.9(d) by identifying specific data points
each record must provide. These revisions will promote the examination of relevant information from captured data
sources, enabling FRA to determine the effectiveness of a railroad's operational testing program. The operational
test and inspection records must be retained for one calendar year after the end of the year to which they relate at the
system headquarters of the railroad and at the division headquarters for each division where the tests are conducted
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the records availability may be division specific). Additionally, railroads must make their operational test and
inspection records available to FRA representatives for inspection and photocopying during normal business hours.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA has decided to organize all provisions in Part 217 pertaining to operational tests and inspections under &sect;217.9;
therefore, &sect;217.13 introductory text and paragraphs (a) through (c) are removed and redesignated as &sect;217.9(d).
New paragraph (d) requires railroads with 400,000 or more total manhours per year to compile an ``annual summary''
recounting the number, type, and result of each operational test and inspection conducted, stated according to operating
divisions where applicable, which are the same requirements as provided under existing &sect;217.13(b). The summaries
should be indexed in a well organized format to facilitate efficient and manageable review. FRA has also concluded
that annual compilations of the total number of train miles and of the rate at which the railroad conducts operational
tests and inspections provide limited useful information; therefore, these existing requirements are removed
from the final rule. These compilations, redesignated ``annual summaries on operational tests and inspections,''
must be made available at each division headquarters and at the system headquarters by March 1 of each calendar year.
Such annual summaries are required to be retained at these locations for three calendar years after the end of the year
to which they relate and made available to FRA representatives for inspection and photocopying during normal business
hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New &sect;217.9(e) authorizes railroads to retain their operational testing programs, operational test and inspection
records, and annual summaries on operational tests and inspections by electronic recordkeeping, subject to conditions
stated in that provision. This provision provides an alternative for railroads retaining certain information as
required in the regulations.

Each participating railroad must have the essential components of a computer system (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a desk-top computer and either a facsimile machine or a printer connected to the computer to retrieve and produce
records for immediate review). The material retrieved in hard copy form must contain relevant information organized
in a usable format to render the data completely understandable. The documents must be made available for FRA inspection
during normal business hours, which FRA interprets as the time, any day of the week, when railroads conduct their regular
business transactions. Nevertheless, FRA reserves the right to review and examine the documents prepared in accordance
with the Railroad Operating Rules and Radio Standards and Procedures regulations at any reasonable time if situations
warrant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, each railroad must provide adequate security measures to limit employee access to its electronic
data processing system and must prescribe who can create, modify, or delete data from the data base. Although FRA does
not identify the management position capable of instituting changes in the data base, each railroad must indicate
the source authorized to make such changes. Each railroad must also designate who will be authorized to authenticate
the hard copies produced from the electronic format. In short, each railroad electing to electronically retain its
records must ensure the integrity of the information and prevent possible tampering of data, enabling FRA to fully
execute its enforcement responsibilities.

Program of instruction on operating rules; recordkeeping; electronic recordkeeping. Section 217.11 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

is revised to require that a railroad retain a copy of its instruction program on operating rules instead of filing
a copy with the Federal Railroad Administrator. Paragraph (a), which mandates periodic instruction of employees
whose activities are governed by the railroad's operating rules in accordance with a written program, remains unchanged,
with the exception that the system headquarters of the railroad is to retain a copy of the entire instruction program
and that the division headquarters for each division where an employee is instructed is to retain all portions of the
copy of the program that the division applies and enforces. (In other words, the records availability at the division
headquarters may be division specific.) Paragraph (b) mandates that after November 21, 1994, or 30 days before commencing
operations, whichever is later, a railroad must make one copy of its current program and one copy of any subsequent
revision available to FRA for inspection and photocopying during normal business hours. Paragraph (c) is added to
authorize a railroad to retain by electronic recordkeeping its instruction program on operating rules, provided
that certain conditions specified in &sect;217.9(e) (1)&hyph;(5) are met.

as &sect;217.9(d), &sect;217.13 is removed and existing &sect;217.15, ``Information collection requirements,''

provided under existing &sect;217.15(b)(4), redesignated &sect;217.13(b)(4), which is, therefore, removed.

provides that Class I railroads, Class II railroads, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and railroads
providing commuter service in a metropolitan or suburban area must retain their radio rules at all division headquarters
and at the system headquarters. Under subparagraph (2), Class III railroads and all other railroads subject to this
part but not subject to subparagraph (1) are required to retain their radio rules at their respective system headquarters.
These records are required to be made available to FRA representatives for inspection and photocopying during normal
business hours.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been evaluated in accordance with existing regulatory policies. The regulatory document is considered
to be a nonsignificant regulatory action under E.O. 12866 and is a nonsignificant rule under &sect;5(a)(4) of DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures [44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979] because it eliminates nonessential reporting
requirements while maintaining a high level of safety. FRA has prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket a regulatory
evaluation addressing the economic impact of this rule. A copy of the regulatory evaluation may be reviewed and copied
in Room 8201, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its regulatory analysis, FRA found that railroads will derive several benefits with the implementation of this
rule. First, the final rule eliminates or narrows the applicability of various requirements that railroads reproduce
and mail to FRA certain records and reports of operating rules and practices, thereby reducing administrative and
postage expenses. Although certain railroads will still have to submit particular documents to FRA, the final rule
removes most processing and handling expenditures associated with filing the paperwork requirements under existing
Part 217. Second, the final rule reduces Federal government labor costs necessary to examine, organize, and compile
the information since most of the records will be retained at the appropriate railroad offices. Finally, railroads
will be permitted to retain required information in an electronic format, thereby reducing storage and overhead
costs and facilitating access to selected records. The regulatory evaluation does not quantify the reduction in
costs available to railroads electing to exercise this option; therefore, this analysis does not reflect the economic
benefits gained from electronic recordkeeping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA estimates that, over a twenty-year period, this rule will cost the railroad industry a total of $786. The cost to
the railroads to comply with this rule is about $311 for the first year and $25 for every year thereafter. This cost burden
is attributed to the changes in recordkeeping requirements provided in the rule. The total benefits of this rule over
a twenty-year period amount to about $449,628 for reduced labor, copying, and postage costs in both the railroad industry
and government sector. In the first year, the savings are estimated to be $22,432 and $22,484 for each subsequent year.
The benefits will be about 447.52 times the costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires a review of rules to assess their impact on small entities. In reviewing the economic impact of the rule,
FRA concluded that it will not have any measurable impact on small entities. There are no direct or indirect economic
impacts for small units of government, businesses, or other organizations. Therefore, it is certified that this
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the provisions of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule establishing that any over-the-counter (OTC) drug
product for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps is not generally recognized as safe and
effective and is misbranded. FDA is issuing this final rule after considering public comments on the agency's proposed
regulation, which was issued in the form of a tentative final monograph, and all new data and information on drug products
for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps that have come to the agency's attention. This
final rule is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA.

 of October 1, 1982 (47 FR 43562), FDA published, under &sect;330.10(a)(6) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(6)), an advance notice
of proposed rulemaking to reopen the rulemaking for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug
products to consider the OTC use of quinine for the treatment of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, together with the recommendations
of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Miscellaneous Internal Drug Products (Miscellaneous Internal Panel), which
was the advisory review panel responsible for evaluating data on the active ingredients in this drug class. Interested
persons were invited to submit comments by December 30, 1982. Reply comments in response to comments filed in the initial
comment period could be submitted by January 31, 1983.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;330.10(a)(10), the data and information considered by the Panel were put on display in the
Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville,
MD 20857, after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's proposed regulation, in the form of a tentative final monograph, for OTC drug products for the treatment
and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 8, 1985 (50 FR 46588). Interested persons were invited to file by January 7, 1986, written comments, objections,
or requests for oral hearing before the Commissioner of Food and Drugs regarding the proposal. Interested persons
were invited to file comments on the agency's economic impact determination by March 10, 1986. New data could have
been submitted until November 10, 1986, and comments on the new data could have been submitted until January 8, 1987.
Final agency action occurs with the publication of this final rule on OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble to the agency's proposed rule on OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal
leg muscle cramps (50 FR 46588), the agency stated that no active ingredient in drug products used OTC for the treatment
and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps had been found to be generally recognized as safe and effective and
not misbranded, but that Category I labeling was being proposed in that document in the event that data were submitted
that resulted in the upgrading of any ingredients to monograph status in the final rule. In this final rule, no ingredient
in OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps has been determined to be generally
recognized as safe and effective. Therefore, proposed part 343 (21 CFR 343), subpart E for OTC drug products for the
treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps is not being issued as a final regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule declares OTC drug products containing active ingredients for the treatment and/or prevention of
nocturnal leg muscle cramps to be new drugs under section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act)
(21 U.S.C. 321(p)), for which an application or abbreviated application (hereinafter called application) approved
under section 505 of the act (21 U.S.C. 355) and 21 CFR part 314 is required for marketing. In the absence of an approved
application, products containing drugs for this use also would be misbranded under section 502 of the act (21 U.S.C.
352). In appropriate circumstances, a citizen petition to establish a monograph may be submitted under 21 CFR 10.30
in lieu of an application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule amends 21 CFR part 310 to include drug products containing active ingredients for the treatment and/or
prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps by adding new &sect;310.546 (21 CFR 310.546) to subpart E. The inclusion
of OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps in part 310 is consistent with
FDA's established policy for regulations in which there are no monograph conditions. (See, e.g., &sect;&sect;310.510,
310.519, 310.525, 310.526, 310.532, 310.533, and 310.534.) If, in the future, any ingredient is determined to be
generally recognized as safe and effective for use in an OTC drug product for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal
leg muscle cramps, the agency will promulgate an appropriate regulation at that time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTC drug procedural regulations (21 CFR 330.10) provide that any testing necessary to resolve the safety or effectiveness
issues that formerly resulted in a Category III classification, and submission to FDA of the results of that testing
or any other data, must be done during the OTC drug rulemaking process before the establishment of a final monograph.
Accordingly, FDA does not use the terms ``Category I'' (generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded),
``Category II'' (not generally recognized as safe and effective or misbranded), and ``Category III'' (available
data are insufficient to classify as safe and effective, and further testing is required) at the final monograph stage.
In place of Category I, the term ``monograph conditions'' is used; in place of Categories II or III, the term ``nonmonograph
conditions'' is used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule for OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps (50 FR
46588), the agency advised that it would provide a period of 12 months after the date of publication of the final monograph
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for relabeling and reformulation of drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps
to be in compliance with the monograph. Although several manufacturers submitted data and information in response
to the proposed rule, the data and information were not sufficient to support monograph conditions, and no monograph
is being established at this time. Therefore, drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg
muscle cramps that are subject to this rule are not generally recognized as safe and effective and are misbranded (nonmonograph
conditions). The agency also stated that if a safety problem is identified for a particular nonmonograph condition,
a shorter deadline may be set for removal of that condition from OTC drug products. As stated below, a safety problem
has been identified for OTC drug products containing quinine sulfate for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal
leg muscle cramps. Therefore, the agency has determined that initial introduction or initial delivery for introduction
into interstate commerce of quinine sulfate for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps must
cease effective February 22, 1995. After that date, no OTC drug products that are subject to this final rule may be initially
introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless they are the subject of an approved
application. The agency is unaware of any quinine sulfate drug product for this indication that is the subject of an
approved application. Any such drug product in interstate commerce after the effective date of this final rule that
is not in compliance with the regulation is subject to regulatory action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the proposed rule on OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps,
three drug manufacturers and a nutrition information service submitted comments. One comment included a request
for an oral hearing before the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the administrative record closed, a citizen petition was submitted on December 1, 1988. In response to this
petition, nine additional comments were submitted. The Commissioner found that the petition and subsequent comments
raised safety and effectiveness issues that warranted consideration before the final rule issued. Accordingly,
under &sect;330.10(a)(7)(v), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commissioner determined that good cause was shown to warrant consideration of the petition and the additional comments
before the final rule issued. Copies of the comments received and the petition are on public display in the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Additional information that has come to the agency's attention since publication
of the proposed rule is also on public display in the Dockets Management Branch.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. One comment disagreed with the agency's determination that adequate clinical data did not exist to support the
Category I status of quinine for both safety and effectiveness for OTC use in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal
leg muscle cramps (50 FR 46588 at 46590). The comment expressed the belief that sufficient evidence already exists
for this use of quinine. In support of its position, the comment referred to information it had submitted on December
27, 1982, in response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for this class of drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency discussed this information in the tentative final monograph (50 FR 46588 at 46589) and concluded that it
did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that quinine is generally recognized as safe and effective for OTC
use for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. The agency identified the issues to be addressed
in studies before quinine could be reclassified from Category III to Category I (50 FR 46590 and 46591). The comment
did not provide any new information to address these issues. New data and information submitted by other interested
persons are discussed in section I.B., comments 4 through 9 of this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Comments on the Safety of Nocturnal Leg Muscle Cramp Ingredients
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Two comments contended that FDA accepted the safe OTC use of quinine sulfate for nocturnal leg cramps when it published,
and did not dissent from, the Miscellaneous Internal Panel's conclusions and recommendations that ``* * * quinine
appears to be reasonably safe over prolonged periods of time in generally recommended doses of 200 to 325 mg daily''
(47 FR 43562 at 43564).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the comments' contention, the record makes it clear that neither the agency nor the advisory panels accepted
the safety of OTC use of quinine for nocturnal leg muscle cramps. The July 8, 1977 report of the Advisory Review Panel
on OTC Internal Analgesic and Antirheumatic Drug Products (42 FR 35346 at 35434) summarized the safety of quinine
and stated ``Although quinine has demonstrated analgesic, antipyretic and muscle relaxant actions, its numerous
toxic effects give it an unfavorable benefit to risk ratio for these purposes.'' The Panel concluded that ``Until
controlled studies show that a dose of not more than 325 mg daily is safe and useful for relief of nocturnal leg cramps
the drug should not be available for OTC use for treatment of nocturnal leg cramps.'' While the Miscellaneous Internal
Panel's report stated that quinine ``* * * appears to be reasonably safe * * *'' (47 FR 43564), the Panel did not conclude
that quinine was safe in doses used for the treatment of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. The Panel's recommendation that
quinine should be placed in Category III for use in the treatment of nocturnal leg muscle cramps cited the need for more
information about both safety and efficacy in its concluding statement (47 FR 43564). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the tentative final monograph for OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle
cramps, the agency concurred with: (1) The Miscellaneous Internal Panel's classification of quinine sulfate as
Category III, and (2) the Internal Analgesic Panel's conclusion that the drug should not be generally recognized
as safe and effective (Category II) for this use until its safety and efficacy are demonstrated in controlled clinical
trials (50 FR 46588 at 46592). It is clear, therefore, that neither the agency nor its advisory panels have determined
that quinine may be safely used for this indication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Three comments stated that quinine has been safely used by millions of consumers for a variety of conditions, including
leg cramps, for more than 50 years, and that this long history of usage demonstrates the safety of quinine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General reference to the history of use of quinine cannot be accepted as evidence of its safety. Historically, there
has been no clear location for the organized collection and analysis of adverse drug experience reports on OTC drug
products. Adverse events associated with OTC drug products are still vastly underreported for a number of reasons.
First, for most OTC drugs there is no requirement that manufacturers and distributors report adverse events to the
FDA, even those that are serious or life threatening. Second, physicians, who are the principal reporters to the United
States spontaneous reporting system, may not become aware of reactions to OTC drugs. Patients often do not mention
OTC drugs in giving medication histories. If they do, it is often not clear to physicians to which manufacturer the
adverse event should be reported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Two comments in support of keeping quinine available OTC discussed the adverse event reports on file for quinine
in FDA's spontaneous reporting system. Lavy (Ref. 1) stated that there were 52 reports suggestive of hypersensitivity
reactions, including 8 deaths, among the reports on file from 1969 to 1988. Lavy concentrated on reports of thrombocytopenia
(a decrease in the number of blood platelets) and stated that bleeding secondary to thrombocytopenia may have been
related to four of the eight deaths reported in this 20-year period. The comment stated that only one case provided
sufficient information to fulfill all diagnostic criteria for drug-induced immunologic thrombocytopenia (consistent
clinical history, exclusion of other causes, positive in vitro test and, theoretically, the demonstration of recurrent
thrombocytopenia after rechallenge). Lavy pointed out that adverse event reports should reflect a significant
prevalence of severe quinine-associated purpura (if occurring) because this reaction is readily identifiable
by the patient, physician, and hospital. Using industry quinine sales figures and data from the FDA spontaneous reporting
system, Lavy concluded that the number of reported quinine-related hypersensitivity reactions is quite low, even
if greatly underreported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aster (Ref. 2) reviewed adverse drug reactions reported to FDA from 1969 through December 1989 and estimated that
approximately 1,000 reactions in 313 individuals were reported for quinine. Aster's estimate was not limited to
hypersensitivity reactions, but included all reported reactions (including multiple reactions per individual).
Aster did not report the specific search criteria used to obtain the adverse drug reaction reports other than to state
that the ``FDA materials provide a cumulative listing of all adverse drug reactions (ADR) reported in connection
with quinine since 1969.'' After eliminating reactions considered highly unlikely to bear a cause-and-effect relationship
to quinine, Aster identified 254 reactions that he considered ``significant.'' There were 83 hematologic reactions
and 46 additional reactions possibly associated with hypersensitivity. Of 63 possible cases of thrombocytopenia,
36 included information verifying low platelet levels. Aster identified 50 fatalities (15 from hematologic complications,
3 from hypersensitivity, and 32 from other causes). Overall, Aster classified 51 percent of the adverse reactions
as idiosyncratic and eight percent as the result of overdose. The remaining 41 percent were of indeterminate etiology
and consisted of liver and kidney dysfunction, neurologic disorders, and various hemorrhagic manifestations.
Of the reports in which inadequate information was provided for full evaluation, Aster noted the possibility that
some of the six cerebrovascular accidents reported may have been associated with thrombocytopenia induced by quinine.
Aster concluded that: (1) No information is available that would enable the identification of people at risk to sensitivity
reactions to quinine; (2) the rarity of sensitivity reactions and the rapidity with which they occur make early detection
of such reactions impossible and, (3) the dramatic symptomatology of such reactions, when they occur, leads people
to seek prompt medical attention. Aster concluded, therefore, that serious adverse reactions would neither be prevented
nor reduced in incidence by restricting quinine availability to prescription status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the comments and the reports of adverse reactions to quinine products (listed in the agency's
spontaneous reporting system under quinine, quinine sulfate, and three brand name products used for the treatment
and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps). From 1969 through June 1992, FDA received 157 adverse reaction
reports in which quinine was listed as a suspect drug. There were 84 serious reactions: 23 deaths, 5 cases in which the
person was disabled, and 56 hospitalizations not involving death or disablement. Of the 157 adverse reaction reports,
52 (approximately 33 percent) did not contain dosage and/or product name information, or reported daily dosages
in excess of those typically recommended for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. The
remaining 105 reports listed the names of quinine products labeled for use in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal
leg muscle cramps and/or daily dosages recommended by these products, and included 60 serious reactions involving
16 deaths, 4 cases of disablement, and 40 hospitalizations not involving death or disablement. More importantly,
56 of the 105 reports (approximately 53 percent) have been received since 1988, and there is an alarming trend of increasing
numbers of reports per year since 1986 as the market for OTC drug products containing quinine for the treatment and/or
prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps has expanded during that period. Approximately 70 percent (42 of 60) of
all reports of serious reactions, 44 percent (7 of 16) of all reported deaths, and 78 percent (31 of 40) of all reported
hospitalizations on file since 1969 were reported in the 4 1/2-year period between January 1988 and July 1992. There
were 20 cases (19 percent of reports on file) reported in 1991 alone: 3 were disabling, 11 required hospitalization,
and 1 resulted in death.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nocturnal leg muscle cramps are a common condition in the elderly (Ref. 3). Presumably, with an increasing average
age in the American population, the market for OTC drug products containing quinine for the treatment and/or prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps also increased during this period. The number of adverse reaction reports for people
60 years of age or older, involving quinine products and/or quinine dosages used in the treatment and/or prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, has increased by a factor of five (from 2 to 10) during the period between January 1988
and December 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency conducted a detailed review of 110 reports on file from 1969 through 1990; 69 (approximately 63 percent)
of these reports involved hypersensitivity reactions ranging from rash and fever to angioneurotic edema, thrombocytopenia,
or generalized anaphylaxis. Of these 69 reports, 57 (approximately 83 percent) involved quinine products and/or
quinine dosages used in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. An attempt was made to identify
only those reports in which the relationship between quinine and the reported event was strong and reasonably unrelated
to other factors. Factors considered included the temporal relationship between quinine administration and the
event, absence of concomitant medications (or abatement of the adverse event after quinine was discontinued), absence
of confounding medical conditions, a positive test for quinine mediated antibodies, or history of a similar reaction
associated with previous quinine exposure. Using these factors, of the 110 reports 26 were identified in which it
can be reasonably concluded that quinine was the causative agent. These included 6 moderately severe to severe skin
reactions, 2 of which were erythema multiforme-like reactions; 13 hematologic events, with 2 resulting in death;
2 cases of hepatitis or elevated liver enzymes; 2 renal reactions, one leading to renal failure requiring dialysis,
the other leading to death; 2 cases of a hypersensitivity syndrome with symptoms that included chills, nausea, vomiting,
and diarrhea; and 1 report of anaphylaxis complicated by seizures and hypoxia following a single dose of quinine.
None of these cases reported an overdose of the drug, and 21 of the 26 reports (approximately 81 percent) involved quinine
products and/or quinine dosages used in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even using strict criteria to identify cases in which a causal relationship of quinine to adverse event is likely,
FDA finds that quinine is associated with serious adverse events. There is no compelling reason to restrict evaluation
of the safety of quinine to reported cases of thrombocytopenia, as Lavy did. The other adverse effects are also serious
and must be considered in weighing the benefits and risks of products containing quinine. The agency agrees with Aster
that there is currently no way in advance to identify people at risk of hypersensitivity reactions and, therefore,
no effective way to warn against use by such individuals (see section I.B., comment 10). It does not agree, however,
that physician monitoring might not minimize serious reactions. Thrombocytopenia, for example, can lead to bruising
and other evidence of cutaneous bleeding. A physician could warn patients to report such signs and stop the drug, perhaps
preventing a significant hemorrhagic event.

5. Several comments contended that the true incidence of quinine-induced thrombocytopenia is many times smaller
than that suggested by estimates based on events reported from exposure to quinine-containing drug products alone.
The comments contended that such estimates fail to account for the much larger exposure to quinine through beverages.
Lavy estimated exposure to quinine in beverages to be about 10 times greater than exposure to quinine in drug products
(Ref. 1). An agency search of the medical literature identified only 10 cases of hypersensitivity reactions attributed
to quinine in beverages (Refs. 2 through 9). One of these reactions occurred following ingestion of a drug product
containing quinine by a person presumed to have been previously sensitized by exposure to beverages (Ref. 5). None
of these events was fatal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency finds that the available information supports the safe use of quinine in beverages such as tonic water and
bitter lemon. Given the level of consumption of quinine beverages, there is a scarcity of reported hypersensitivity
reactions, even assuming that reactions to food products are vastly underreported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite these safety data from beverage use, the agency does not consider pooling total consumption and adverse reaction
data on quinine from food and drug products to be a legitimate basis to judge the safety of drug products containing
quinine. First, there are differences in the quinine exposure levels because quinine is present in much greater amounts
in drug products. Second, there is a great disparity in the incidence of reports of hypersensitivity reactions to
beverage and drug products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency considers the appropriate basis on which to estimate the incidence of hypersensitivity to quinine-containing
drug products in leg cramp sufferers is to evaluate reports of reactions in the people who take such products at the
dose, frequency, and for the duration recommended in product labeling. Adjusting the reported incidence of reactions
to drug products by pooling data on beverages erroneously exaggerates the risk of reaction to quinine in beverages,
vastly underestimates the risk of reaction to quinine-containing drug products, and contradicts the raw data on
these products. Both the number and the severity of reported hypersensitivity reactions to drug products containing
quinine raise safety concerns about these products (see section I.B., comment 4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency considers the virtual absence of reports of reactions to beverages containing small amounts of quinine
(i.e., not more than 83 parts per million) as support for the safety of such use. Thus, the use of quinine salts in food
in accord with conditions described in 21 CFR 172.575 is not affected by this final rule on drug products for the treatment
and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.

6. Four comments submitted five reports (Refs. 1 through 5) of controlled clinical studies of quinine alone or in combination
with vitamin E. The agency has reviewed these studies for evidence pertaining to the safety of quinine used to treat
and/or prevent nocturnal leg muscle cramps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first study (Ref. 1) was a 10-week, crossover study of 69 subjects randomized to either 260 milligrams (mg) quinine
sulfate or placebo. Subjects were 26 to 77 years of age, with a mean age of 51. Five adverse reactions to quinine (a 7 percent
incidence) were reported. One subject was unable to tolerate the quinine because tinnitus (ringing in the ears) in
both ears occurred while taking the study drug. Two additional subjects experienced tinnitus while taking quinine,
but continued the medication and completed the study (although the protocol called for discontinuation of the study
drug if ringing in the ears occurred). One additional subject experienced disorientation and another reported dizziness
while taking quinine. No adverse events to placebo were reported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second study (Ref. 2) was a 10-week, double-blind, randomized, crossover study of 62 subjects receiving daily
doses of either 325 mg quinine sulfate or placebo. Subjects were 21 to 76 years of age, with a mean age of 47. Three subjects
on quinine and three subjects on placebo reported adverse events. The quinine reactions included tinnitus (which
quickly resolved when the drug was discontinued), blurred vision, and headache, which occurred on 3 days during drug
administration. One of the subjects dropped out of the study because of dizziness and drowsiness. Another subject
discontinued quinine for the last two days of the treatment period because of tinnitus. In the placebo group, one subject
reported chest pains and heartburn; another subject experienced fever and nausea; and one subject reported constipation
and dropped out of the study. An additional eight subjects dropped out of the study for reasons described in the report
as not related to the drug products, but no details were provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third study (Ref. 3) was a 5-week randomized, crossover study involving 205 subjects randomly assigned to quinine
sulfate 260 mg/day, vitamin E 1,600 international units (I.U.)/day, a combination of quinine and vitamin E in the
above doses, or placebo. Subjects were 18 to 80 years of age, with a mean age of 44. Twenty-seven adverse reactions were
reported: 9 (4.4 percent) in subjects receiving the combination of quinine and vitamin E, 8 (3.9 percent) in subjects
on quinine alone, 6 (2.9 percent) in subjects on vitamin E alone, and 4 (2 percent) in subjects receiving placebo. There
was an almost twofold difference in overall adverse experiences when subjects were taking either of the test drugs
containing quinine. Adverse events in subjects receiving quinine alone included stomach cramps, headache, nausea,
diarrhea, swollen hands, and slight muscle twitching. Adverse events in subjects receiving the quinine and vitamin
E combination included upset stomach, headache, diarrhea, tiredness, constipation, and pain in the legs. Adverse
effects in subjects receiving vitamin E included abdominal cramps, vomiting, loose bowels, headache, and intensified
menstrual cramps. Adverse events in the placebo group included nausea, stomach cramps, and tingly fingers. Gastrointestinal
disturbances were reported by twice as many subjects when they were taking quinine alone or in combination than when
assigned to vitamin E alone or placebo. Most of the adverse experiences in this study, irrespective of treatment group,
were described by investigators as not related or probably not related to the study medication. Reported events,
however, were consistent with those classically associated with quinine toxicity, which includes gastrointestinal
symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), vasodilation, sweating, headache, tinnitus, vertigo,
and visual disturbances (Ref. 6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth study (Ref. 4) was a 5-week, crossover study involving 24 subjects 51 to 64 years of age (with a mean age of
57). All subjects received placebo in weeks 1, 3, and 5; half of the subjects were assigned to quinine sulfate (260 mg
per (/) day) and half to the combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E during week 2. In week 4, those subjects on the
combination in week 2 were assigned to quinine alone and vice versa. Nausea was reported by 3 subjects (12.5 percent)
who received quinine sulfate during week 2. No details of the reported reactions were provided. No other adverse events
were reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth and largest study was a multicenter, block-randomized, parallel design involving 559 subjects 18 to 84
years of age (Ref. 5). A 1-week, single-blind, placebo phase was followed by a 2-week, double-blind, randomized,
treatment phase. Subjects who had at least one leg cramp per night for a minimum of 3 nights during the single-blind
placebo week and met other selection criteria were randomized to one of four double-blind treatment groups: Quinine
sulfate 259.2 mg (subject ages ranged from 19 to 79 years with a mean age of 46), vitamin E, 1,600 I.U. (subject ages ranged
from 18 to 76 years with a mean age of 42), a combination of quinine and vitamin E in the above doses (subject ages ranged
from 18 to 83 years with a mean age of 46), and placebo (subject ages ranged from 21 to 84 years with a mean age of 45). Besides
meeting the criteria for frequency of nocturnal leg cramps, subjects admitted to the study were generally in good
health, were predominantly female, and had a mean age of less than 50 years. The study report stated that no unexpected
or idiosyncratic adverse events were seen ``* * * among patients taking an effective course of therapy * * * nor was there
a higher than usual incidence of recognized adverse drug reactions associated with ingestion of quinine.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One subject randomized to the combination product was reported to have experienced a reaction consisting of fever,
headache, nausea, vomiting, and diffuse muscle pain after 5 days. The episode was sufficiently severe to warrant
medical intervention in which the test drug (quinine/vitamin E) was stopped and the subject was treated with analgesic/antipyretic
therapy and a prescription antiemetic. Symptoms subsided over 3 days. When the study medication was resumed, the
subject again experienced nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe headache, diffuse myalgia with severe pain
in the legs, and fever. The subject required hospitalization. Therefore, the study drug was stopped. When the subject
was discharged 5 days later, the physician advised her to consider herself sensitive to quinine. Given the temporal
relationship between the onset of symptoms and administration of the study drug as well as the positive rechallenge,
this case appears to be a well-documented hypersensitivity reaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, another subject on quinine experienced itching, nausea, and vomiting and discontinued the drug. Two
other subjects experienced moderately severe wheezing on the 8th and 12th days of quinine treatment, but neither
subject discontinued the medication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overall incidence of adverse events reported in the fifth study (Ref. 5) was high and approximately equal in all
groups (quinine sulfate, 43.3 percent; vitamin E, 37.2 percent; the combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E,
39.3 percent; and placebo, 41.3 percent). Headache accounted for the greatest number of reported events in each group
(quinine sulfate, 19.1 percent; vitamin E, 16.8 percent; combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E, 19.1 percent;
and placebo, 21 percent), but did not appear to be treatment related. Differences in the side- effect profile of the
treatments emerge when only events with an incidence of 1 percent or more are considered, and both headache and events
considered by the investigators as not related to the study drug are excluded. This analysis shows an adverse event
rate of 12.8 percent with quinine sulfate (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, tinnitus, pruritus, and urticaria);
3.6 percent with vitamin E (nausea and myalgia); and 12 percent with the combination product (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
tinnitus, and fever). None of the events reported by subjects on placebo, which the investigators considered potentially
related to the study drug, had an incidence of 1 percent or more. Similarly, events reported to be severe or moderately
severe (excluding headache and events with an incidence less than 1 percent) were more frequent in subjects taking
quinine sulfate (6.4 percent) or the combination product (7.1 percent) than vitamin E alone (3.6 percent) or placebo
(2.2 percent).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential for symptoms of quinine toxicity from the low doses generally recommended for the OTC treatment and/or
prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps has been confirmed in several other studies (Refs. 7, 8, and 9). A recent
study of the relationship between plasma quinine levels and hearing impairment (Ref. 7) found that quinine, even
at low doses, produced auditory changes. In this study, single oral doses of quinine of 5 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg),
10 mg/kg, and 15 mg/kg were administered to six healthy females 24 to 39 years of age. The study did not specify subject
weights. If subject weights of 50 to 60 kg were assumed, these doses would correspond to single quinine doses of 250
to 300 mg, 500 to 600 mg, and 750 to 900 mg, respectively. Even at the lowest dose (which is equivalent to the dose used
in OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps), a drug effect on hearing
impairment was detected in half of the subjects. When plasma concentrations exceeded 15 micromoles/liter (mmol/L),
subjective hearing loss or tinnitus was observed in all subjects. No symptoms were detectable at levels below 5 mmol/L.
The shift in hearing threshold was equal over the frequency range studied. The effect over time was consistent with
the level of the dose given. The investigators concluded that a consistent effect-concentration relationship for
hearing impairment caused by quinine can be defined by audiometry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Zajtchuk (Ref. 8) compared the effect on vestibular and auditory function of 0, 52.5 mg, and 105 mg quinine administered
in the form of commercial tonic water (containing 52.5 mg of quinine per 822 milliliter (mL) bottle) in 17 active duty
military personnel. The study was initiated following findings of low levels of quinine in post-mortem tissues from
military pilot fatalities. Tonic water was administered over a 3-hour period daily for 14 days. While control subjects
and subjects given the low dose had normal function throughout the test, three of the four subjects given 105 mg/day
developed transient vestibular abnormalities (manifested by rapid, involuntary, rhythmic movements of the eyeball
associated with certain positions of the head or body) on positional testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Worden, Shephard, and Frape (Ref. 9) conducted two similar studies. In one study, 6 men and 14 women (18 to 39 years of
age) were given 100 mg quinine hydrochloride daily in the form of tonic water for 14 days. In the second study, 4 men and
6 women (18 to 53 years of age) were divided into 2 groups. One group received 120 mg in a fortified tonic water, while
the other drank a carbonated drink without quinine. No audiometric changes were found in any of the subjects in either
study. However, 12 subjects (60 percent) in the first study complained of visual disturbances, 14 (70 percent) reported
dizziness, and 14 (70 percent) experienced headache.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential for adverse effects from quinine may be greater in the elderly. A survey at one hospital (Ref. 10) of 201
inpatients 70 years of age or older found that 23 (11 percent) were taking quinine for cramps. Sixty percent were taking
300 mg nightly; 40 percent were taking twice that amount (600 mg nightly). Approximately one-third of these subjects
had been taking the drug continuously and chronically for 2 years or more. The authors noted that the mean elimination
half-life of quinine in elderly patients has been reported to be 19 hours compared with 8.5 hours in younger adults.
The authors also stated that ``Chronic therapy is likely to result in accumulation of quinine, putting elderly patients
at greater risk of adverse effects. Possible adverse effects include symptoms of cinchonism (tinnitus, headache,
nausea, rash, visual disturbance and temporary blindness), allergic reactions, and thrombocytopenia and haemolytic
anaemia.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wanwimolruk et al. (Ref. 11) found the elimination half-life of quinine to be 18.4 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1.6 hours in 12 subjects 20 to 35 years old. Furthermore, a significantly greater amount of quinine was excreted unchanged
in the elderly subjects, suggesting that quinine metabolism is reduced in elderly people. Overall, there was a 26-percent
reduction in clearance of quinine in the older group. The authors concluded that accumulation of quinine may occur
in elderly people, thus placing them at a greater risk of adverse events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These studies indicate that serious safety concerns exist with regard to the OTC availability of quinine sulfate
for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Subjects in all studies submitted were generally
in good health, with a mean age of 44 to 57 years in the various groups. However, the adverse reactions reported in these
studies suggest that quinine doses of 260 to 325 mg/day in healthy, middle-aged adults can produce symptoms of quinine
toxicity, including auditory, visual, and gastrointestinal effects. Some studies (Refs. 7, 8, and 9) suggest that
the vestibular, auditory, visual, and vascular effects of quinine can occur in healthy young adults at doses in and
below the range commonly employed for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Altered pharmacokinetics
with age also result in a longer half-life of quinine in older people. This longer half-life increases the frequency
and severity of adverse effects in the elderly (Ref. 11), a group in which leg cramps are a common condition (Refs. 12
and 13). Therefore, the agency concludes that quinine is not safe for OTC use in the treatment and/or prevention of
nocturnal leg muscle cramps.

7. One comment (Ref. 1) requested a ban on the OTC marketing of any quinine sulfate products used in the treatment of
nocturnal recumbency leg cramps. The comment based this request, in part, on adverse reactions reported to the FDA,
including eight deaths it described as closely linked to quinine products. The comment contended that serious and
fatal adverse reactions to quinine sulfate purchased OTC for this use continue to be reported. The comment mentioned
that these reactions can occur in several ways: (1) In persons hypersensitive to quinine, (2) from the innate toxicity
of quinine, or (3) as a result of interactions with other drugs, including digoxin, anticoagulants, and antiarrhythmics.
The comment concluded that the risks associated with quinine used for leg cramps are unacceptable in light of its lack
of efficacy for this use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that quinine has the potential to elicit serious hypersensitivity reactions at doses employed
in OTC drug products used for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. The agency's spontaneous
adverse reaction reporting system includes reasonably unconfounded reports of thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia,
leukopenia, granulocytopenia, anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity syndrome, severe skin reactions (including urticaria,
angioedema, and erythema multiforme), liver abnormalities, renal failure, and death (see section I.B., comment
4). Reports in the literature have identified quinine sulfate (in doses typically recommended for the treatment
and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps) as the causative agent in cases of photosensitive dermatitis (Refs.
2, 3, and 4), psychosis (Ref. 5), disseminated intravascular coagulation (Ref. 6), and hemolytic uremic syndrome
(Ref. 7).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that quinine may interact with several other drugs (Refs. 8, 9, and 10), including those mentioned
by the comment. This information could be included in the labeling of OTC quinine drug products. However, the agency
does not need to make a decision on such drug interaction precautions because no ingredients for treating and/or preventing
nocturnal leg muscle cramps are currently generally recognized as safe and effective for inclusion in an OTC drug
monograph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cinchonism is a cluster of symptoms of varying severity that includes: Tinnitus, dizziness, disorientation, nausea,
visual changes, auditory deficits, and (at higher doses) cardiac arrhythmias. Cinchonism is dose related. The clinical
studies discussed in section I.B., comment 6 demonstrate that adverse events typical of quinine toxicity (in some
cases, sufficiently severe to lead to discontinuation of the drug) occur in some people at doses generally recommended
for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. These studies indicate that some people who self-medicate
with quinine to treat and/or prevent nocturnal leg muscle cramps at doses recommended in product labeling will experience
these quinine-related adverse events. In addition, people taking quinine remain at risk of developing hypersensitivity
to the drug and experiencing a serious, life threatening, or fatal reaction as a consequence. Even if quinine were
effective for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, this risk would require that a prescribing
physician participate in the decision to use the drug, by assuring the diagnosis, considering alternative treatment
options, evaluating concurrent medical problems and medications, and monitoring patient safety throughout treatment.

8. Several comments downplayed the potential for hypersensitivity reactions to quinine, particularly quinine-
induced immunologic thrombocytopenia, arguing that the continued OTC marketing of quinine for the treatment and/or
prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps should not be stopped because of this potential consequence of its use.
One comment (Ref. 1) submitted an expert review of drug-induced immunologic thrombocytopenia (DIITP), which stated
that DIITP has been reported with over 100 drugs. Gold salts, heparin, and the cinchona alkaloids are the drugs most
commonly associated with this condition. According to the expert review supplied by the comment, there is no known
information about the dose of quinine required to induce DIITP sensitivity. DIITP occurs more frequently in people
over 50 years old, possibly because of their greater exposure to drugs. It typically is characterized by a warm sensation,
followed by a chill. Bleeding episodes, manifested by petechiae (pinpoint red spots, caused by intradermal or submucosal
hemorrhage), purpura (purplish or brownish red discolorations visible through the skin, caused by hemorrhage into
the tissues), hemorrhagic lesions of the oral mucosa, and occasionally hemorrhage of the gastrointestinal and urinary
tracts may occur 6 to 12 hours after drug exposure in individuals who develop severe thrombocytopenia. Intracerebral
hemorrhage and lethal intrapulmonary hemorrhage have been reported. Primary treatment is to discontinue the offending
drug; bleeding usually subsides in 3 to 4 days. Other interventions (including glucocorticoid therapy and platelet
transfusions) have not been shown to be beneficial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment argued that many drugs and additives to foods have the propensity to induce a variety of adverse reactions
(Ref. 2). The comment stated that the prevalence of hypersensitivity to tartrazine (FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5), a widely
used dye, has been estimated to be about 1 in 10,000 in the general population. The comment pointed out that when tartrazine
is used in OTC drug products, a labeling statement is required to inform consumers that the product contains tartrazine
and that it may cause allergic-type reactions. The comment stated that this was ``a clear precedent for the OTC drug
use of products that have potential for rare hypersensitivity.'' The comment also described aspirin sensitivity
as widespread and emphasized that a brief warning statement in labeling regarding use by people with asthma or aspirin
sensitivity is deemed adequate to ensure safe OTC use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency finds that the information in the first comment indicates that quinine is one of the drugs most frequently
associated with DIITP. While other drugs (e.g., gold salts and heparin) cause DIITP, quinine is the only drug highly
associated with DIITP that is available OTC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March 1985, the Department of Health and Human Services established an Ad Hoc Advisory Committee on Hypersensitivity
to Food Constituents (the Committee) to evaluate data relevant to allergic-type reactions in humans that were associated
with food constituents. The Committee concluded that tartrazine may cause mild cases of urticaria (hives) in a small
subset of the population (usually not requiring medical intervention). The Committee found no evidence that the
color additive constitutes a hazard to the general public when used in food at its current levels. Prior to the Committee's
findings, the agency had decided that labeling provides an adequate safeguard for those sensitive to tartrazine.
(See the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 4, 1977 (42 FR 6835) and June 26, 1979 (44 FR 37212).) The agency requires the label of OTC and prescription
drug products containing tartrazine intended for oral, nasal, rectal, or vaginal use to specifically declare the
presence of tartrazine by listing the color additive using the names ``FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5'' and ``tartrazine.''
(See 21 CFR 74.1705(c)(2).) In addition to this label statement, prescription drug products for these uses must also
include in their labeling the warning statement ``This product contains FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which
may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall
incidence of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen
in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a number of differences between hypersensitivity reactions to tartrazine and aspirin and hypersensitivity
reactions to quinine. In a review of allergic reactions to drug additives (Ref. 3), Simon stated that reactions to
tartrazine ``if they occur at all, are indeed quite rare for the asthmatic population, even for the aspirin-sensitive
subpopulation.'' Simon further reported that no positive responses were found after 125 double-blind, placebo-controlled
tartrazine challenges (with at least 25 mg) in an aspirin-sensitive asthmatic population. Simon also reviewed adverse
reactions to food additives (Ref. 4) and stated that, although tartrazine is the food additive most frequently associated
with hypersensitivity reactions, ``tartrazine has been confirmed to be at best only occasionally associated with
flares of urticaria or asthma.'' Reports of these relatively mild tartrazine reactions, however, are in contrast
to the serious reports for quinine, which involve life threatening and fatal hypersensitivity reactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virchow et al. (Ref. 5) evaluated sensitivity to tartrazine in 156 Europeans with confirmed aspirin-induced asthma.
Oral challenges were performed with increasing doses. All positive challenges were repeated under double-blind
conditions. Only four subjects had positive reactions; none were serious. The incidence of tartrazine cross sensitivity
to aspirin in this European population was 2.6 percent. In a similar study, Morales et al. (Ref. 6) conducted 141 challenge
tests on 47 subjects with asthma associated with intolerance to analgesics, using tartrazine doses of 5, 25, 50, 100,
and 200 mg and a placebo. Only five tests were positive in four of the subjects; repeat tests were negative in three of
the four subjects. The authors stated that clinical instability in these subjects may be the cause of some respiratory
symptoms attributed to tartrazine and that the practice of recommending color free diets should be reserved for cases
in which a positive challenge test has been obtained on at least two occasions. This experience suggests that: (1)
The incidence of tartrazine sensitivity may be overestimated, and (2) the nature of reactions to tartrazine is sufficiently
benign to permit multiple rechallenges to confirm intolerance. Rechallenge of quinine-sensitive individuals,
in contrast, is contraindicated because the reactions are serious, life threatening, or fatal, even under controlled
conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safford (Ref. 7) was unable to detect antibody formation with tartrazine and its metabolites in animal studies, suggesting
that an immunologic response is not involved in tartrazine sensitivity. Hypersensitivity to quinine, in contrast,
is mediated by an immunologic mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aspirin sensitivity is relatively common compared to quinine sensitivity, but is more manageable and usually predictable.
In a review of aspirin sensitivity, Settipane (Ref. 8) described a number of factors that are predictive of subjects
in whom intolerance is most likely to occur. Sensitivity is seen in 23 to 28 percent of people with chronic urticaria,
14 to 23 percent of people with nasal polyps, and up to 19 percent of people with asthma. These people are likely to be
under a doctor's care and to have been told to avoid aspirin products. Genton et al. (Ref. 9) studied the usefulness
of oral provocation tests to aspirin and food additives in 34 subjects with asthma or chronic urticaria, concluding
that such investigations are safe and useful in managing such subjects by identifying intolerance to various compounds.
As with tartrazine, hypersensitivity to aspirin does not appear to be mediated by an immunologic response (Ref. 8).
In contrast to aspirin, there are no predictive factors for quinine hypersensitivity and, as noted above, in vivo
rechallenge is contraindicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sensitivity to aspirin (Ref. 8) and tartrazine (Ref. 10) is a problem that is manageable. The sensitivity generally
results in urticarial or bronchospastic symptoms that are responsive to medical treatment. Anaphylaxis has been
reported with aspirin, but is extremely rare given the extensive use of products containing aspirin. In a retrospective
study of anaphylaxis occurring outside of hospitals in a hospital catchment area in Denmark over a 13-year period,
the rate of anaphylaxis caused by aspirin was 0.48 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (Ref. 11). Sensitivity to quinine,
in contrast to aspirin or tartrazine, affects a number of body systems and may be serious, manifested as urticaria/angioedema,
hepatic injury, renal failure, serious dermatologic conditions, serious hematologic events, and death (Ref. 12)
(also see section I.B., comment 6). Three sources estimate the incidence of quinine-induced immunologic thrombocytopenia
to be in the range of about 1:1,000 to 1:3,000 (see section I.B., comment 9).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's spontaneous reporting system contains 110 case reports involving quinine for the period from 1969 through
1990. Sixty-nine (approximately 63 percent) of these reports represent possible hypersensitivity reactions,
including 22 reports of thrombocytopenia (57 of these cases [approximately 83 percent] involved quinine products
and/or quinine dosages typically used in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps). Of the
eight deaths that occurred among the reported hypersensitivity reactions, medical records and autopsy findings
were sufficiently complete in two of these cases (both involving OTC quinine products indicated for the treatment
of leg muscle cramps) to implicate quinine-induced thrombocytopenia as precipitating fatal hemorrhages in each
case. Underreporting of such reactions into the agency's spontaneous reporting system is believed to be very substantial
for OTC drug products. This may be due to physicians (the principal reporters to the spontaneous reporting system)
not becoming aware of reactions to OTC drugs, and because manufacturers and distributors are not generally required
to transmit reports of serious adverse reactions involving OTC drugs to FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concludes that the severity of quinine hypersensitivity reactions, even in their first occurrence, and
the inability to identify predisposing factors to this occurrence create a risk clearly different from that presented
by tartrazine or aspirin. The agency does not consider it likely that a warning statement in quinine product labeling
would be of significant value because it is impossible to prospectively identify the groups at risk (see section I.B.,
comment 10).

9. Two comments provided estimates of the incidence of quinine-induced immunologic thrombocytopenia (QIITP).
Lavy (Ref. 1) presented several estimates, each based on different assumptions and information. For one estimate,
Lavy noted that four of six hypersensitivity reactions reported to FDA in 1987 were cases of thrombocytopenia. Lavy
converted the total sales of quinine drug products for 1987 by dosage unit to ``total number of days of therapy sold''
by dividing the number of tablets and capsules sold by the dose per day described in product labeling. Lavy assumed
that quinine was taken for leg cramps approximately one quarter of the year by each subject. By dividing the ``total
days of therapy purchased'' by the ``total days used per person,'' Lavy estimated the size of the population exposed
to drug products containing quinine in 1987 to be 1.66 x 106, and calculated the incidence of QIITP to be 1 case per 415,000
people, based upon 4 cases reported to FDA that year. Lavy did not try to correct for underreporting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using another approach, Lavy reported that quinine has been estimated to be the causative agent in approximately
10 percent of all drug-induced immunologic thrombocytopenia reports. He noted that secondary thrombocytopenia
was the principal diagnosis in approximately 4,000 discharges in the 1987 National Hospital Discharge Survey. Assuming
that 10 percent of these thrombocytopenia cases were drug-induced and 10 percent of drug-induced immunologic thrombocytopenia
cases are related to quinine, 40 cases could be attributed to quinine. Assuming the population exposed to drug products
containing quinine in 1987 was 1.66 x 106 (as calculated above), Lavy calculated the incidence of QIITP to be 1:41,500.
Lavy cited a third estimate of the incidence of QIITP based on information from Danielsen's report on drug-induced
blood disorders among admissions at the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound (Ref. 2). In this retrospective study,
6 cases of thrombocytopenia related to quinine or quinidine among 5,089 subjects were reported for an apparent incidence
of 1 case per 848 subjects taking 1 or the other of the 2 drugs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment (Ref. 3) estimated the incidence of QIITP from ingestion of drug products to be 1:3,300 per year. The
comment based its calculations on the number of cases of documented quinine-induced thrombocytopenia at the Blood
Center of Southeastern Wisconsin over a 10-year period. In making this estimate, it was assumed that at least half
of all cases occurring in this population would have been referred to the laboratory for confirmation of diagnosis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that the estimates of the incidence of thrombocytopenic reactions to drug products containing quinine
range from more than 1 in 1,000 (for quinine and quinidine considered together) to less than 1 in 400,000. This wide
range suggests that a precise estimate will be hard to obtain. It is difficult to conclude, however, that the first
estimate proposed by Lavy is correct. The number of events used by Lavy is the number reported to FDA in 1987. While no
one knows the extent of underreporting, it is believed to be very substantial. For example, if even a 1 percent rate
is assumed, this would translate, using Lavy's other figures, to about 1 in 4,000 people. The exposure estimate could
also be considerably in error. Lavy assumed the drug was used for one-quarter of the year by each person. If, in fact,
it was used for one half of the year, the number of exposed people would be half that proposed and the rate of drug-induced
immunologic thrombocytopenia would be double that calculated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incidence calculated based on the National Hospital Discharge Survey (Ref. 1) employed the estimate of population
discussed above and assumed 1 percent of the diagnoses of secondary thrombocytopenia were attributable to quinine.
There is no way to know the accuracy of this estimate; if it were higher, even by a factor of 5, the estimated rate would
be above 1 in 10,000, a substantial rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Probably the most credible of Lavy's estimates is the Puget Sound-based estimate (Ref. 2), because it is based on hospital
diagnoses and well-documented exposure. The estimate of the incidence of QIITP based on the number of documented
cases occurring in the population served by the Blood Center of Southeastern Wisconsin over a 10-year period (Ref.
3) also is based on relatively few assumptions and appears reliable. The only assumption in this calculation was that
twice as many events occurred as were reported to the laboratory. The estimates from these two sources, 1:848 (Puget
Sound) and 1:3,300 (Southeastern Wisconsin) are similar to the estimate of 1:1,000 cited by Mitchell (Ref. 4). These
three sources provide a reasonably small range for the incidence of QIITP that can be expected, about 1:1,000 to 1:3,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, while the agency believes that a precise estimate of the incidence of QIITP will be difficult to obtain,
credible estimates from three sources (Refs. 2, 3, and 4) do not support the assertion that QIITP is a rare event.

10. Three comments contended that warnings in product labeling could adequately inform and protect consumers from
the well-known side effects of quinine, including idiosyncratic reactions. One comment stated that warnings recommended
by the Miscellaneous Internal Panel (47 FR 43562 at 43564), including those concerning idiosyncratic reactions,
have been incorporated into the labeling of currently marketed products. Another comment stated that careful warning
language in its product labeling helps to further protect consumers by informing them of the possibility of untoward,
idiosyncratic reactions. This labeling states: ``Discontinue use and consult your doctor immediately if swelling,
bruising, skin rash, skin discoloration or bleeding occurs. These symptoms may indicate a serious condition. Discontinue
use if ringing in the ears, deafness, diarrhea, nausea or visual disturbances occur * * * Do not take if * * * allergic
or sensitive to quinine or under 12 years of age.'' A third comment, citing a report by Lavy (Ref. 1), stated that serious
adverse effects occur at a frequency probably less than 1 in 40,000 people (see section I.A., comment 9), the clinical
course is only rarely complicated, and that labeling can clearly and concisely warn ``* * * regarding the more common
yet low frequency side effects, which are generally treated simply by discontinuing use.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the tentative final monograph (50 FR 46588 at 46592) the agency proposed the following warning in &sect;343.150(c)
for OTC drug products containing quinine: ``Discontinue use if ringing in the ears, deafness, skin rash, or visual
disturbances occur. Do not take if pregnant, sensitive to quinine, or under 12 years of age.'' The agency proposed
this labeling in the event that data were submitted that resulted in the inclusion of quinine in a monograph in the final
rule. While proposed, this labeling was not required at that time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the warning information currently appearing on OTC quinine products marketed for the treatment
and/or prevention of leg muscle cramps. The language varies slightly between products, but the information provided
is similar. In general, labeling warns patients to discontinue taking the drug should any of a number of listed events
occur. However, the labeling differs in the events listed and in recommending when a physician should be contacted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several factors that argue against the sufficiency of label warnings to protect consumers from serious
adverse events related to quinine. The frequency of these reactions is probably greater than assumed by the comments
(see section I.B., comment 9). Many of the adverse advents are unpredictable. For example, thrombocytopenia may
occur after 1 week of exposure or after months or years of quinine administration. Further, there may be no characteristic
that would predict an adverse event in the person using the product. The agency believes that a physician could help
people using this drug appreciate the nature and frequency of the risk and help in the consideration whether that risk
is acceptable. The physician could also advise about the signs of thrombocytopenia, such as petechiae (pinpoint,
nonraised, round, purplish red spots) and purpura (small hemorrhage), perhaps allowing identification of this
condition before a significant hemorrhage occurred. A number of the adverse reaction reports note the occurrence
of a similar prior event related to previous ingestion of quinine in which neither the user nor the physician recognized
the relationship of the illness to quinine ingestion. Use of quinine under a physician's prescription, with appropriate
emphasis on warning signs, may make timely recognition easier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although drug-induced immunologic thrombocytopenia may be the best studied idiosyncratic reaction caused by quinine
(Ref. 2), quinine has also been reported to have been associated with a number of other hypersensitivity reactions
and pharmacologic effects. Lavy (Ref. 1) notes that these include ``the possibility of decreased digoxin clearance,
increased half-life of quinine when given concurrently with cimetidine, pseudo-allergic reactions in aspirin-sensitive
patients, drug fever, nonspecific granulomatous hepatitis, asthma, hemolytic anemia, inhibition of tolbutamide
metabolism, hypoprothrombinemia, hemolytic anemia in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G&hyph;6&hyph;PD)
deficient patients, etc.'' Cooper and Bunn (Ref. 3) reported that G-6-PD-deficient individuals (i.e., those variants
susceptible to hemolytic anemia from quinine) are relatively common among eastern Mediterranean and Chinese people.
Quinine may also interact with several other drugs (see section I.B., comment 7). Furthermore, the possible pharmacologic
effects may have particular significance for the elderly who may be taking concomitant medications that either provoke
muscle cramps or adversely interact with quinine. Altered pharmacokinetics with age also result in a longer half-life
of quinine in older people, which suggests that the frequency and severity of adverse effects may be greater in the
elderly (Ref. 4) (also see section I.B., comment 6). The foregoing possible additional adverse reactions, including
those related to ethnicity, age, and concurrent drug therapy, are not addressed by the labeling of the comment's product
and would generally be difficult to address in OTC drug product labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that the number of reports of serious adverse reactions submitted to FDA's spontaneous reporting
system, including those resulting in hospitalization and death, has been increasing over the past several years
in spite of the industry's revision of labeling to incorporate the warnings suggested by the Miscellaneous Internal
Panel in 1982. There has been an increasing number of reports per year since 1986, and 56 of 105 reports (approximately
53 percent) have been received by FDA since 1988. (See section I.B., comment 4.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concludes there is insufficient evidence that warnings in product labeling could adequately inform and
protect consumers from the well-known side effects of quinine, including idiosyncratic reactions. This conclusion
is based primarily on the severity of hypersensitivity reactions to drug products that contain quinine and the inability
to identify predisposing factors to these reactions, the frequency of such reactions, and the relationship of quinine-related
adverse events to factors such as ethnicity, age, and concurrent drug therapy.

11. Two comments objected to the agency's discussion on the safety of vitamin E (50 FR 46588 at 46591), contending that
a considerable body of data demonstrating safety in humans had been excluded from the agency's evaluation. The comments
primarily objected to the agency's emphasis on the observations of one physician as an expert on vitamin E because
they considered the data referred to by this individual to be anecdotal, uncontrolled, and largely subjective. The
comments provided a literature review and other data (Refs. 1, 2, and 3) to support the safe use of vitamin E in humans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment disagreed with the agency's Category III classification of vitamin E both individually and in combination
with quinine sulfate for the treatment and prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, contending that adequate information
already existed to support the safety of these ingredients (alone or in combination). The comment included the results
of two new clinical studies (Refs. 4 and 5) comparing vitamin E, quinine sulfate, a combination product containing
vitamin E and quinine sulfate, and placebo to support the safe use of the individual ingredients as well as the combination
of these ingredients for this indication. In both studies, subjects received a daily dose of 1,600 I.U. of vitamin
E, either alone or in combination with quinine sulfate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One additional comment included the results of a third new clinical study comparing vitamin E, quinine sulfate, a
combination product containing vitamin E and quinine sulfate, and placebo (Ref. 6). Some safety information on vitamin
E can be derived from this study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the tentative final monograph, the agency classified vitamin E in Category III for the treatment and prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, stating that a safe and effective OTC dosage had not been established for this use (50
FR 46588 at 46591). The agency evaluated all of the data that had been submitted to this rulemaking proceeding but acknowledges
that these data were not the total body of information that has been published on vitamin E. The agency did point out
that the paper by Roberts (Ref. 7) raised some questions about a safe dose of OTC vitamin E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the additional data and information that have been submitted and determined that sufficient
evidence has been presented to support the safety of vitamin E for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg
muscle cramps. However, the evidence is inadequate to support the effectiveness of vitamin E for this use (see section
I.C., comment 13).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Farrell and Bieri (Ref. 2) evaluated potential toxic and/or beneficial effects of vitamin E intake. Twenty-eight
adults who had been self-administering 100 to 800 I.U. of vitamin E daily for an average of 3 years were studied. A review
of the subjects' past medical histories did not reveal any apparent gross evidence of toxicity from vitamin E intake.
The highest plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations in the vitamin E subjects were two times the upper limit of normal,
as determined in control subjects. A broad range of laboratory tests were performed to assess toxic effects on various
organ systems. No disturbance in liver, kidney, muscle, thyroid gland, erythrocytes, leukocytes, coagulation
parameters, or blood glucose was found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Salkeld (Ref. 1) reviewed over 9,000 cases in which daily doses of up to 3,000 I.U. of vitamin E were taken for up to 11
years (and 55,000 I.U. daily for 5 months in a few subjects). In 1,014 cases with vitamin E intake from 200 I.U. up to 3,000
I.U. daily for up to 11 years, it was stated that no side effects were observed. In another 8,241 cases with similar intake
and duration, there was no mention of side effects. In other trials, 82 of 813 subjects complained of one or more side
effects. The reported effects included dermatitis, pruritus ani, acne, cheilosis, fatigue and weakness, gastrointestinal
symptoms, prostatic obstruction, tachycardia, and vasodilation. Thus, in a total of 10,068 cases, Salkeld found
a 0.8 percent overall incidence of side effects. The Advisory Review Panel on OTC Vitamin, Mineral, and Hematinic
Drug Products relied in part on this same literature review by Salkeld in stating its conclusion ``that vitamin E is
safe'' (March 16, 1979, 44 FR 16126 at 16172). The Advisory Review Panel on OTC Antimicrobial (II) Drug Products, in
the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC topical acne drug products (March 23, 1982, 47 FR 12430), mentioned
that there are no notable pharmacological or toxicological effects of oral vitamin E and that numerous experiments
indicate that high dietary intakes of vitamin E (up to 800 I.U. daily for up to 3 years) are apparently without toxic
side effects (47 FR 12462).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the new clinical studies submitted includes the results of laboratory tests performed in 24 patients to evaluate
the effect of the product on various organ systems (Ref. 4). Tests were performed at baseline and at the end of each 1-week
treatment period. No abnormal results in liver, kidney, leukocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, electrolytes, or
blood glucose were found in any of the patients at any time. In this study vitamin E was used only in a combination product,
and each subject had a daily intake of 1,600 I.U. of vitamin E. However, the combination product was only taken during
1 week of the study. Therefore, the laboratory data do not provide any useful information on the long-term effects
of vitamin E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second new clinical study (Ref. 5) was a four-period crossover study in which each subject received 1,600 I.U.
of vitamin E daily (either singly or in a combination product) for 5 days during two of the four treatment periods of
the study. Although no laboratory tests were performed, the subjects were asked to report any adverse reactions at
the end of each treatment period. Twenty-seven adverse reactions were reported by 19 subjects out of 205 individuals
completing all phases of the study. Six of these adverse reactions were from subjects who received vitamin E singly.
Complaints included: Abdominal cramps, nausea, loose bowels, and headache. The most commonly occurring complaint
was gastrointestinal disturbance (nausea, flatulence, or diarrhea) of a transient nature. These reactions are
consistent with those previously reported in other studies; however, the investigators considered the reactions
as not related or probably not related to the study drug.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the third new clinical study (Ref. 6), vitamin E (1,600 I.U. daily for 2 weeks) was compared with placebo, quinine
sulfate, and a combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle
cramps. Details of this multicenter, parallel-design study are described in section I.C., comment 12. Vitamin E
alone was administered to 137 subjects. Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event, occurring in 23
subjects (16.8 percent). However, a similar rate of headache (21 percent) was reported in subjects taking placebo.
The investigators described only six of these events as possibly related to the study medication. Other adverse events
described by the investigators as possibly related to vitamin E included three of four reports of nausea, two of three
reports of myalgia, and one of three reports of local edema. Thus, daily doses of 1,600 I.U. of vitamin E were well tolerated
in this study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bendich and Machlin (Ref. 8) reviewed six double-blind studies involving vitamin E at doses as high as 3,200 I.U. daily
for up to 6 months. Very few adverse effects were noted, and no specific side effect was consistently observed in all
the studies. In one study, 202 college students received 600 I.U. of vitamin E or placebo daily for 28 days in a randomized,
double-blind trial (Ref. 9). No effects on prothrombin time, total blood leukocyte count, or serum creatine phosphokinase
activity were evident. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 30 healthy adults were given 800
I.U. of vitamin E or placebo daily for 16 weeks. There were no significant differences in effects on plasma lipids between
the vitamin E and placebo groups (Ref. 10). No side effects were observed in a double-blind, crossover study of 48 subjects
who received 1,600 I.U. of vitamin E or placebo daily for a period of 6 months (Ref. 11). There were no reports of significant
side effects, weakness, fatigue, or thrombophlebitis in a double-blind, crossover study in which 2,000 I.U. of vitamin
E or placebo was given daily to 25 adult onset-diabetic subjects for a period of 6 weeks (Ref. 12). Thyroid hormone levels
were found to be identical for both the treatment and placebo periods. Hale et al. (Ref. 13) examined the incidence
of various clinical disorders and measured a number of laboratory variables in 369 subjects who used vitamin E supplements
and 1,861 subjects who did not. All subjects were over age 65. Use of vitamin E appeared to have little influence on clinical
disorders or hematologic or biochemical parameters. Only the serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase was higher
in vitamin E users. However, the values were still within the accepted normal range. There were no significant differences
between users and nonusers in the prevalence of hypertension, vaginal bleeding, frequent headache, dizziness,
recurrent diarrhea, diabetus mellitus, lightheaded-ness, or thyroid disorders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Roberts (Ref. 7) raised concerns about an increased incidence of thrombophlebitis associated with excessive vitamin
E intake. In over 10 years of practice, Roberts encountered more than 80 patients with problems that he attributed
to self-medication with high doses of vitamin E (greater than 800 I.U. daily). He suggested that vitamin E may encourage
thrombosis in patients with a predisposing condition. Symptoms of thrombophlebitis were said to have abated upon
cessation of vitamin E therapy. Conventional treatment for thrombophlebitis (e.g., bed rest, local heat) was administered
along with the discontinuation of vitamin E therapy. Thus, it is difficult to assess which action was responsible
for the improvement. In addition, no controlled studies or concurrent references were included in support of his
conclusions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fitzgerald and Brash (Ref. 14) stated that vitamin E at 1,600 I.U. a day in humans decreases platelet thromboxane production
which could consequently reduce the potential for thrombosis formation. In addition, they noted that associations
between thrombophlebitis and vitamin E use have not been reported by other authors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several authors (Refs. 2, 9, and 15) have reported that oral intake of high doses of vitamin E has not produced blood
coagulation abnormalities in normal humans. However, in individuals deficient in vitamin K (caused by malabsorption,
diet, or anticoagulant therapy), large doses of vitamin E can exacerbate coagulation defects. Therefore, high levels
of supplemental vitamin E may be contraindicated in such conditions (Ref. 8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the discussion above, the agency concludes that sufficient evidence exists to support the safety of vitamin
E at the daily doses that have been commonly used for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.

C. Comments on the Effectiveness of Nocturnal Leg Muscle Cramp Ingredients
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. One comment disagreed with the agency's Category III classification of quinine sulfate for the treatment and/or
prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps on the basis of a lack of adequate clinical data demonstrating the effectiveness
of quinine sulfate for this indication (50 FR 46588 at 46590). The comment contended that there is sufficient evidence
of quinine's effectiveness for this indication at present to warrant classifying it in Category I. The comment subsequently
submitted the results of two clinical studies (Refs. 1 and 2) comparing quinine sulfate, vitamin E, a combination
product containing quinine sulfate and vitamin E, and placebo for the treatment and prevention of nocturnal leg muscle
cramps to support the effectiveness of the individual ingredients (quinine sulfate and vitamin E) as well as the combination
of these ingredients for this indication. Another comment provided the results of three clinical studies (Refs.
3, 4, and 5) that it felt addressed the effectiveness issues raised by the agency in the tentative final monograph (50
FR 46590). This comment requested an oral hearing if the submitted data were not found adequate to upgrade quinine
sulfate to Category I. In addition, in response to a citizen petition, one comment included the results of a clinical
study intended to demonstrate the efficacy of a combination product containing quinine sulfate and vitamin E (Ref.
6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the tentative final monograph, the agency concluded, on the basis of its review of the new data submitted and the
studies and information discussed by the Internal Analgesic and Miscellaneous Internal Panels, that quinine sulfate
for use in OTC drug products for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps should be classified
in Category III. The agency stated that adequate clinical data are necessary to support the reclassification of quinine
from Category III to Category I and that any such studies should address the following safety and effectiveness issues
(50 FR 46588 at 46590):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is quinine effective in treating and/or preventing nocturnal leg muscle cramps in low daily doses (e.g., 200 to
325 mg) over short periods of time (e.g., 7 days or less)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If short-term quinine treatment with low doses is not significantly effective in reducing recurrent episodes
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, must such medication be taken over extended periods of time to obtain relief? If yes,
how long a period of time?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) What adverse effects are experienced by subjects exposed to effective doses of quinine over an effective course
of therapy?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the additional clinical data that have been submitted and determined that they are not adequate
to support the reclassification of quinine sulfate to Category I for this use. Three studies (Refs. 3, 4, and 5) compared
quinine to placebo. In one study (Ref. 3), 75 subjects were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
crossover study that was conducted over a 10-week period in five 2-week intervals. Subjects with a history of at least
two cramps per week for at least 3 months were included in this study and randomized to one of two treatment groups (group
I or II). The initial 2-week period was a baseline period and patients who failed to have at least two cramps per week
were dropped from the study. Subjects who had a sufficient number of cramps during the baseline period were either
given the placebo (group I) or 325 mg of quinine sulfate per night (group II) for a period of 2 weeks. No treatment was
given for the next 2-week period and in the fourth 2-week period subjects crossed over to the alternate treatment.
A final 2-week period of no treatment followed. Subjects were issued weekly case report forms upon which they were
instructed to record the number of cramps experienced per night, the time of the cramp, and the severity of the cramp.
Subjects were also asked to rate the effectiveness of the medication just completed at weeks 4 and 8 of the study. According
to the protocol, subjects were assigned to the treatment sequence, on the basis of a predetermined randomization
schedule, prior to entering the baseline period. Therefore, the removal of subjects from the study in the first 2 weeks
for not having enough events may have biased the study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the statistical analysis of the study data, three efficacy variables were evaluated: The mean frequency of leg
cramps (per night), the mean severity of leg cramps per night, and the total number of nights per week that leg cramps
occurred. The last variable (total number of nights per week that leg cramps occurred) appears to be constructed from
the primary data because no such variable is listed on the weekly case report forms from which these variables are derived.
The subjects' overall assessment of the effectiveness of the drug was collected but not analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixty-two of the 75 subjects enrolled in the study were included in the data analysis. Of the 13 subjects found to be
unevaluable, 8 withdrew from the study on their own accord. No specific reasons for these withdrawals were given,
but it is stated in the study report that they were unrelated to the treatment. The remaining five subjects were dropped
for various medical reasons and noncompliance with the protocol. No ``intent-to-treat'' analysis was performed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of analyses were carried out. Two of the analyses treated the unblinded baseline and washout periods as if
they were treatment periods. This type of analysis is incorrect for a crossover trial. The relevant comparisons that
should be made are between the treatments in the double-blind periods, possibly with adjustments for baseline, provided
there are no major changes in baseline values for each period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When Patel's joint test for equal carryover and equal pretreatment severity (Ref. 7) is applied to the data, however,
significant differences are seen in pretreatment severity before the second period. Analysis of the second period
is thus compromised; therefore, analysis should be limited to the first treatment period (weeks 3 and 4). This comparison
does not show a significant advantage for quinine sulfate over placebo for any of the effectiveness variables.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another clinical study (Ref. 4) used the same study design as the study discussed above except that the dose of quinine
sulfate was 260 mg/night, not the 325 mg/night used in the first study. In addition, five efficacy variables were analyzed:
Frequency, severity, and duration of leg cramps, and induction and quality of sleep. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the predetermined randomization chart submitted for this study provided for enrollment of 74 subjects,
84 subjects entered the study. No explanation for entry of the additional 10 subjects was provided. As in the first
study, randomization to treatment sequence occurred at the time of entry into the baseline period; thus, subsequent
removal of subjects prior to the first double-blind treatment period may also have introduced bias into this study.
Of the 84 subjects entered at baseline, 69 (34 assigned to group I and 35 to group II) entered the double- blind treatment
phase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study concluded that significant differences at the 5-percent level exist between quinine sulfate and placebo
for three of the five variables: Frequency of cramps, induction of sleep, and quality of sleep. However, no documentation
of any statistical analysis supporting these claims was provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statistical report that accompanied the study addressed the question of comparing the effectiveness of quinine
sulfate and placebo with a multivariate analysis of covariance which compared the vector of efficacy variables over
four observation periods (two treatment periods plus two washout periods with the initial baseline value as a covariate).
The conclusion of the analysis was that the treatment effect was not significant (p = 0.106). Univariate analyses
of covariance comparing these four observation periods were referred to in the statistical report, but no p-values
for treatment effect were provided (although a significant order by treatment interaction was reported). Also included
in the statistical analyses of the study were comparisons of the four observation periods separately by sequence
(quinine sulfate-placebo and placebo-quinine sulfate), which included baseline-adjusted means and comparisons
between periods using Duncan's Multiple Range Test. These comparisons showed that significant differences were
demonstrated between quinine and placebo only for the placebo-quinine sulfate sequence (group II), and only for
three variables: Frequency of cramps, quality of sleep, and induction of sleep. However, the adjusted means for the
quinine sulfate-placebo sequence (group I) favored placebo over quinine sulfate for all five efficacy variables.
In addition, as for the first study, the appropriate statistical analysis for this type of study was not done. The hypothesis
of equal carryover effect was not tested and not rejected before any of the other statistical tests for treatment effect
were performed. The results of this study are not adequate to support the effectiveness of quinine sulfate for the
treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study by Jones and Castleden (Ref. 5) also does not provide adequate evidence of quinine sulfate's effectiveness
for this indication. The study was a double-blind crossover study of nine patients with four 2-week periods of observation
(a run-in period and a washout period in addition to two treatment periods of placebo or quinine sulfate 300 mg/day).
The same five efficacy values as in the second study above were evaluated: Frequency, severity, and duration of leg
cramps, and induction and quality of sleep. No raw data were included to substantiate any of the statistical claims
made by the authors; nor was a protocol included in the article.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the five primary efficacy variables, only severity of cramps was claimed to show a significant difference between
quinine sulfate and placebo (p &lt; 0.025), although an analysis of frequency of cramps after 2 a.m. was also claimed
to be significant (p &lt; 0.025). There was no indication that the time period after 2 a.m. was identified in the protocol
as defining a primary endpoint; thus, this is assumed to be a post-hoc analysis done after reviewing the data. In general,
the isolated severity finding is not convincing on its face. In addition, the published article did not provide sufficient
information to permit an independent analysis of the data. For these reasons, the study does not provide evidence
that quinine sulfate is an effective treatment for nocturnal leg muscle cramps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three studies (Refs. 1, 2, and 6) were submitted to support the effectiveness of quinine sulfate and vitamin E individually
and in combination for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. The Freiburg study (Ref. 1)
was a 5-week, double-blind, randomized, crossover study in 24 subjects. All subjects received placebo during week
1 (baseline), week 3, and week 5. Subjects in group I received quinine in week 2 and the combination of quinine and vitamin
E in week 4, while subjects in group II were given the combination product in week 2 and quinine in week 4. A statistically
significant difference in frequency of attacks between the combination product and quinine sulfate was reported,
but no difference in duration or severity of attack was found between these two active treatments. The report described
an ``obvious'' improvement in frequency, duration, and severity of attacks between the placebo periods and both
active treatments, but no statistical evidence or analysis to support this conclusion was provided. Moreover, the
comparison of treatments and placebo did not involve randomized patient groups, nor was it blinded. Only the portion
of the study comparing the combination product versus quinine was a randomized, double-blind trial. The study report
did not include the study protocol, details of the statistical analysis conducted, or individual subject data. The
model described in the summary of the data analysis did not properly separate carryover effect from treatment effect.
The study provides no evidence from a controlled trial that quinine is effective for nocturnal leg muscle cramps.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other study (Ref. 2) also employed a complicated randomized, four-period, crossover design. There were 205 subjects
randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: Quinine sulfate 260 mg/day, vitamin E 1,600 I.U./day, a combination
of quinine and vitamin E, or placebo. The combination of quinine and vitamin E was reported as being statistically
superior to both its components and placebo for six variables: Effect of cramps on falling asleep, nighttime awakening
due to cramps, number of cramps, severity of cramps, subject global evaluation, and difficulty falling asleep due
to cramps. The study also reported statistically significant positive findings on quinine sulfate versus placebo
for the first five of these six variables. As in the Freiburg study, the model used in the statistical analysis does
not properly separate the carryover effect from the treatment effect. Neither the data listings nor the results by
period were provided. Therefore, the agency was unable to independently analyze the results of this study or to rely
on the analysis provided as evidence that the reported results were attributable to drug treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third clinical study compared quinine sulfate, vitamin E, and a combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E to
placebo, for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps (Ref. 6). This study was a multicenter,
randomized, block parallel-design with a single-blind, placebo, run-in period, followed by a 2-week, double-blind,
randomized, treatment phase. Subjects who had at least one leg cramp per night for a minimum of 3 nights during the single-blind
placebo week, and met all other selection criteria, were randomly assigned to one of the four double-blind treatment
groups. Capsules, identical in appearance, contained either placebo, quinine sulfate 64.8 mg, vitamin E 400 I.U.,
or a combination of quinine sulfate 64.8 mg and vitamin E 400 I.U. Subjects were instructed to take two capsules following
their evening meal, and two capsules before bedtime, which provided daily doses of 259.2 mg of quinine sulfate, 1,600
I.U. of vitamin E, or the combination thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Efficacy endpoints identified in the protocol were: (1) Number of episodes of nocturnal leg cramps per week, (2) sleep
disturbance due to nocturnal leg cramps, (3) severity of nocturnal leg cramps, and (4) duration of nocturnal leg cramps.
However, none of the parameters was designated as a primary efficacy variable in the protocol. The protocol specified
that efficacy would be analyzed by analysis of variance with repeated measures test, as well as other methods deemed
appropriate. On the basis of an estimated 30 percent difference between the combination product and its components,
assuming an alpha of 0.05 and statistical power of 70 percent, a sample size of 972 evaluable subjects was planned (243
subjects/group). Enrollment was suspended, however, and the data were analyzed after 498 evaluable subjects (51
percent) completed the study. Subjects were approximately evenly distributed among treatment groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final report, results were separately analyzed for weeks 1 and 2 of the double-blind treatment. The change from
baseline scores obtained during the single-blind, placebo week was analyzed on seven variables for each of the treatment
groups at days 7 and 14 using a two-way analysis of variance test with terms for treatment, center, and treatment by
center interaction. The data were not analyzed using the analysis of variance with repeated measures test, as prospectively
stated in the protocol. The variables were: (1) Number of nights per week with leg cramps, (2) average number of leg
cramps per night, (3) average severity of leg cramps per night, (4) average duration of leg cramps per night, (5) average
number of leg cramps per night with sleeping difficulty, (6) average degree of difficulty getting to sleep per night,
and (7) average number of nights per week awakened by leg cramps. The placebo group was compared with the remaining
treatment groups with the least-significant-difference test using error mean square from the analysis of variance
table. Within each treatment group, the amount of change from baseline for each efficacy parameter was compared for
each double-blind treatment week using the Wilcoxon sign rank test. P-values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically
significant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twelve centers initially participated in the study. Three centers were terminated because of low enrollment (less
than four evaluable subjects in at least one treatment group). These low enrollment centers were combined in the analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final report, the number of nights per week with leg cramps was declared the primary efficacy variable. During
the baseline period, a mean of approximately 5 nights per week with leg cramps was recorded in all groups (placebo 4.72,
combination 4.95, quinine sulfate 5.04, vitamin E 4.98). All groups improved during week 1 with a reduction in frequency
to approximately 4 nights per week with cramps (placebo 4.04, combination 3.73, quinine sulfate 3.53, vitamin E 3.97).
The greatest reductions were in subjects given quinine sulfate and the combination product and the difference in
week 1 was found to be statistically significant compared to placebo for these treatment groups (p less than or equal
to 0.04). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Statistically significant differences between quinine sulfate and placebo were reported in the first week of the
study for four of the six remaining efficacy variables declared to be secondary parameters in the final report. Quinine
was reported to be significantly better than placebo in reducing the average number of leg cramps per night, average
severity of leg cramps per night, average duration of leg cramps per night, and average number of nights per week with
sleeping difficulty. No statistically significant differences between any of the treatment groups for any variable
were reported for the second week of the study. The comment concluded that quinine sulfate, alone and in combination
with vitamin E, at a daily dose of approximately 260 mg was safe and effective in the short term (1-week) treatment of
nocturnal leg muscle cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency finds that there were a number of flaws in the analysis of this study. First, the primary endpoint (number
of nights per week with leg cramps) appears to have been arbitrarily chosen after the study was completed. None of the
efficacy variables was declared the primary endpoint in the protocol. Second, the study was of 2 week's duration,
and there was no provision in the protocol for separate evaluation of the data from week 1 and week 2. Thus, there is no
basis for the decision to analyze week 1 and week 2 separately in the absence of such an analysis declared prospectively
in the protocol. In fact, an analysis of both weeks together (see below) does not show a significant benefit of quinine.
Third, an adjustment for multiple comparisons should have been included in the data analysis. Given seven variables,
two active treatments, and at least three time points at which data could be analyzed (first week, second week, both
weeks), the nominally significant differences between treatments at the end of week one would not be expected to retain
statistical significance if an adjustment for multiple comparisons were included in the analysis. Even considering
the retrospectively identified primary endpoint, a correction for three ``looks'' (week 1, week 2, and together)
would at least double the nominal p-value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even without correction for multiplicity, the results do not support the conclusion that quinine sulfate and vitamin
E, alone or in combination, are effective for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. First,
week 2 results fail to replicate the results of week 1. No differences between any of the treatment groups for any parameter
were found at the end of week 2, nor was the investigators' global assessment, conducted at the end of the 2-week double-blind
period, able to differentiate between treatments. Second, a significant treatment by center interaction was found
for the reported superiority of quinine sulfate over placebo in week 1 in reducing the number of nights per week with
leg cramps. The result was driven by two of nine centers. In one of these centers, the combination product was indistinguishable
from placebo, and in the other, the superiority of placebo over the combination neared statistical significance
(p = 0.10). Thus, in the two clinics responsible for the favorable week 1 results of treatment with quinine, there was
a failure to replicate the result reported with quinine sulfate alone. Vitamin E was ineffective in all parameters
measured throughout the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The four retrospectively-declared secondary endpoints for which statistically significant reductions were reported
in week 1 in the quinine sulfate group compared to placebo were: (1) The number of cramps per night, (2) the number of
nights with sleeping difficulty, (3) the severity of the cramps, and (4) the duration of the cramps. Although a consistent
benefit on these endpoints would render a finding on the primary endpoint more persuasive, as with the primary efficacy
endpoint, none of the differences between active treatment and placebo persisted through to the end of week 2. For
the reasons discussed above, the post hoc, week-1 analysis of these endpoints fails to provide convincing evidence
to support the efficacy of quinine sulfate for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two additional analyses of the results of the study were submitted (Refs. 8 and 9). The first (Ref. 8) was an analysis
of the number of leg cramps per day for each day of the study. This analysis showed occasional days in which quinine was
superior to placebo, but is on the whole not helpful. Given an entry cramp rate of one cramp episode per night for at least
3 nights per week, significant differences in any endpoint would not be expected on a day-by-day (i.e., noncumulative)
evaluation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second analysis (Ref. 9) was of the total cramp rate (mean number of cramps per day over the course of the entire study
period) for both the evaluable subset of subjects and the intent-to-treat population. Two analyses were performed
on each group. In one analysis, only those subjects who completed the study with at least 14 days of treatment (the completer
analysis) were analyzed, while the other analysis involved the results from all subjects with efficacy observations
(the endpoint analysis) for the quinine sulfate and placebo treatment groups. In the endpoint analyses, where less
than 14 days of treatment was completed, leg cramps for the observed number of days were calculated, and the mean was
carried forward to 14 days. None of the four analyses revealed statistically significant reductions in the mean number
of leg cramps experienced during 14 days of treatment in the quinine-treated subjects compared with placebo subjects.
The endpoint analysis for evaluable patients approached statistical significance for quinine sulfate (p = 0.06),
but the results of the completer analysis for evaluable subjects and both intent-to-treat analyses were clearly
negative. The total cramp rate over the entire study is the most straightforward effectiveness measure; it did not
show a drug effect on cramps. While the favorable trend on one analysis could suggest activity, the study was already
of very substantial size and should have been able to detect a clinically meaningful response. This study, therefore,
does not provide evidence of efficacy of quinine sulfate, vitamin E, or the combination thereof in the treatment and/or
prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above discussion, the agency concludes that the submitted data are inadequate to establish the effectiveness
of quinine sulfate for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Further, the agency concludes
that the submitted data do not adequately address the safety and effectiveness issues raised by the agency in the tentative
final monograph (see discussion above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional agency comments and evaluations of the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Refs. 10, 11,
and 12).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commissioner has determined that there are not reasonable grounds in support of a hearing and that a hearing on
this issue is not warranted. Six clinical trials have been submitted and have failed to establish the safety and efficacy
of quinine sulfate in treating and/or preventing nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Occasional significant differences
favoring quinine were not replicated within or between studies. In two crossover design studies (Refs. 3 and 4), appropriate
analyses revealed no significant differences between quinine sulfate and placebo. The results of a very large parallel-design,
2-week study showed no significant effect in an analysis of the 2-week data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, deficiencies in the studies themselves render the reported results unreliable. Each of these studies
involved multiple endpoints, none of which was prospectively declared as the primary efficacy variable(s) in any
of the studies. There was no attempt to correct significance levels for multiple endpoints. The design of one study
did not permit the independent evaluation of the efficacy of quinine sulfate alone (Ref. 1). In three crossover studies
(Refs. 2, 3, and 4), the treatment effect was confounded by potential carryover effect and baseline differences.
The 2-week, parallel-design study (Ref. 6) showed no effect overall for the entire treatment period, including the
investigator's global assessment. Only by considering the results of week 1 separately, an unplanned analysis,
was any significant difference between quinine and placebo found in this study, and this finding was confounded by
a significant treatment-by-center interaction. For these reasons, the studies cannot be considered adequate and
well-controlled clinical investigations as required under &sect;330.10(a)(4)(ii). The Commissioner concludes
that a hearing on this issue is not justified for the reasons stated above.

13. One comment disagreed with the agency's Category III classification of vitamin E for the treatment and/or prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps on the basis of a lack of adequate clinical data demonstrating the effectiveness of
vitamin E for this indication (50 FR 46588 at 46591). The comment contended that there is sufficient evidence of vitamin
E's effectiveness for this indication at present to warrant classifying it in Category I. The comment subsequently
submitted the results of two clinical studies (Refs. 1 and 2) comparing vitamin E, quinine sulfate, a combination
product containing vitamin E and quinine sulfate, and placebo for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg
muscle cramps to support the effectiveness of the individual ingredients (vitamin E and quinine sulfate) as well
as the combination of these ingredients for this indication. In addition, in responding to a citizen petition, one
comment included a clinical study comparing vitamin E, quinine sulfate, a combination product containing both ingredients,
and placebo (Ref. 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the tentative final monograph, the agency concluded that there was a lack of controlled studies demonstrating
the effectiveness of vitamin E in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. The agency also
determined that a safe and effective OTC dosage of vitamin E had not been established (50 FR 46588 at 46591). Therefore,
the agency classified vitamin E in Category III for this use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the additional clinical data that have been submitted and determined that they are not adequate
to support the reclassification of vitamin E to Category I for this use. In one double-blind, randomized, crossover
study (Ref. 1), a combination product containing 64.8 mg quinine sulfate and 400 I.U. of vitamin E in a lecithin base
was compared to 64.8 mg of quinine sulfate for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps in subjects
with a history of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Subjects were randomized into two groups. All subjects took placebo
during week 1 and at the end of week 1 only those subjects reporting at least three cramps per week were allowed to continue
in the study. One group received the combination product during week 2 and quinine sulfate during week 4, while for
the other group this order was reversed. Both groups also received placebo during weeks 3 and 5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both quinine sulfate and the combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E were reported to reduce the frequency of
nocturnal leg muscle cramps in this study. A greater reduction in the frequency of these leg cramps was observed in
subjects taking the combination product compared to subjects taking quinine alone. The difference was reported
to be statistically significant using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. No significant differences were found between
treatments for either duration or severity of attacks. However, as previously discussed (see section I.C., comment
12), the study report did not include the study protocol, details of the statistical analysis, or individual subject
data, and the analysis described does not properly separate carryover effect from treatment effect. Therefore,
it is not possible to conclude that either treatment used in this study was effective for this indication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second clinical study (Ref. 2) was a double-blind, randomized, crossover study conducted at two sites and involved
subjects with at least a 3-month history of at least two significant nocturnal leg muscle cramps per week. The subjects
did not receive any drug for the first 1-week run-in period, then received four treatment periods (5 days each) that
were separated by a 2-day washout period that included a 2-day drug-free period after the last treatment period. Thus,
each subject received each of the four treatments (quinine sulfate 64.8 mg in combination with 400 I.U. vitamin E,
64.8 mg quinine sulfate, 400 I.U. vitamin E, and placebo). A total of 205 subjects (out of 209 subjects originally enrolled)
completed the study at the two locations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each morning upon arising, subjects recorded on a daily evaluation form their response to questions regarding their
difficulty or failure to get to sleep due to night leg cramps and whether or not the cramps had awakened them the previous
night. Subjects were also asked to rate on a scale from 0 (no cramps) to 3 (very difficult) the effect of leg cramps on
their ability to fall asleep and to record the number, time of occurrence, duration, and severity of leg cramps on the
evaluation form. At the end of each weekly treatment period, subjects were asked to complete a global evaluation form
and to record any change in their condition during that period, as follows: Greatly improved, slightly improved,
no improvement, or worse. Subjects who selected ``worse'' were asked to explain why. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment's statistical analysis of the study evaluated the following variables based on portions of the subjects'
daily evaluation forms and their global evaluation of treatment effect: (1) Number of nights per week subjects had
difficulty getting to sleep due to night leg cramps, (2) effect of leg cramps on subject's ability to get to sleep, (3)
number of nights per week that leg cramps prevented subjects from going to sleep, (4) number of nights per week that
leg cramps woke subjects up, (5) number of leg cramps per week, (6) severity of the leg cramps, and (7) subjects' global
evaluations of how their condition changed over the previous week. In addition, the following parameters were derived
from these variables and evaluated: (1) Number of nights per week with leg cramps, (2) mean number of leg cramps per
night, (3) total severity score during each week, (4) mean effect of leg cramps on sleep per week, and (5) mean severity
per cramp. Separate analyses of the results from each site and analysis of pooled results from both study cites were
reported. Vitamin E was found to be statistically significantly superior to placebo in 7 of the 12 efficacy variables
evaluated on the basis of the combined data and in 6 of the 12 variables on the basis of data from at least one of the locations.
The combination was found to be statistically superior to the individual ingredients and placebo on 11 out of the 12
variables evaluated on the basis of both the combined data and data from at least one of the locations. On that same basis,
quinine sulfate was found to be statistically superior to placebo in 9 of the 12 variables evaluated and to vitamin
E in 1 of the 12 variables. The comment concluded that quinine and vitamin E were significantly additive in their effects,
and that it was this additive effect that resulted in the highly significant superiority of the combination over its
individual components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined that the statistical analysis presented with this study is inadequate for review because
the model used does not properly separate the carryover effect from the treatment effect. The model consisted of a
sequence or code effect, a subject within code effect, a visit effect, and a treatment effect. For a given subject,
this model says that code effect is constant over all visits; thus, carryover effect must be partially confounded
with treatment effect. Therefore, the analysis presented cannot be relied upon to demonstrate the efficacy of any
of the treatments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third clinical study was a multicenter, randomized, block, parallel-design with a single-blind, placebo, run-in
period, followed by a 2-week double-blind, randomized, treatment phase (see section I.C., comment 12). No statistically
significant treatment effect of vitamin E was detected at the end of the double-blind phase for any variable in this
study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concludes that the submitted data are inadequate to establish the effectiveness of vitamin E or the combination
of vitamin E and quinine sulfate for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Therefore, both
vitamin E individually and in combination with quinine sulfate are nonmonograph conditions.

D. Comments on Labeling
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. Several comments requested revisions in parts of the labeling proposed in the tentative final monograph. Two
comments disagreed with the agency's statement of identity. One comment argued that it was a restatement of the indication
proposed in &sect;343.150(b). In place of the agency's proposed statement of identity (``nocturnal leg muscle cramps
treatment and/or prevention''), one comment requested that ``muscle relaxant pain reliever'' or ``analgesic''
be used. The comment contended that its suggestions were more descriptive of general pharmacological categories
as described in 21 CFR 201.61. Another comment suggested changing the statement to ``night leg cramp relief,'' arguing
that this statement would be more ``meaningful to the layman'' in accord with 21 CFR 201.61. The comment added that
its suggested term is currently used in the labeling of a major OTC quinine product and reflects a more contemporary
description of the condition being treated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Referring to the warning proposed in &sect;343.150(c) that reads ``Discontinue use if ringing in the ears, deafness,
skin rash, or visual disturbances occur,'' one comment requested that the words ``and consult a physician'' be added
following ``discontinue use.'' The comment believed that such a warning would facilitate further medical treatment,
if deemed necessary. The comment added that the agency had proposed similar warnings in other OTC drug monographs,
for example, proposed &sect;333.50(c)(2) and (c)(3) for topical acne drug products (January 15, 1985, 50 FR 2172
at 2181). The comment explained that this addition to the warning would better serve the elderly, the population most
likely to use the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment recommended that the agency distinguish between treatment and prevention directions for the drug, and
proposed the following: ``When night leg cramps occur, take 200&hyph;325 mg at once. To help prevent further night
leg cramps, take 200&hyph;325 mg two hours before bedtime for 14 days. Do not exceed more than 325 mg daily.'' The comment
concluded that, in providing adequate directions for use, it is appropriate to discuss dosages for initial onset
of leg muscle cramps and for prevention of future cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No ingredients for treating and/or preventing nocturnal leg muscle cramps are currently generally recognized as
safe and effective for inclusion in an OTC drug monograph; thus, no OTC labeling is being finalized at this time. Accordingly,
the comments' requests are not being addressed in this document. However, in the event that any ingredient for treating
and/or preventing nocturnal leg muscle cramps reaches OTC drug monograph status, the agency will determine appropriate
labeling at that time and publish it in a future issue of the

II. The Agency's Final Conclusions on OTC Drug Products For The Treatment and/or Prevention of Nocturnal Leg Muscle
Cramps
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency concludes that the data and information submitted are inadequate to establish the safety and effectiveness
of quinine sulfate, vitamin E, or the combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E for the treatment and/or prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three clinical studies of vitamin E, alone or in combination with quinine sulfate, were submitted. The report of one
of the studies provided no details of the statistical analysis conducted; the model described in the summary of the
analysis failed to separate carryover effect from treatment effect; and neither the protocol nor the individual
subject data were provided. Independent verification of the conclusions presented, therefore, was not possible.
On the basis of the information provided in the report, no conclusions about the efficacy of vitamin E are possible
from this study. In another study, a statistically significant effect of vitamin E was reported in 7 of 12 endpoints,
and statistically significant differences from placebo were reported in 11 of 12 endpoints for the combination product.
In this study, however, treatment effect was confounded by carryover effect making it impossible to ascribe observed
differences to vitamin E. Further, the third study, a large, multicenter, 2-week, parallel-design study comparing
vitamin E, quinine sulfate, a combination of vitamin E and quinine sulfate, and placebo showed no significant difference
for vitamin E compared to placebo on any parameter at the end of the double-blind treatment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six clinical trials were submitted to establish the safety and efficacy of quinine sulfate in treating and/or preventing
nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Effectiveness results reported as significant were not replicated within or between
studies. In two crossover studies, significant differences between quinine sulfate and placebo were seen only in
the second leg of the crossover, and there were significant pretreatment differences. Analysis of the first leg of
these crossover studies showed no effect of quinine. In a large, 2-week, parallel study of quinine sulfate, vitamin
E, and the combination of these ingredients versus placebo, no statistically significant differences were found
between active treatments and placebo for the full 2 weeks of the study. Furthermore, each study involved multiple
endpoints, none of which was prospectively declared as the primary efficacy variable(s) in any study. Statistical
analysis was conducted without regard to adjustment for multiple comparisons, casting doubt on the validity of claimed
statistical significance in many cases. In three crossover studies, the treatment effect was confounded by potential
carryover effect making it impossible to attribute the results to the study drugs. The agency concludes that the data
and information submitted do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness of quinine sulfate, vitamin E, or
a combination of quinine sulfate and vitamin E, in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, new information has raised serious safety concerns over the OTC availability of quinine sulfate for this
use. Adverse events characteristic of quinine toxicity were observed in the healthy populations enrolled in the
clinical efficacy studies at doses of 260 mg and 325 mg daily. These events included: Visual, auditory, and gastrointestinal
symptoms, and fever. Studies of auditory, vestibular, and visual function in subjects given quinine confirm sensory
disturbances at even lower doses. Altered pharmacokinetics with age results in a longer half-life of quinine in older
people that suggests the frequency and severity of adverse effects may be greater in the elderly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these adverse effects, serious and unpredictable hypersensitivity reactions to quinine occur. Symptoms
are often dramatic, leading people to seek medical treatment. Hospitalization may be required, and fatalities have
been reported. While quinine-induced thrombocytopenia is the hypersensitivity reaction most frequently reported
to the agency's spontaneous reporting system, estimates of the incidence of quinine-induced thrombocytopenia
are unreliable. Estimates based on the most direct evidence, however, suggest occurrence rates between 1:1,000
and 1:3,500. Quinine is the only drug available OTC that has such a high association with this serious hematologic
sensitivity. Because there are no known factors that predispose people to the development of hypersensitivity to
quinine, which may occur after 1 week of exposure or after months or years of use, label warnings cannot be expected
to protect consumers from hypersensitivity reactions to quinine products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the benign nature of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, the failure of the clinical studies to demonstrate efficacy
of quinine sulfate in this condition, the evidence of symptoms of quinine toxicity at the OTC doses employed for leg
cramps in a proportion of the target population, and the potential for serious, life threatening, and fatal hypersensitivity
reactions to quinine, the agency concludes that quinine is not safe for OTC use in the treatment and/or prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received in response to the agency's request for specific comment on the economic impact of this rulemaking
(47 FR 43562 and 50 FR 46588 at 46593). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An analysis of the cost and benefits of this regulatuion, conducted under Executive Order 12291, was discussed in
the tentative final rule of November 8, 1985, (50 FR 46588). No comments were received in response to the agencies tentative
final rule, and the substances of that analysis has not changed. Executive Order 12291 has been superseded by Executive
Order 12866. FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified
in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive
Order and, thus, is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Although the final rule will result in the removal of some products from the OTC marketplace,
only a limited number of products are affected. These include: (1) All combination products containing quinine sulfate
and vitamin E, (2) products containing quinine sulfate alone labeled for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal
leg muscle cramps, (3) products containing vitamin E alone labeled with the same claim, and (4) any other products
marketed OTC for this claim. No further initial introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce
of any OTC drug product labeled for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps will be allowed
after the effective date of this final rule. Quinine is currently available as an OTC drug for treating chills and fever
of malaria. Based on an agency review of currently marketed products, it appears that approximately two-thirds of
these quinine-containing products are marketed for antimalarial use (with approximately one-third for the treatment
and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps). (OTC quinine drug products for antimalarial use will be discussed
in future issues of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) Vitamin E is currently available OTC for use as a vitamin. This final rule does not affect the continued marketing
and availability of products containing this vitamin provided the products are not labeled for the treatment and/or
prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. Products containing quinine sulfate and/or vitamin E may be relabeled
and reformulated where necessary (e.g., combination products) and remain in the marketplace with other allowed
claims, as described above. Accordingly, the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis
is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

Drug products containing active ingredients offered over-the-counter (OTC) for the treatment and/or prevention
of nocturnal leg muscle cramps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Quinine sulfate alone or in combination with vitamin E has been present in over-the-counter (OTC) drug products
for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps, i.e., a condition of localized pain in the lower
extremities usually occurring in middle life and beyond with no regular pattern concerning time or severity. There
is a lack of adequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness of quinine sulfate, vitamin
E, or any other ingredients for OTC use in the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. In the doses
used to treat or prevent this condition, quinine sulfate has caused adverse events such as transient visual and auditory
disturbances, dizziness, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Quinine sulfate may cause unpredictable serious
and life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions requiring medical intervention and hospitalization; fatalities
have been reported. The risk associated with use of quinine sulfate, in the absence of evidence of its effectiveness,
outweighs any potential benefit in treating and/or preventing this benign, self-limiting condition. Based upon
the adverse benefit-to-risk ratio, any drug product containing quinine or quinine sulfate cannot be considered
generally recognized as safe for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any OTC drug product that is labeled, represented, or promoted for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal
leg muscle cramps is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (the act), for which an approved application or abbreviated application under section 505 of the act and part 314
of this chapter is required for marketing. In the absence of an approved new drug application or abbreviated new drug
application, such product is also misbranded under section 502 of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Clinical investigations designed to obtain evidence that any drug product labeled, represented, or promoted
for OTC use for the treatment and/or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps is safe and effective for the purpose
intended must comply with the requirements and procedures governing the use of investigational new drugs set forth
in part 312 of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) After February 22, 1995, any such OTC drug product initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction
into interstate commerce that is not in compliance with this section is subject to regulatory action.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule executes a major revision of the rules for measurement of vessels using the Panama Canal effective October
1, 1994. The existing rules of measurement are replaced with a simplified, objective approach which brings the Commission's
system in line with an international practice which entered into full application worldwide on July 18, 1994. The
revised measurement rules apply a mathematical formula to the vessel's total volume to produce the basis for assessing
tolls. The tonnage values computed under the proposed system are comparable to those calculated under the Commission's
existing rules and, in the aggregate, are equal to existing tonnages. Accordingly, no changes are made to the rates
of toll for use of the Canal; however, certain administrative changes to the regulations dealing with Canal tolls
are necessary to ensure their consistency with the revised rules of measurement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 1604 of the Panama Canal Act of 1979, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 3794, and
in the regulations at 35 CFR part 70, on April 18, 1994, an advance notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 18332) recommending a complete revision to the Rules for Measurement of Vessels for the Panama Canal contained
in 35 CFR part 135. The change is designed to simplify the Commission's measurement procedures and bring measurement
rules at the Canal in line with the worldwide standard of tonnage measurement as contained in the 1969 International
Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships. At that time, a written analysis showing the basis and justification
for the proposed revision was made available to interested parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised 35 CFR part 135 provides for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Establishment of measurement rules for the Panama Canal Commission which are based on Annex 1 of the Convention;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Transitional relief measures for certain vessels, provided they do not have a structural change which results
in an alteration of 10 percent or more in their total volume; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Continued use of foreign tonnage authorities, and for acceptance of reasonably accurate volumes provided by them;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Correction of tonnage values as necessary to satisfy the Commission's desire for accuracy; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Calculation of volumes for vessels without an International Tonnage Certificate 1969 (ITC 69) through an alternative
tonnage estimating formula. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the changes to 35 CFR part 135, certain administrative changes to 35 CFR part 133 (Tolls for Use of Canal)
are required. These changes will reconcile the language of part 133 with the revised part 135 by allowing for the use

Written comments were solicited and received from interested parties, and a public hearing was held May 25, 1994 in
Washington, DC. The views presented by the interested parties were considered by the Board of Directors of the Panama
Canal Commission at its quarterly meeting of July 1994. On July 13, the Board agreed to recommend to the President the
revisions to the existing measurement system and the implementation of the Panama Canal Universal Measurement System
(PC/UMS). The proposed rule and recommendation to the President was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This part establishes the procedures for determining the Panama Canal Universal Measurement System (hereinafter
PC/UMS) Net Tonnage. The tonnage shall be used to assess tolls for use of the Panama Canal. Also, the tonnage may be used,
when adequate volume information is not provided, to assess the charge for admeasurement services.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All vessels except warships, floating drydocks, dredges, and vessels subject to transitional relief measures,
applying for passage through the Panama Canal shall present a duly authenticated International Tonnage Certificate
(1969) (hereinafter ITC 69), or suitable substitute (i.e., a certificate derived from a system which is substantially
similar to that which was provided for in the 1969 International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, and which
contains the total volume or allows for the direct mathematical determination of total volume). Vessels without
such total volume information shall be inspected by Canal authorities who shall determine an appropriate volume
for use in the calculation of a PC/UMS Net Tonnage of such vessels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The determination of total volume used in the calculation of PC/UMS Net Tonnage shall be carried out by the Panama
Canal Commission. In so doing, however, the Commission may rely upon total volume information provided by such officials
as are authorized by national governments to undertake surveys and issue national tonnage certificates. Total volume
information presented at the Panama Canal shall be subject to verification, and if necessary, correction insofar
as may be necessary to ensure accuracy to a degree acceptable to the Panama Canal Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Commission may, when it is deemed necessary to verify information contained on the ITC 69, require the submission
of additional documents. Failure to submit the requested documentation may result in the Commission's developing
a figure that accurately reflects the vessel's volume.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Upper Deck 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the uppermost complete deck exposed to weather and sea, which has permanent means of weathertight closing of
all openings in the weather part thereof, and below which all openings in the sides of the ship are fitted with permanent
means of watertight closing. In a ship having a stepped upper deck, the lowest line of the exposed deck and the continuation
of that line parallel to the upper part of the deck is taken as the upper deck.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Moulded Depth 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
means the vertical distance measured from the top of the keel to the underside of the upper deck at side. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In wood and composite ships the distance is measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet. Where the form at the
lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or where thick garboards are fitted, the distance is measured
from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In ships having rounded gunwales, the moulded depth shall be measured to the point of intersection of the moulded
lines of the deck and side shell plating, the lines extending as though the gunwales were of angular design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Where the upper deck is stepped and the raised part of the deck extends over the point at which the moulded depth is
to be determined, the moulded depth shall be measured to a line of reference extending from the lower part of the deck
along a line parallel with the raised part.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Enclosed spaces 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
mean all spaces which are bounded by the ship's hull, by fixed or portable partitions or bulkheads, by decks or coverings
other than permanent or movable awnings. No break in a deck, nor any opening in the ship's hull, in a deck or in a covering
of a space, or in the partitions or bulkheads of a space, nor the absence of a partition or bulkhead, shall preclude a
space from being included in the enclosed space.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Excluded spaces 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
mean, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, the spaces referred to in paragraphs (e)(1)
to (e)(5) of this section. Excluded spaces shall not be included in the volume of enclosed spaces, except that any such
space which fulfills at least one of the following three conditions shall be treated as an enclosed space:

(1)(i) A space within an erection opposite an end opening extending from deck to deck except for a curtain plate of a
depth not exceeding by more than 25 millimeters (one inch) the depth of the adjoining deck beams, such opening having
a breadth equal to or greater than 90 percent of the breadth of the deck at the line of the opening of the space. This provision
shall be applied so as to exclude from the enclosed spaces only the space between the actual end opening and a line drawn
parallel to the line or face of the opening at a distance from the opening equal to one-half of the width of the deck at
the line of the opening (Figure 1).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is issuing technical amendments to existing Appendix
B and is adding a new non-mandatory Appendix E to both 29 CFR 1910.120, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 29 CFR 1926.65, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The technical amendments to the Appendix B involve the updating of certain reference sources listed in Appendix
B to both 29 CFR 1910.120 and 1910.65. The new Appendix E provides suggested guidelines for a more effective training
curriculum and program. The mandatory requirements for those training programs are set forth in the main body of 29
CFR 1910.120 and 1926.65. The addition of a non-mandatory Appendix E to these sections will provide supplementary
information that can be used by employers for training program development directed toward training those employees
engaged in hazardous waste operations and emergency response activities within the scope of 29 CFR 1910.120 or 1926.65.

Regulatory history

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. On October 17, 1986, former President Reagan signed into law the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of
1986 (SARA) (Pub. L. 99&hyph;499). As part of SARA, the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) was directed to issue an
interim final rule within 60 days after the date of enactment of SARA, which was to provide not less protection for employees
engaged in covered hazardous waste operations than the protection contained in two specified documents. Those two
documents were the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ``Health and Safety Requirements for Employees Engaged
in Field Activities'' manual (EPA ORDER 1440.2), dated 1981, and the existing Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) standards under Subpart C or 29 CFR part 1926, OSHA's Construction Industry Safety and Health Standards. OSHA
published an interim final rule as directed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 19, 1986 (51 FR 45654). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In section 126 of SARA, the Congress also directed the Secretary to issue, within one year after the date of enactment
of SARA, a final standard under section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 for the health and safety
of employers engaged in hazardous waste operations and emergency response. SARA also indicated that certain specific
areas of employee protection, in particular employee training, were relevant to protect employees engaged in hazardous
waste operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA issued a proposed rule on hazardous waste operations and emergency including provisions for training on August
10, 1987 (52 FR 29620). Public hearings on the proposed rule were held during October 1987. As a result of that proposed
rule OSHA published a permanent final rule for hazardous waste operations and emergency response (HAZWOPER) on March
6, 1989 (54 FR 9294). That permanent final rule became effective on March 6, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In related action, on December 22, 1987, as part of an omnibus budget reconciliation bill (Pub. L. 100&hyph;202),
the language of SARA was amended. The amendment addressed section 126(d)(3) of SARA. Section 126(d)(3) of SARA reads
as follows before the amendment:

and supervisors have received the specified training and shall prohibit any individual who has not received the specified
training from engaging in hazardous water operations covered by the standard.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment to section 126(d)(3) contained in Pub. L. 100-202 added the following language to the end of paragraph
(d)(3):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
That section 126(d)(3) of SARA is amended by adding a new sentence at the end thereof as follows: The certification
procedures shall be no less comprehensive than those adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency in its Model
Accreditation Plan for Asbestos Abatement Training as required under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act
of 1986.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the amendment, OSHA on January 26, 1990, issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) (55 FR 2776) addressing
the accreditation of training programs for hazardous waste operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since January, 1990, OSHA has been working to develop a final rule addressing the accreditation of certain training
programs required in 29 CFR 1910.120 and 29 CFR 1926.65. OSHA will complete shortly action on that final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 30, 1992, OSHA republished 29 CFR 1910.120 in 29 CFR Part 1926 as 1926.65 at the request of the OSHA Advisory Committee
on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH). This republication codified most of the requirements affecting construction
activities in one part of the CFR for the convenience of construction industry employers and employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most recent action on this rule concerns the development of the non-mandatory appendix to be added as Appendix
E to 1910.120. This action took place during the September 30, 1993 meeting of ACCSH held in Washington, DC. As part
of the Advisory Committee's action, a work group chaired by Mr. John Moran, Director of Safety and Health for the Laborers'
Health and Safety Fund made specific recommendations to the full advisory committee concerning OSHA's proposed
29 CFR 1910.121 rulemaking. The first recommendation of the work group was, ``that OSHA promptly issue a non-mandatory
appendix to 1910.120, establishing minimum training curriculum guidelines and minimum training provider guidelines
(ACCSH Tr. pg. 148, lines 22&hyph;25).'' Mr. Moran made a formal motion that the ACCSH recommend, ``the prompt issuance
of a non-mandatory appendix to 1910.120 which contains guidelines for minimum training curriculum, and that minimum
training provider requirements to meet the training standards established in 120 (ACCSH Tr. pg. 152, lines 5&hyph;10).''
The motion was passed unanimously (ACCSH Tr. pg. 159, lines 3&hyph;11). The formal report containing the recommendations
developed by the work group was presented to the Assistant Secretary by the ACCSH on October 1, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The report included a December, 1991 document titled, ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum Criteria for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Training Grant Technical Workshop on Training
Quality developed the document during a technical workshop on training quality. The workshop, ``Minimum Criteria
for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response was held March 22&hyph;24,
1990 in Washington, DC and was sponsored by NIEHS. Approximately 60 individuals from labor, industry and the government,
including representatives from OSHA participated in the workshop.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The report recommends that,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA should promptly issue a non-mandatory appendix to 29 CFR 1910.120 which provides guidelines as to minimum training
curriculum and training provider requirements for those training activities mandated by the 1910.120 standard.
It is our recommendation that this appendix be essentially the NIEHS National Technical Workshop consensus document
referred to in the BACKGROUND above and which is appended to this report.&blank;

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ACCSH recommendation to the Assistant Secretary suggested that the non-mandatory appendix address two topics.
First, ACCSH recommended that the appendix should provide guidelines as to the minimum training curriculum for those
training activities mandated by 1910.120. Second, ACCSH recommended that the appendix should provide guidelines
as to the minimum training provider requirements for those training activities mandated by 1910.120.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Non-mandatory Appendix E on Training
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Separate from the ACCSH recommendations, several individuals suggested that during the interim period prior to
issuing a final rule on training accreditation, OSHA should add a non-mandatory appendix to 29 CFR 1910.120 and 29
CFR 1926.65 that would provide guidance to employers for developing effective training programs. The training provisions
of these two standards are stated in performance oriented language in paragraph (e) for hazardous waste site workers,
in paragraph (p)(7) for treatment, storage, and disposal facility workers, and in paragraph (q)(6) for emergency
response workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA uses non-mandatory appendices for a number of purposes such as to provide non-regulatory guidance to employees
and employers for the purpose of complying with various OSHA regulations or to assist them in developing more effective
safety and health operations. They may also be an amplification of interpretive information that is included in the
preamble discussions of rulemakings when they are published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is often brought to OSHA's attention that the useful interpretive information included in preamble discussions
addressing OSHA's standards becomes less accessible when rules and regulations are published later in the Code of
Federal Regulations. It has been suggested that having the most important of this type of information available in
the same publication as the codified text of a rule would make compliance decision making in the workplace easier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also non-mandatory appendices provide a non-regulatory mechanism to keep employer and employee populations aware
of new technical information that becomes available to the agency subsequent to the issuance of a standard. These
new technologies and new types of information may be of assistance to employer and employee populations in complying
with the regulatory text to which the appendix is attached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training provider criteria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. OSHA has reviewed the training provider criteria suggested in the ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum Criteria for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' OSHA is considering fully the issue in the final rule on certification of training programs. Consequently there
is no need to insert a non-mandatory appendix on this subject. In the interim, OSHA believes that the standard provides
sufficient guidance on the qualifications of instructors and that additional information in an appendix format
is unnecessary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Training curriculum guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The document that the ACCSH recommended that OSHA use as the training guidelines to be placed in the non-mandatory
appendix is titled, ``

Minimum Criteria for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' It was developed to report the results of a technical workshop on training quality held March 22&hyph;24, 1990
in Washington, DC. The meeting was sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIEHS employee training program grantees identified a need to establish criteria for determining the quality of
employee health and safety training programs. This was believed by the workshop to be especially critical for meeting
the training requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rule for hazardous waste
operations and emergency response (29 CFR 1910.120). The NIEHS employee training program grantees planned a workshop
to identify, evaluate, discuss and make recommendations on training quality issues in this area. A planning committee
met twice to develop a draft discussion document for the workshop's deliberations. The workshop brought together
representatives from each of the NIEHS grantees, and invited experts from management, labor, academia, and government.
A balance of such representations was sought for each of the workshop's five sub-sessions. The sub-sessions topics
included the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. General Criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. General hazardous waste operations and site-specific training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. RCRA-treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Emergency response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Guidelines for accreditation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the closing plenary, a draft final report from the workshop was sent out for a review by participants. Comments offered
during the closing plenary and for a period after the meeting were received and included as appropriate in the final
document. The report represents the views of the technical experts rather than an official position by any agency,
including NIEHS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIEHS is authorized under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) to award grants to nonprofit
organizations that demonstrate experience in implementing and operating employee health and safety training and
education programs and that demonstrate the ability to reach and involve in training programs target populations
ow employees who are or will be engaged in hazardous materials waste removal, containment, or emergency response
operations. The grantees who attended the conference met the requirements of and participation in the NIEHS program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has reviewed the guidelines. Overall they would lead to a highly effective training program. Following them
would certainly meet the training requirements of 1910.120 and 1926.65 as a general matter. The detailed guidance
they present would be helpful to trainers and employers and would lead to better training of employees. Accordingly
OSHA is publishing them as a non-mandatory Appendix E to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the legal requirements are set forth in the body of the standards. These require site-specific elements
that of course can not be covered in general guidelines. In addition, some of the guidelines go beyond the clear requirements
of the regulatory text in paragraphs (a) to (q). In those cases, employers would only be cited if the employee's training
did not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (q). Accordingly, Appendix E is not called ``minimum criteria''
as ACCSH entitled them. In addition, there are other training curriculum resources available that can provide additional
guidance to individuals preparing training programs. Therefore, these appendices are not only based upon the NIEHS
document but also upon other training program guidance documents. OSHA has utilized documents developed by the National
Fire Protection Association, the International Association of Fire Service Instructors, and others to supplement
the guidance provided in the NIEHS document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Technical Amendments to Appendix B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It has been brought to the attention of OSHA that certain references made to National Fire Protection Association
standards in Appendix B to 1910.120 and 1926.65 are outdated. OSHA makes reference to NFPA 1991, NFPA 1992, and NFPA
1993 as standards that were under development at the time 29 CFR 1910.120 was published. These references are outdated
because the NFPA standards referred to in the existing text are no longer ``under development'' but were published
in 1990 as voluntary consensus standards by NFPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to Appendix B of 1910.120 and Appendix B of 1926.65 that are contained in this notice recognize the adoption
of these NFPA standards. The revisions correct editorially the text of these appendices to recognize the current
status of the referenced NFPA standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document makes technical amendments and adds a non-mandatory appendix for informational purposes that do not
change regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the agency finds that notice and comments are unnecessary pursuant
to the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and according to OSHA procedural rules in 29 CFR 1911.5.

Since this is a non-mandatory appendix and therefore not an enforceable standard, OSHA recommends that those employers,
employees or volunteers in public sector emergency response organizations outside Federal OSHA jurisdiction consider
the following criteria in developing their own training programs. A unified approach to training at the community
level between emergency response organizations covered by Federal OSHA and those not covered directly by Federal
OSHA can help ensure an effective community response to the release or potential release of hazardous substances
in the community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. General considerations

Incident commander
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incident commander is the individual who, at any one time, is responsible for and in control of the response effort.
This individual is the person responsible for the direction and coordination of the response effort. An incident
commander's position should be occupied by the most senior, appropriately trained individual present at the response
site. Yet, as necessary and appropriate by the level of response provided, the position may be occupied by many individuals
during a particular response as the need for greater authority, responsibility, or training increases. It is possible
for the first responder at the awareness level to assume the duties of incident commander until a more senior and appropriately
trained individual arrives at the response site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, any emergency responder expected to perform as an incident commander should be trained to fulfill the
obligations of the position at the level of response they will be providing including the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Ability to analyze a hazardous substance incident to determine the magnitude of the response problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Ability to plan and implement an appropriate response plan within the capabilities of available personnel and
equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Ability to implement a response to favorably change the outcome of the incident in a manner consistent with the
local emergency response plan and the organization's standard operating procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Ability to evaluate the progress of the emergency response to ensure that the response objectives are being met
safely, effectively, and efficiently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Ability to adjust the response plan to the conditions of the response and to notify higher levels of response when
required by the changes to the response plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal OSHA standards in 29 CFR 1926.65(q) are directed toward private sector emergency responders. Therefore,
the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix are directed toward that employee population. However, they
also impact indirectly through State OSHA or USEPA regulations some public sector emergency responders. Therefore,
the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix may be applied to both employee populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with OSHA state plans must cover their employees with regulations at least as effective as the Federal OSHA
standards. Public employees in states without approved state OSHA programs covering hazardous waste operations
and emergency response are covered by the U.S. EPA under 40 CFR 311, a regulation virtually identical to 1926.65.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this is a non-mandatory appendix and therefore not an enforceable standard, OSHA recommends that those employers,
employees or volunteers in public sector emergency response organizations outside Federal OSHA jurisdiction consider
the following criteria in developing their own training programs. A unified approach to training at the community
level between emergency response organizations covered by Federal OSHA and those not covered directly by Federal
OSHA can help ensure an effective community response to the release or potential release of hazardous substances
in the community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. General considerations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emergency response organizations are required to consider the topics listed in 1926.65(q)(6). Emergency response
organizations may use some or all of the following topics to supplement those mandatory topics when developing their
response training programs. Many of the topics would require an interaction between the response provider and the
individuals responsible for the site where the response would be expected.

Incident commander
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incident commander is the individual who, at any one time, is responsible for and in control of the response effort.
This individual is the person responsible for the direction and coordination of the response effort. An incident
commander's position should be occupied by the most senior, appropriately trained individual present at the response
site. Yet, as necessary and appropriate by the level of response provided, the position may be occupied by many individuals
during a particular response as the need for greater authority, responsibility, or training increases. It is possible
for the first responder at the awareness level to assume the duties of incident commander until a more senior and appropriately
trained individual arrives at the response site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, any emergency responder expected to perform as an incident commander should be trained to fulfill the
obligations of the position at the level of response they will be providing including the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Ability to analyze a hazardous substance incident to determine the magnitude of the response problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Ability to plan and implement an appropriate response plan within the capabilities of available personnel and
equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Ability to implement a response to favorably change the outcome of the incident in a manner consistent with the
local emergency response plan and the organization's standard operating procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Ability to evaluate the progress of the emergency response to ensure that the response objectives are being met
safely, effectively, and efficiently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Ability to adjust the response plan to the conditions of the response and to notify higher levels of response when
required by the changes to the response plan.
