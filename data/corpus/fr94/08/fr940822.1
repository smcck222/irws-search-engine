SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains a proposed regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment regarding payments with respect to internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revenue taxes and internal revenue stamps by check or money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order. Changes to the applicable tax law were made by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tax Reform Act of 1984 (TRA). These amendments, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to conform the regulations to the change in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute, apply to persons making payments with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal revenue taxes or stamps by check or money order, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to financial institutions that issue or guarantee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment of checks or money orders.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice of proposed rulemaking contains proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to &sect;301.6311&hyph;1, to reflect amendments made to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 6311 by section 448(a) of the Tax Reform Act of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1984, Pub. L. 98&hyph;369 (TRA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6311(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the IRS may receive for internal revenue taxes, or in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment for internal revenue stamps, checks or money orders, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the extent and under the conditions specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. If money orders or certain kinds of checks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tendered in payment are not duly paid, then section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6311(b)(2) provides the United States with a lien against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all the assets of the drawee or issuer for the amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
check or money order. Before its amendment, this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied, in the case of checks, only with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified, treasurer's, or cashier's checks drawn on a bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or trust company. Section 448(a) of TRA expanded section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6311(b)(2) to include guaranteed drafts drawn on financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions other than banks and trust companies. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments to the regulations reflect these changes in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute and permit payment by guaranteed draft in any case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which the regulations under prior law permitted payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by certified, treasurer's, or cashier's check. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations provide a definition of ``financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution.'' Since the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Firearms now has its own separate regulations governing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of payment for certain taxes by check or money 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order, which appear in 27 CFR, provisions of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations referring to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Firearms have been removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in EO 12866. Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to these regulations, and, therefore, an initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their impact on small business.

Comments on Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, consideration will be given to any written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments (a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for public inspection and copying. A public hearing may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduled if requested in writing by a person that timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submits written comments. If a public hearing is scheduled, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of the date, time and place for the hearing will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing that nonconformance penalties (NCPs) be made available for specific emission standards taking
effect in the 1996 and 1998 model years. In general, the availability of NCPs allows a manufacturer of heavy-duty engines
(HDEs) or heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) (which include heavy light-duty trucks) whose engines or vehicles fail to conform
with certain applicable emission standards, but do not exceed a designated upper limit, to be issued a certificate
of conformity upon payment of a monetary penalty. The specific emission standards for which NCPs have been considered
in this rulemaking are the 1996 and later model year Tier 1 standards for heavy light-duty trucks, the 1996 and later
model year Particulate Matter (PM) standard for urban bus applications, and the 1998 and later model year heavy-duty
diesel engine oxides of nitrogen (NO

) standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to offer NCPs for the 1996 and later model year particulate matter (PM) standard of 0.10 g/mile for
Light Duty Trucks 3 (LDT3) at full useful life. EPA has considered, but is not proposing to offer NCPs for the other standards.
The proposed upper limit associated with the LDT3 PM standard is the previous diesel-fueled LDT3 vehicle standard
of 0.13 g/mi.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 206(g) of the Clean Air Act (the Act), 42 U.S.C. 7525(g), requires EPA to issue a certificate of conformity
for HDEs or HDVs which exceed an applicable section 202(a) emissions standard, but do not exceed an upper limit associated
with that standard, if the manufacturer pays an NCP established by rulemaking. Congress adopted section 206(g) in
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 as a response to perceived problems with technology-forcing heavy-duty emissions
standards. (It should be noted, however, that the existence of NCPs does not change the criteria under which the standards
have been and will be set under section 202.) Following

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ruckelshaus,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 478 F.2d 615 (D.C. Cir. 1973), Congress realized the dilemma that technology-forcing standards were likely to cause.
If strict standards were maintained, then some manufacturers, ``technological laggards,'' might be unable to comply
initially and would be forced out of the marketplace. NCPs were intended to remedy this potential problem. The laggards
would have a temporary alternative that would permit them to sell their engines or vehicles by payment of a penalty.
At the same time, conforming manufacturers would not suffer an economic disadvantage compared to nonconforming
manufacturers, because the NCP would be based, in part, on money saved by the technological laggard and its customer
from the nonconforming engine or vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 206(g)(1), NCPs may be offered for HDVs or HDEs. The penalty may vary by pollutant and by class or category
of vehicle or engine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HDVs are defined by section 202(b)(3)(C) as vehicles in excess of 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR).
The light-duty truck (LDT) classification includes trucks that have a GVWR of 8500 lbs or less. Therefore, certain
LDTs may be classified as HDVs. Historically, LDTs up through 6000 lbs GVWR have been considered ``light light-duty
trucks'' (LLDTs) and LDTs between 6,001 and 8,500 pounds GVWR have been considered ``heavy light-duty trucks'' (HLDTs).
Based on various new requirements established by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, each of these two light truck
categories has been further subdivided into groups by weight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LLDTs are classified by weight based on ``loaded vehicle weight,'' or LVW, which maintains its current definition:
curb weight plus 300 lbs. The trucks up through 3750 lbs LVW make up a subclass called light-duty-trucks-1, or LDT1.
Those greater than 3750 lbs LVW but less than or equal to 6000 lbs GVWR are the subclass light-duty-trucks-2, or LDT2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HLDTs are divided at 5750 lbs ``adjusted loaded vehicle weight,'' or ALVW. Adjusted loaded vehicle weight is the
average of the curb weight and the GVWR. The HLDTs that are up through 5750 lbs ALVW are called light-duty trucks-3,
or LDT3. Those above 5750 lbs ALVW but less than or equal to 8500 lbs GVWR are light-duty-trucks-4, or LDT4. The LDT3
and LDT4 subclasses make up the HLDT vehicle class. Since NCPs are only offered for heavy duty vehicles or engines,
this notice addresses only emission standards for light duty trucks of the LDT3 and LDT4 categories.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 206(g)(3) requires that NCPs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Account for the degree of emission nonconformity;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Increase periodically to provide incentive for nonconforming manufacturers to achieve the emission standards;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Remove the competitive disadvantage to conforming manufacturers.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 206(g) authorizes EPA to require testing of production vehicles or engines in order to determine the emission
level on which the penalty is based. If the emission level of a vehicle or engine exceeds an upper limit of nonconformity
established by EPA through regulation, the vehicle or engine would not qualify for an NCP under section 206(g) and
no certificate of conformity could be issued to the manufacturer. If the emission level is below the upper limit but
above the standard, that emission level becomes the ``compliance level,'' which is also the benchmark for warranty
and recall liability; the manufacturer who elects to pay the NCP is liable for vehicles or engines that exceed the compliance
level in-use, unless, for the case of HLDTs, the compliance level is below the in-use standard. The manufacturer does
not have in-use warranty or recall liability for emissions levels above the standard but below the compliance level.

A. Review of NCP Eligibility Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The generic NCP rule (Phase I) established three basic criteria for determining the eligibility of emission standards
for nonconformance penalties in any given model year. See 40 CFR 1103&hyph;87. First, the emission standard in question
must become more difficult to meet. This can occur in two ways, either by the emission standard itself becoming more
stringent, or due to its interaction with another emission standard that has become more stringent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, substantial work must be required in order to meet the emission standard. EPA considers ``substantial work''
to mean the application of technology not previously used in that vehicle or engine class/subclass, or a significant
modification of existing technology, in order to bring that vehicle/engine into compliance. EPA does not consider
minor modifications or calibration changes to be classified as substantial work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, a technological laggard must be likely to develop. A technological laggard is defined as a manufacturer who
cannot meet a particular emission standard due to technological (not economic) difficulties and who, in the absence
of NCPs, might be forced from the marketplace. EPA will make the determination that a technological laggard is likely
to develop, based in large part on the above two criteria. However, these criteria are not always sufficient to determine
the likelihood of the development of a technological laggard. An emission standard may become more difficult to meet
and substantial work may be required for compliance, but if that work merely involves transfer of well-developed
technology from another vehicle class, it is unlikely that a technological laggard would develop.

B. Phase II NCPs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The above criteria were used to determine eligibility for NCPs during Phase II of the NCP rulemaking (50 FR 53454, December
31, 1985). NCPs were offered for the following 1987 and 1988 model year standards: the particulate matter (PM) standard
for 1987 diesel-fueled light-duty trucks with loaded vehicle weight in excess of 3750 pounds (LDDT2s), the 1987 gasoline-fueled
light HDE (LHDGE) HC and CO emission standards, the 1988 diesel-fueled HDE (HDDE) PM standard, and the 1988 HDDE NO

C. Phase III NCPs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The availability of NCPs for 1991 model year HDE standards was addressed during Phase III of the NCP rulemaking (55
FR 46622, November 5, 1990). NCPs were offered for the following: the 1991 HDDE PM standard for petroleum-fueled urban
buses, the 1991 HDDE PM standard for petroleum-fueled vehicles other than urban buses, the 1991 petroleum-fueled
HDDE NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard, and the PM emission standard for 1991 and later model year petroleum-fueled light-duty diesel trucks greater
than 3750 lbs loaded vehicle weight (LDDT2s). As discussed in the Phase III preamble, NCPs were also considered but
not offered for the methanol-fueled heavy-duty diesel engine and heavy-duty gasoline engine standards as it was
concluded that those standards did not meet the eligibility criteria established in the generic rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Phase III of the NCP rulemaking described how NCPs would be integrated into the HDE NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and PM averaging program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Phase IV NCPs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The availability of NCPs for HDVs and HDEs subject to the 1994 and later model year emission standards for particulate
matter (PM) was addressed by Phase IV of the NCP rulemaking (58 FR 68532, December 28, 1993). NCPs were offered for the
following: the 1994 and later model year PM standard for heavy-duty diesel engines (HDDEs) used in urban buses, and
the 1994 and later model year PM standard for HDDEs used in vehicles other than urban buses. NCPs were also considered,
but not offered for the 1994 and later model year methanol-fueled HDE PM standard and the 1994 and later model year cold
carbon monoxide (CO) standard for heavy light-duty gasoline fueled trucks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NCPs were not considered for the Tier 1 ``in-use'' standards since NCPs are a mechanism to allow manufacturers to certify
engine families, not to assist manufacturers in complying with ``in-use'' standards. The remainder of this proposal
addresses whether NCPs should be made available for the 1996 Urban Bus PM standard of 0.05 g/BHP-hr, the 1998 HDE NO

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since there is no NMHC standard for earlier model year LDT3s, the new NMHC standard represents an increase in stringency
over the THC standard for previous model years, satisfying the first eligibility criterion. EPA acknowledges that
one manufacturer has indicated that it may have difficulty complying with this standard. Based on the manufacturer's
planned strategy, however, EPA does not believe that substantial work, as described above, will be necessary to meet
the new standard for either the intermediate useful-life level of 0.32 g/mi or the full useful-life level of 0.46 g/mi,
since it does not represent a major modification of existing technology. EPA also does not believe that a technological
laggard is likely to develop, based on discussions with vehicle manufacturers. For these reasons, EPA is not proposing
to offer NCPs for this standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that the new CO standard of 6.4 g/mi at full useful life represents an increase in stringency over the
prior standard of 10 g/mi at full useful life for LDT3s, satisfying the first eligibility criterion. Based on 1993
model year certification levels, only one manufacturer is currently producing LDT3 vehicles which would not meet
the new standard at full useful life. Since this manufacturer does not anticipate difficulty in meeting the new CO
standards, EPA does not believe that a technological laggard is likely to develop. The half useful-life standard
of 4.4 g/mi is considered by EPA and manufacturers to be less difficult to meet compared with the full useful life standard.
For these reasons, EPA is not proposing to offer NCPs for these standards.

new standard, and EPA does not believe that a technological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laggard is likely to develop among manufacturers of that group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The half useful-life standard for non-diesel vehicles of 0.70

to meet compared with the full useful life standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the case of diesel-fueled LDT3s, however, EPA believes

the increased stringency is likely to require substantial work to

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no previous PM standard for non-diesel-fueled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LDT3s. Since it is well-recognized in the industry that non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diesel fueled vehicles emit very low levels of particulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matter, no work should be required by manufacturers to meet this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new standard and no technological laggard should develop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA is not proposing to offer NCPs for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that the new PM standard of 0.10 g/mi at full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life represents an increase in stringency over the prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of 0.13 g/mi at full useful life for diesel-fueled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LDT3s, satisfying the first eligibility criterion. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussions with current manufacturers, at least one manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is adapting technology from similar engines, but having different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service requirements. Significant work will probably be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the technology adaptation specified by that manufacturer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially when considering the interrelationship of the NO

believes that a technological laggard may develop because of the

amount of work involved. For these reasons, EPA is proposing to

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is no NMHC standard for earlier model year LDT4s. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both EPA and vehicle manufacturers believe that the NMHC standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represents an increase in stringency over the THC standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous model year LDT4s, satisfying the first eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion. The same manufacturer that expressed concern in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting the NMHC standard for LDT3 has similar concerns in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting this standard and will use a similar strategy to lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the emissions. For the same reasons stated in the above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of the NMHC standard for LDT3s, EPA does not propose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to offer NCPs for the NMHC standard at either the intermediate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that the new CO standard of 7.3 g/mi at full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life represents an increase in stringency over the prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of 10 g/mi at full useful life for LDT4s, satisfying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first eligibility criterion. Based on discussions with current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers of affected vehicles, EPA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers will not have difficulty in meeting the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. Since there are no 1993 model year LDT4s with CO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification levels higher than the new standard at full useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life, EPA does not believe that a technological laggard is likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to develop. The half useful-life standard of 5.0 g/mi is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally considered by EPA and manufacturers to be less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to meet compared with the full useful life standard of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7.3 g/mi. For these reasons, EPA is not proposing to offer NCPs

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior standard of 1.7 g/mi at full useful life for LDT4s, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfying the first eligibility criterion. Based on discussions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with current manufacturers of affected vehicles, and based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact that there were no model year 1993 LDT4s certified which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would exceed the new standard at full useful life, EPA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that substantial work, as described above, will not be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of manufacturers and that a technological laggard is not likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to develop. The half useful-life standard for non-diesel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles of 1.10 g/mi is generally considered by EPA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers to be less difficult to meet compared with the full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA recognizes that the new PM standard of 0.12 g/mi at full

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard of 0.13 g/mi at full useful life for LDT4s, satisfying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first eligibility criterion. As in the case of non-diesel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LDT3s, no work should be required to meet the new PM standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-diesel LDT4s. And based on discussions with current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers of diesel-fueled LDT4 vehicles and on 1993 model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year certification levels, EPA does not believe that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technological laggard is likely to develop or that substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work, as described above, will be required to meet the new PM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. For these reasons, EPA is not proposing to offer NCPs

i. 1996 HDDE Urban Bus PM Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1996 HDDE urban bus PM standard of 0.05 g/BHP-hr is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent than the previous 1994 0.07 g/BHP-hr PM standard it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
superseding. EPA recognizes that some work may be necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the urban bus engine manufacturers to comply with the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. Based on discussions with those manufacturers, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not believe that a technological laggard is likely to exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reinforcing that belief is the fact that the 0.05 g/BHP-hr 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard was originally proposed as a 1994 standard. Detroit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Diesel Corporation successfully argued that they could not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively comply by 1994, and that if the 0.05 g/BHP-hr 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard was delayed until 1996, and a standard of 0.07 g/BHP-hr 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was adopted in 1994, compliance could be achieved more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiently. Furthermore, compliance with the 0.05 g/BHP-hr 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard has been demonstrated in certification using a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particulate trap system. And a catalyst equipped 1994 urban bus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine tested as low as 0.05 g/bhp-hr, although it certified to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.07 g/bhp-hr. For these reasons, EPA is not proposing to offer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCPs for the 1996 0.05 g/BHP-hr PM standard for HDDE used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urban buses.

 standard of 4.0 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g/BHP-hr is an increase in stringency over the present 5.0 g/BHP-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hr standard. EPA also believes, based on discussions with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current manufacturers of HDEs, that additional work will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to comply with the new standard. Improvements to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turbochargers, conversion of remaining mechanical fuel injection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems to electronic control, and, in some cases, the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust gas catalytic converters will be necessary. But, based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on those same discussions with manufacturers, and considering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact that the standard does not become effective for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional four years from this time, EPA believes that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technological laggard is not likely to develop. Therefore, EPA

The values of the compliance parameters are based on the cost of projected engine modifications and the use of an oxidation
catalyst for PM reduction as outlined in ``Calculation of Nonconformance Penalty Rates for 1996 and Later Model Year
LDT3 Particulate Matter (PM) Standards''. While the possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of complying with the PM standard using a particulate trap exists, it is not considered by EPA or industry to be a likely
solution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a previous PM standard of 0.13 g/mi exists, EPA is proposing that the upper limit which cannot be exceeded by LDT3
vehicles shall be 0.13 g/mi.

IV. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant''
and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines ``significant
regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100
million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal
governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned
by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs
or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. This regulation will not have an annual effect on the economy in
excess of $100 million and will not cause a major increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price of HDEs above those that would otherwise occur from compliance with the emission standards themselves. This
regulation is intended to assist manufacturers that are having difficulty developing and marketing vehicles which
comply with the 1996 Tier 1 PM standard for LDT3s. Without this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, a manufacturer experiencing difficulty in complying with this new emission standard (after the use of credits)
has only two alternatives: fix the nonconforming engines for the associated model years or not sell them at all. NCPs
provide manufacturers with additional time to bring their engines into conformity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, NCPs are calculated to deprive nonconforming manufacturers of any cost savings and competitive advantages
stemming from marketing a nonconforming engine. Thus, NCPs will not have significant adverse effects on competition,
employment, investment, productivity, innovation or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete
with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Economic Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the use of NCPs is optional, manufacturers have the flexibility and will likely choose whether or not to use
NCPs based on their ability to comply with emissions standards. If no HDE manufacturer elects to use NCPs, these manufacturers
and the users of their products will not incur any additional costs related to NCPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCPs remedy the potential problem of having a manufacturer forced out of the marketplace due to that manufacturer's
inability to conform to new, strict emission standards in a timely manner. Without NCPs, a manufacturer which has
difficulty certifying HDEs in conformance with emission standards or whose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engines fail a SEA has only two alternatives: fix the nonconforming engines, perhaps at a prohibitive cost, or prevent
their introduction into commerce. The availability of NCPs provides manufacturers with a third alternative: continue
production and introduce into commerce upon payment of a penalty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an engine that exceeds the standard until an emission conformance technique is developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, NCPs represent a regulatory mechanism that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allows affected manufacturers to have increased flexibility. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision to use NCPs may be a manufacturer's only way to continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to introduce HDEs into commerce. Hence, NCPs may be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to have no adverse economic impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When evaluating the environmental impact of this proposed rule, one must keep in mind that, under the Act, NCPs are
a consequence of enacting new, more stringent emissions requirements for heavy duty engines. Emission standards
are set at a level that most, but not necessarily all, manufacturers can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve by the model year in which the standard becomes effective. Following 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
International Harvester
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ruckelshaus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 478 F.2d 615 (D.C. Cir. 1973), Congress realized the dilemma that technology-forcing standards were likely to cause,
and allowed manufacturers of heavy-duty engines to certify nonconforming vehicles/engines upon the payment of
an NCP, under certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. This mechanism would allow manufacturer(s) who cannot meet technology-forcing standards immediately
to continue to manufacture these nonconforming engines while they tackle the technological problems associated
with meeting new emission standard(s). Thus, as part of the statutory structure to force technological improvements
without driving manufacturers out of the market, NCPs provide flexibility that fosters long-term emissions improvement
through the setting of lower emission standards at an earlier date than could otherwise be possible. By design, NCPs
encourage the technological laggard that is using NCPs to reduce emission levels to the more stringent standard as
quickly as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Compliance With Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. None of the affected manufacturers
could be classified as small. Moreover, as already discussed, the NCP program can be expected to benefit manufacturers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some small entities do exist as manufacturers' contractors for the testing of engines for Production Compliance
Audits (PCAs). It is EPA's practice to conduct PCA scheduling (namely, tests per day limitations) in such a way as to
consider the staff and manpower capabilities of such contractors and avoid any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems. The result is that these entities are not adversely affected. Thus, I certify that this proposed rule will
not have any adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Information Collection Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule requires that manufacturers perform certain record keeping and submit certain reports to EPA.
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 USC 3501, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, provides that reporting and record keeping requirements be approved by OMB before they can be enforced by EPA. The
information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been addressed in previous rulemaking and approved
by OMB (OMB control no. 2060&hyph;0132). At the time of the final rulemaking the Agency will submit an Inventory Correction
Worksheet to OMB amending the approved burden hours to reflect the additional reports required by this rulemaking.
However, any person wishing to comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these requirements is invited to do so. Comments on these requirements should be submitted to Chief, Information
Policy Branch, 2136, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460 and to OMB, Office
of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 726 Jackson Place, NW, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer
for EPA.'' The final rule will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
for the chemical substance described as modified propylene glycol ether, which is the subject of premanufacture
notice (PMN) P&hyph;93&hyph;507. This proposal would require certain persons who intend to manufacture, import,
or process this substance for a significant new use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing
or processing activities for a use designated by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice would provide
EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before
it can occur.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed SNUR would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import,
or processing of the substance identified as modified propylene glycol ether for the significant new uses described
herein. The required notice would provide EPA with information with which to evaluate an intended use and associated

I. Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant
new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed
in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B)
of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical
substance for that use. Section 26(c) of TSCA authorizes EPA to take action under section 5(a)(2) with respect to a
category of chemical substances. Persons subject to this SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and
EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of premanufacture notices under section 5(a)(1) of TSCA. In particular,
these requirements include the information submission requirements of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions
authorized by section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3), and (h)(5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives
a significant new use notice (SNUN), EPA may take regulatory action under section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the
activities for which it has received a SNUN. If EPA does not take action, section 5(g) of TSCA requires EPA to explain
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its reasons for not taking action. Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are
subject to the export notification provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b)
appear at 40 CFR part 707.

II. Applicability of General Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs are codified at 40 CFR part 721, subpart A. Regulatory provisions
covering user fees applicable to significant new use notices are codified at 40 CFR part 700 under the authority of
TSCA section 26(b). Interested persons may refer to these sections for further information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to establish significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for the chemical dipropylene glycol
dimethyl ether. The proposed SNUR designates as significant new uses: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any manner or method of manufacturing, importing, or processing associated with any use of the substance without
the use of dermal protection, including gloves, that provides an impervious barrier to the substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Annual manufacture and importation volume for any use greater than 4 times the yearly volume specified in the PMN
for the substance (annual production total must include quantities manufactured for export and for all domestic
uses).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Use of the substance in a consumer product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 2, 1993, EPA received a PMN, designated as P&hyph;93&hyph;507, for a modified propylene glycol ether.
Based on test data on the PMN substance, submitted with the PMN and during the review period, EPA has concerns for the
substance's potential to cause adverse systemic, maternal, and fetal effects. The greatest potential for risk appears
to be associated with the dermal route of exposure. The extent to which the Agency expects that adverse effects may
occur relates in large part to the isomer mix of the PMN substance, which is a combination of three individual isomers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the ratio of these isomers in the PMN substance is maintained at certain levels, the Agency considers the potential
risk to workers during manufacturing, processing, and use to be reasonable; however, if the formulation contains
a high percentage of an isomer for which the suspected human health hazard is significant, the Agency might consider
the risk to workers to be unreasonable. Although the Agency does not consider the higher risk formulations likely
to be made, and is reasonably confident that the isomer of greatest potential concern will be present at low levels
(&lt;5 percent) in the formulation, the PMN submitter was not able to specify with certainty the percentage at which
each isomer would be present in the PMN substance. Consequently, there is potential for the PMN substance to be formulated
in isomer ratios that may present an unreasonable risk to human health as described above. In deciding not to regulate
the PMN submitter through an administrative consent order, the Agency balanced the potential risks from certain
isomer formulations with the benefits to worker safety offered by the PMN substance as a substitute for more potentially
hazardous glycol ethers. Another factor in the Agency's decision not to regulate the PMN substance through an order
was the product stewardship program that the submitter had established for the substance, which included up-front
glove testing to ensure that accurate information on dermal protection would be communicated to workers exposed
to the substance. The results of the glove testing indicated that permeation at rates that might present an unreasonable
risk could occur with certain glove models. The Agency considers it prudent and necessary, therefore, that any glove
or dermal protective clothing intended for use in handling the PMN substance be tested, or the specifications from
the manufacturer or supplier evaluated, prior to use. This testing or evaluation must ensure that the protective
item will be impervious to the PMN substance for the expected duration and conditions of exposure, which includes
the likely combinations of other chemicals to which the item may be exposed in the work area. (Each piece of personal
protective equipment must be selected and used in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.132 and 1910.133.) Handling the PMN
substance without the use of equipment that provides an impervious barrier to it would be considered a significant
new use requiring Agency notice and appropriate justification. Based in part on the submitter's commitment to incorporate
the results of the glove study in its product literature, the Agency considered regulation of the submitter to require
use of dermal protective equipment under a consent order unnecessary, especially in view of the substance's relative
human health advantages. The balance in favor of non-regulation might shift, however, if aspects of the manufacture
and use of the PMN substance were to change from those on which the Agency's risk assessment was originally based. The
production volume estimated by the submitter in its PMN, for example, is expected to result in relatively few workers
being exposed to the PMN substance. If the production level were to increase substantially, however, the number of
workers and the duration of exposure_especially during manufacture_would increase proportionately. As a consequence,
EPA would need to revisit its original risk assessment, consider whether a potential unreasonable risk might result
at the higher production levels and whether to regulate to mitigate that risk. Of course, if this increase in production
volume were coupled with formulation of the PMN substance with a proportionally greater amount of the isomers of concern,
the potential risk to workers would increase as well. The filing of a SNUN based on production volume would afford the
Agency an opportunity to evaluate not only the increased worker exposures and risks, but also the risks associated
with a particular isomer formulation of the PMN substance, the knowledge of which would be based on actual production
experience. For purposes of determining the annual PMN production volume and compliance with the volume limitation,
quantities of the PMN substance manufactured for both domestic use and export should be totaled (i.e. considered
in aggregate), even if the export volumes were formerly manufactured ``for export only.'' Once domestic manufacture
is intended or commences, all volumes produced_both for domestic consumption and export_are subject to PMN reporting
requirements and TSCA section 5 regulation. Also, the annual production total should reflect manufacture or import
volumes for any and all uses; the total should not be calculated on a per-use-basis. (See 40 CFR 720.45 and associated
Agency guidance documents and instructions.) In addition, while the potential risk to workers from exposure to the
PMN substance might be considered reasonable, similar exposures and risks to the general population by way of consumer
uses for the PMN substance might not. The Agency considers potential risks to workers to be mitigated in part by the
greater level of protective measures normally found in the workplace and the generally greater awareness among workers
of the potential hazards associated with the substances they handle. Consumers, on the other hand, usually are not
as aware of potential hazards, do not have access to the same types of information and protections available to workers,
and therefore are potentially at greater risk if exposed to a hazardous new substance in a consumer product. Thus,
in an effort to prevent an unreasonable risk to the general population, the PMN substance cannot be manufactured or
processed for a consumer use until that use and the potential exposures and risks associated with it have been reviewed
and evaluated by the Agency. In summary, for the reasons described above, the Agency has designated handling the PMN
substance without adequate dermal protection, production volume when it reaches a substantial level per year, and
any consumer use of the PMN substance as significant new uses.

IV. Applicability of SNUR to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final SNUR 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as
of the date of proposal rather than as of the effective date of the rule. If uses which had commenced between that date
and the effective date of this rulemaking were considered ongoing, rather than new, any person could defeat the SNUR
by initiating a significant new use before the effective date. This would make it difficult for EPA to establish SNUR
notice requirements. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance for
uses regulated under this SNUR after the date of this proposed rule will have to cease any such activity before the effective
date of the rule. To resume their activities, such persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements
and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires. EPA, not wishing to unnecessarily disrupt
the activities of persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of a significant new use before
the effective date of the SNUR, has promulgated provisions to allow such persons to comply with this proposed SNUR
before it is promulgated. If a person were to meet the conditions of advance compliance as codified at &sect;721.45(h),
the person would be considered to have met the requirements of the final SNUR for those activities. If persons who begin
commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance between proposal and the effective date of the SNUR
do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they must cease that activity before the effective date of the rule.
To resume their activities, these persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait
until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires.

basic information considered by the Agency in developing this proposed rule. EPA will supplement the record with
additional information as it is received. EPA will accept additional materials for inclusion in the record at any
time between this proposal and designation of the complete record. EPA will identify the complete rulemaking record
by the date of promulgation. A public version of the record, without any CBI, is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential
Information Center (NCIC) from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The TSCA Nonconfidential
Information Center is located in Rm. NE&hyph;B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC.

VIII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this proposed rule is not ``significant'' and
is therefore not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this proposed rule would not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affected
by this proposed rule would likely be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUNs for this substance.
Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by the proposed rule would not be substantial,
even if all of the SNUN submitters were small firms. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule under the provisions of
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and has assigned OMB control number 2070&hyph;0012. Public reporting burden for this collection of information
is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response, with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing
and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this
collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch
(2131), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The
final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information requirements contained in this proposal.

Technical information or comments are requested on the proposed base (100-year) flood elevations and proposed base
(100-year) flood elevation modifications for the communities listed below. The base (100-year) flood elevations
and modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required either to adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or remain qualified for
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Emergency Management Agency proposes to make determinations of base flood elevations and modified base
flood elevations for each community listed below, in accordance with Section 110 of the Flood Disaster Protection
Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed base flood and modified base flood elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria
required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must
change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community
may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State,
or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP
and are also used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations
are made final, and for the contents in these buildings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration.
No environmental impact assessment has been prepared.

Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this proposed rule is exempt from the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because proposed or modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and are required to establish and maintain community eligibility in the NFIP.
No regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is to inform the public that the U.S. Fish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wildlife Service (Service) is proposing in this notice to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditionally approve bismuth-tin shot as nontoxic for waterfowl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and coot hunting during the 1994&hyph;95 waterfowl hunting season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Available information and data from studies indicate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bismuth-tin shot is nontoxic to migratory waterfowl if ingested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further studies will be required to confirm these preliminary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service is proposing on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim basis to conditionally approve the use of bismuth-tin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shot (in a mixture of [nominally] 97&hyph;3 percents, respectively) as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nontoxic for the taking of waterfowl and coots during the 1994&hyph;95 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hunting season. This proposed action responds to a petition for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking by the Bismuth Cartridge Company, dated June 14, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and received by the Service on June 24, 1994. Specifically, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition requests that the Service modify the provisions of 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR, section 20.21(j), to make legal the use of bismuth-tin shot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on an interim, conditional basis for the 1994&hyph;95 and the 1995&hyph;96 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seasons. The Bismuth Cartridge Company petition acknowledges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for completion of the nontoxic shot approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures studies outlined in 50 CFR, 20.134, before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final approval is considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petition for rulemaking cites as reasons in support of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposal the following: a) bismuth is nontoxic; b) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule is conditional; and c) the evidence presented in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the record, i.e., the application from the Bismuth Cartridge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition for rulemaking follows two applications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final approval, one dated October 21, 1993, and the other dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 30, 1993, that were provided to the Service. In reply, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Service responded that the applications were deficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the bismuth-based shot material expected to be loaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into shotshells had not been found through preliminary testing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be nontoxic. Preliminary toxicity testing by the applicants had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been with (essentially) pure bismuth only. Thus, there was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(either available or provided with the application) adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific data covering toxicity of the material to be loaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into shotshells. However, the Service pledged in both replies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work with the applicants to process the applications in as timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a fashion as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the mid-1970s, the Service has sought to identify shot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that when spent does not pose a significant hazard to migratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
birds and other wildlife. Ingestion of spent lead shot has long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been identified as a source of significant mortality in migratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
birds. The Service first addressed the issue of lead poisoning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in waterfowl in a 1976 environmental impact statement (EIS), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
later readdressed the issue in a 1986 supplemental EIS. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
latter provided the scientific justification for the ban on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of lead shot for hunting waterfowl and coots that was begun 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1986 and completed in 1991. Currently, only steel shot has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been approved by the Service Director as nontoxic. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service believes that there may be other suitable candidate shot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials available which could be approved for use as nontoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shot. The Service is anxious to consider these other potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
candidates for approval as nontoxic, and does not feel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constrained to limit nontoxic shot options.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation relative to use of nontoxic shot and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concomitant endorsement by the Service of steel shot has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated some controversy. Some hunters still believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steel shot is less ballistically efficient than lead and can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage shotgun barrels, although the Service believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of hunters have accepted steel as an effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative to lead. However, resistance to the use of steel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shot is undoubtedly creating an unknown level of noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the requirement to use nontoxic shot for waterfowl and coot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hunting. The availability of an alternative to steel shot will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the public greater choice during an interim period and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thus, could improve hunter compliance with nontoxic shot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in waterfowl hunting situations. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased hunter use of this alternative shot could benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upland game bird habitats, and upland game birds as well, through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the diminished use of lead shot in those areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is proposing this conditional, interim approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the basis of what is known about the toxicity of bismuth and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tin, principally the former because it makes up almost all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the shot. However, test results with tin include those by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grandy et al. (1968) in which there were no deaths associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with mallards dosed with tin shot. For bismuth, there are three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially recent and relevant studies that support this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a 30-day acute toxicity study now being completed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bismuth-tin shot, Sanderson et al. (1994) report no mortality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with dosage of mallard ducks. Although the dosage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase and preliminary analyses have been completed, concluding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tissue examination and analyses remain to be carried out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, this concluding work will be completed before any final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking; when reviewing the preliminary results, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doubtful that any dramatically different findings are yet to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sanderson et al. (1992), over the course of a 30-day acute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity study on captive-reared mallards with three different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shot-types, i.e., lead, essentially pure bismuth and iron shot, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found no mortality associated with bismuth. Further, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations on the absorption of bismuth based on estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excreted quantities, with known amounts in blood, liver, bone and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
muscle (a range of none to minute amounts) suggest that most of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bismuth eroded from the shot as a result of gizzard action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was excreted in the feces. Sanderson et al. (1992) state that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``All nine ducks (three control, three Bi8 and three Fe8) examined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the end of the study had normal amounts of muscle and abundant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fat depots. Internal organs were within normal limits. No 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant differences were observed among the three groups of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ducks.'' (Numbers behind symbols refer to dosage rates, i.e., 8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bismuth and 8 iron shot, which is the maximum number of the range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the experimental design.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ringelman et al. (1992) conducted a 32-day acute toxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study which involved dosing game-farm mallards with a shot alloy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of tungsten-bismuth-tin (TBT), which was 39, 44.5 and 16.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent by weight, respectively. No dosed birds died during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trial, and behavior was normal. Examination of tissues post-euthanization revealed no toxicity or damage related
to shot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. Blood calcium differences between dosed and undosed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
birds were judged to be unrelated to shot exposure. Although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bismuth concentrations in kidney and liver were near detectable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits, they did not differ between dosed and undosed birds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This study concluded that ``...TBT shot presents virtually no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for acute intoxication in mallards under the conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this study.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sanderson et al. (1992) have reviewed the relevant, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mostly earlier, literature with regard to the toxicity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bismuth. This literature provides little in the way of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparison to the results of the types of toxicity studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the Service and cited here. However, this literature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides findings which tend not to create a concern for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential metallic bismuth-related intoxication in waterfowl when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingested. Although there have been some human neurological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems reported that are related to chronic use of organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bismuth compounds, bismuth (especially metallic) is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered a serious industrial hazard to humans. A common use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of bismuth is in pharmaceuticals for stomach ailments; bismuth is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the principal active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The studies cited here for support of the application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent only the first of a series of three toxicity tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 50 CFR 20.134, before a final approval can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given to the applicant by the Director of the Service. The other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two toxicity tests required are for: (1) long-term chronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure; and (2) reproduction. The Service believes it has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient flexibility in the regulations to approach final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval in a step manner. That is, acute toxicity tests and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other toxicity information suggest that a 1-year conditional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval can be provided without significant risk to migratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bird resources. If indicated, second and third 1-year approvals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be provided until the series of toxicity tests are completed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at which time, final approval may be made. This series of tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to be completed before the Service would consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final approval of bismuth-tin shot as nontoxic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bismuth-tin shot is currently approved by the Canadian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wildlife Service for use in nontoxic shot zones on a conditional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis under terms similar to those described above. Bismuth-tin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shot is also used in several European countries, and elsewhere in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the world.

In summary, this rule proposes to conditionally approve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of bismuth-tin shot for waterfowl and coot hunting for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994&hyph;95 season. The applicants, who wish to obtain final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval for their shot as nontoxic, would be required to obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
season-by-season approval until they have successfully completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of the tests in the testing procedures required by 50 CFR, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 20.134.

National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1500&hyph;1508), the Service will comply

Endangered Species Act Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543; 87 Stat. 884), provides that, ``The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall review other programs administered by him and utilize such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs in furtherance of the purposes of this Act'' (and) shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out .&blank;.&blank;. is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangered species or threatened species or result in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destruction or adverse modification of [critical] habitat .&blank;.&blank;.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the Service will initiate Section 7 consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Endangered Species Act for this proposed rulemaking to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legalize, on an interim and conditional basis, the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bismuth-tin shot for hunting waterfowl and coots during the 1994- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95 seasons. When completed, the results of the Service's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspected by the public in, and will be available to the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from, the Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservation

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seq.) requires the preparation of flexibility analyses for rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that will have a significant effect on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities, which includes small businesses, organizations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or governmental jurisdictions. However, the Service has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that this rule will have no effect on small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since the shot to be approved will merely supplement nontoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shot already in commerce and available throughout the retail and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wholesale distribution systems. No dislocation or other local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects, with regard to hunters and others, are apt to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidenced. This rule was not subject to Office of Management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget (OMB) review under Executive Order 12866. This rule does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not contain any information collection efforts requiring approval

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations regarding decommissioning of licensed
facilities to provide specific radiological criteria for the decommissioning of lands and structures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed criteria would apply to the decommissioning of all licensed facilities and facilities subject to the
Commission's jurisdiction. The Commission expects to apply these criteria in determining the adequacy of remediation
of residual radioactivity resulting from the possession or use of source, byproduct, and special nuclear material.
For high-level and low-level waste disposal facilities, the criteria would apply only to ancillary surface facilities
that support radioactive waste disposal activities because criteria for closure of the remainder of the facility
and termination of the license are currently specified. For uranium mills, the criteria apply to decommissioning
of the facility but not to soil cleanup and the disposal of uranium mill tailings. The criteria would apply to decommissioning
of nuclear facilities that operate through their normal lifetime, as well as to those that may be shut down prematurely.
However, they would not apply to sites already covered by a decommissioning plan approved by the Commission before
the effective date of this rule, if it is adopted in final form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of this rulemaking is to provide a clear and consistent regulatory basis for determining the extent to which
lands and structures must be remediated before a site can be considered decommissioned. The Commission believes
that inclusion of criteria in the regulations would result in more efficient and consistent licensing actions related
to the numerous and frequently complex site remediation and decommissioning activities anticipated in the future.
The Commission has reassessed the basis for the residual contamination levels contained in existing guidance in
light of changes in basic radiation protection standards, improvements in remediation and radiation detection
technologies, decommissioning experience obtained during the past 15 years, and comments received from workshops
held as part of this rulemaking effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC presently allows decommissioning on a site-specific basis using existing guidance. However, the Commission
believes that codifying radiological criteria for decommissioning in the regulations would allow the NRC to more
effectively carry out its function of protecting public health and the environment at decommissioned sites by providing
for more efficient use of NRC and licensee resources, consistent application across all types of licenses, and a predictable
basis for decommissioning planning. In addition it would eliminate protracted delays in decommissioning which
result as licensees wait for NRC to promulgate regulatory criteria before proceeding with decommissioning of their
facilities.

Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is proposing to amend 10 CFR Part 20 of its regulations to provide specific radiological
criteria for the decommissioning of lands and structures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC is using an enhanced participatory process for developing the criteria. This process included a series of
seven workshops held from January through May 1993. The workshops were conducted at a very early stage of rulemaking
to enhance participation of interested parties and the public with the following objectives: (a) To ensure that the
relevant issues have been identified; (b) to exchange information on these issues; and (c) to identify underlying
concerns and areas of disagreement, and, where possible, approaches for resolution. In July 1993, the NRC staff also
conducted eight scoping meetings for the development of the Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) supporting
the rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed criteria would apply to the decommissioning of all facilities licensed under 10 CFR Parts 30, 40, 50,
60, 61, 70, and 72, as well as other facilities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under the Atomic Energy Act
of 1954, as amended, (AEA) and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. The Commission would apply these criteria in
situations where remediation of radioactive material residues resulting from use or possession of Source, Byproduct,
and Special Nuclear Material is undertaken. For high-level and low-level waste disposal facilities (10 CFR Parts
60 and 61), the criteria would apply only to ancillary surface facilities that support radioactive waste disposal
activities because criteria for closure of the remainder of the facility and termination of the license are specified
in 10 CFR Parts 60 and 61. For uranium mills, the criteria would apply to decommissioning of the facility but not to soil
cleanup or the disposal of uranium mill tailings, which is covered in Appendix A of 10 CFR Part 40 and Environmental
Protection Agency standards in 40 CFR Part 192. The criteria would apply to decommissioning of nuclear facilities
that operate through their normal lifetime, as well as to those that may be shut down prematurely. However, they would
not apply to sites currently covered by a decommissioning plan approved by the Commission before the effective date
of this rule, if it is adopted as a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the rulemaking is to ensure that decommissioning will be carried out without undue impact on public
and occupational health and safety and the environment. The proposed amendments enhance the existing regulatory
framework by providing a clear and consistent regulatory basis for determining the extent to which lands and structures
must be remediated before a site can be decommissioned. The Commission believes that inclusion of criteria in the
regulations would result in more efficient and consistent licensing actions related to the numerous and frequently
complex site decontamination and decommissioning activities anticipated in the future. The Commission has developed
the basis for the residual contamination levels in light of changes in basic radiation protection standards, improvements
in remediation and radiation detection technologies, decommissioning experience obtained during the past 15 years,
and comments received from workshops held as part of this rulemaking effort.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has the statutory responsibility for protection of health and safety and
the environment related to the possession and use of source, byproduct, and special nuclear material under the AEA.
One part of NRC's responsibility is to ensure safe and timely decommissioning of the nuclear facilities that it licenses
and to provide guidance to licensees on how to plan for and prepare their sites for decommissioning. Decommissioning,
as previously defined by the NRC, means to remove nuclear facilities safely from service and to reduce residual radioactivity
to a level that permits release of the property for unrestricted use and termination of the license.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the AEA and Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the statutory responsibility
to establish generally applicable standards for protection of the public from radioactive material (i.e., outside
the NRC licensees site boundaries). The NRC is responsible for ensuring, through licensing requirements and other
restrictions, that activities at facilities under NRC jurisdiction do not lead to radiation doses outside the facility
boundaries that exceed EPA's generally applicable standards. For this reason, NRC has been coordinating closely
with EPA in the development of the proposed decommissioning standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by NRC and EPA in March 1992 provides a basic framework within which NRC
and EPA will endeavor to resolve issues of concern relating to the regulation of radionuclides in the environment.
Under the guidelines of the MOU, EPA will make a determination as to whether the proposed decommissioning standards
provide a sufficient level of protection for public health and safety and the environment. If EPA concludes that the
NRC standards are sufficient, EPA will publish its findings in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for notice and comment and propose that NRC licensees be exempt from the standards developed by EPA for non-NRC licensed
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decommissioning activities are initiated when a licensee decides to terminate licensed activities. Decommissioning
activities do not include the removal and disposal of spent fuel, which is considered to be an operational activity
or the removal and disposal of nonradioactive structures and materials beyond that necessary to terminate the NRC
license. Disposal of nonradioactive hazardous waste not necessary for NRC license termination is not covered by
these regulations but would be treated by other appropriate agencies having responsibility over these wastes. If
nuclear facilities are to be reused for nuclear purposes, applications for license renewal or amendment, or for a
new license are to be submitted according to the appropriate existing regulation. Reuse of a nuclear facility for
other nuclear purposes is not considered decommissioning because the facility remains under license. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After licensed activities have ceased, licensees are required to decommission their facilities so that their licenses
can be terminated. At present, this requires that radioactivity in land, groundwater, surface water, buildings,
and equipment resulting from the licensed operation be reduced to levels that allow the property to be released for
unrestricted use. Licensees must then demonstrate that all facilities have been properly decontaminated and that,
except for any residual radiological contamination found to be acceptable to remain at the site, radioactive material
has been transferred to authorized recipients. Confirmatory surveys are conducted by NRC, where appropriate, to
verify that sites meet NRC radiological criteria for decommissioning.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are currently about 22,000 licensees in the United States. About one-third of these are NRC licensees, while
the remainder are licensed by Agreement States through agreements entered into under Section 274 of the AEA. Licensees
include utilities, nuclear fuel fabricators, universities, medical institutions, radioactive source manufacturers,
and companies that use radioisotopes for industrial purposes. About 75 percent of NRC's 6,700 materials licensees
use either sealed radioactive sources or small amounts of short-lived radioactive materials. Sealed sources, including
items such as check sources, do not pose a contamination problem unless the encapsulation is broken. Decommissioning
of these facilities is typically simple because there is usually little or no residual radioactive contamination
to be removed and disposed of. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the remaining 25 percent, certain types of facilities (e.g., radioactive source manufacturers, radiopharmaceutical
producers, and radioactive ore processors) conduct operations which could produce substantial radioactive contamination
in portions of the facilities. At these sites, lands, facilities, or equipment may become contaminated through the
use of radioactive material in forms which have not been encapsulated to prevent the spread or dispersal of material.
When radioactive material in unsealed forms is used, such as in the nuclear fuel fabrication industry, in production
of radiopharmaceutical medicines, or in research, the equipment used to process and handle the material becomes
contaminated by the small quantities of material that adhere to surfaces of valves, piping, etc. If material is spilled,
then the area of the spill becomes contaminated. These facilities will have to be decontaminated to acceptable levels
before they can be released for unrestricted use and their licenses terminated. The population of nuclear fuel cycle
facilities which will require decommissioning includes approximately 100 nuclear power plants (at 70 sites); 50
non-power (research and test) reactors; 10 major fuel facilities (fuel fabrication and uranium hexafluoride production
plants); 50 uranium mills; and 10 independent spent fuel storage installations. It is estimated that about 1,800
other NRC-licensed facilities could require significant remediation as part of decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Essentially everything that comes in contact with radioactive material must be considered contaminated and checked
for the presence of residual radioactive material. Areas surrounding facilities could become contaminated by the
movement of materials, equipment, and people into and out of the areas containing the radioactive material. NRC requires
that contamination control procedures be used to minimize or prevent the movement of radioactive materials into
other areas. Nevertheless, some areas may become contaminated over the course of time due to breakdowns in the control
procedures. Contamination may also be spread by the movement of water or other fluids containing the radioactive
materials through or along piping, equipment, walls, floors, sumps, drains, etc. In some cases, this has resulted
in the release of significant quantities of radioactive material into the ground under or around buildings and facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to contamination, some licensed operations can produce radioactive materials through the process of
activation. In this process, materials become radioactive when they are bombarded by neutrons generated in certain
nuclear operations. Examples of such operations include nuclear reactors, where metal reinforcing bars in concrete
surrounding the reactor vessel may become radioactive through neutron bombardment. These activated materials
may also need to be removed or disposed of during decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several hundred NRC and Agreement State licenses are terminated each year. The majority of these licenses involve
limited operations, produce little or no radioactive contamination, and do not present complex decommissioning
problems or potential risks to public health or the environment from residual contamination. However, as the nuclear
industry matures, it is expected that more and more of the larger nuclear facilities that have been operating for a
number of years will reach the end of their useful lives and have to be decommissioned. Thus, both the number and complexity
of facilities that will require decommissioning are expected to increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC has a program underway to effect timely decommissioning of about 50 sites, which warrant special NRC oversight
either because they have not been decommissioned properly in the past or have been engaged in the decommissioning
process for an extended period. The Commission has established a Site Decommissioning Management Plan (SDMP), NUREG&hyph;1444,
October 1993) for effecting timely decommissioning of these problem facilities. Sites being handled under the SDMP
vary in degree of radiologic hazard, cleanup complexity, and cost. Some sites comprise tens of acres that require
assessment for radiological contamination, whereas other sites have contamination known to be limited to individual
buildings or discrete piles of tailings or contaminated soil. Many sites involve active licenses, but some sites
involve formerly licensed sites, or sites where the responsible party is unable or unwilling to perform cleanup.
These sites also vary in degree of completion of decommissioning. At some sites, little or no decontamination work
has been done; whereas at other sites, decommissioning is underway or license termination is in the offing.

The effort to have these SDMP sites remediated and decommissioned has been hampered in part because licensees view
the absence of definitive radiological criteria as an incentive to defer decommissioning pending issuance of formal
NRC requirements. The General Accounting Office (GAO), which has been critical of the Commission's inability to
effect timely decommissioning of these sites, has recommended that the NRC enhance its decommissioning efforts
by reconsidering its radiological criteria for decommissioning.

Until new criteria are in place, the Commission intends to proceed with decommissioning nuclear facilities on a site-specific
basis considering existing criteria coupled with the concept that residual radioactivity be as low as is reasonably
achievable (ALARA). Case and activity-specific decisions concerning decommissioning of sites will continue to
be made as necessary during the pendency of this rulemaking process. Because the SDMP sites could pose unnecessary
environmental and public risks or financial burdens if they are not decommissioned in a timely manner, the Commission's
effort to effect timely decommissioning of these sites has been proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 13, 1993, (58 FR 4099). The NRC published an Action Plan to ensure timely remediation of sites listed in the
SDMP in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13389). The NRC does not intend to require additional remediation of sites in response to criteria
established in this rulemaking, provided that the licensee or responsible party has already remediated the site
or was in the process of remediating the site in full accordance with an NRC-approved decommissioning plan at the time
of promulgation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internationally, most efforts have been focused upon development of criteria for waste disposal and recycle of radioactively
contaminated materials using guidance published by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Decommissioning criteria
have generally been established on a case-specific basis. This approach is the same as the current approach employed
in the United States pending the development of radiological criteria through formal requirements. The NRC staff
is not aware of other international efforts similar to this rulemaking to define radiological criteria for decommissioning.

The Enhanced Participatory Rulemaking Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The normal pattern for NRC rulemaking is the development of a proposed rule by the NRC staff for Commission consideration,
publication of the proposed rule for public comment, consideration of the comments by the NRC staff, and preparation
of a final rule, as appropriate, for Commission approval. As directed and approved by the Commission, the NRC staff
has enhanced participation in the early stages of this rulemaking process through a series of workshops for affected
interests. These workshops were held from January through May 1993 in Chicago, IL; San Francisco, CA; Boston, MA;
Dallas, TX; Philadelphia, PA; Atlanta, GA; and Washington, DC. The workshops elicited informed discussions of options
and approaches for developing radiological criteria, and the rationale for options and approaches. While these
workshops were not designed to seek ``consensus'' in the sense that there is agreement on how each issue should be resolved,
the workshops were conducted at a very early stage of rulemaking to enhance participation of interested parties and
the public with the following objectives: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) To ensure that the relevant issues have been identified; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To exchange information on these issues; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) To identify underlying concerns and areas of disagreement, and, where possible, approaches for resolution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission hopes that the interactions among the participants in the workshop environment also fostered a clearer
mutual understanding of the positions and concerns of all participants. These workshops provided a number of themes,
such as consideration of restricted use options, increased public participation in the site decommissioning process,
and a desire to return sites to levels indistinguishable from natural background, that form the basis upon which the
Commission has developed the provisions of this rulemaking. Comments made at these ``Scoping Meetings,'' the workshops,
and related written comments were considered by the NRC staff in its preparation of a staff draft rule as described
in the paragraph below. Comments were also used, as appropriate, in developing the Draft Generic Environmental Impact
Statement (GEIS) for the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission approved an additional opportunity for enhanced participation at an early stage of the rule development.
Copies of the NRC staff's draft rule and summaries of comments received from workshop participants, NUREG/CR&hyph;6156,
were sent to NRC Agreement States, workshop participants, and other interested parties on January 27, 1994. A notice
of availability of these documents was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and the documents were placed on the electronic bulletin board on February 2, 1994 (59 FR 4868). The intent of this
informal comment period in advance of a proposed rule was to provide an opportunity for interested parties to comment
on the adequacy of the draft criteria and the extent to which the criteria have considered the range of viewpoints expressed
during the workshops and scoping meetings. The comment period ended on March 11, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concurrent with the NRC rulemaking on radiological criteria for decommissioning, the EPA is proceeding to develop
standards and guidance for Federal agencies in the area of radiation protection, including standards for the cleanup
of contaminated sites. The EPA National Advisory Council on Environmental Policy and Technology and the Subcommittee
on Residual Radioactivity held public meetings in October 1993, February 1994, and May 1994 to discuss the issues
associated with the EPA rulemaking. The NRC and EPA have coordinated their efforts in this area in order to ensure that
effective and consistent site cleanup standards are established while minimizing duplication of effort. Accordingly,
the EPA was an important participant in the NRC rulemaking workshops and is a cooperating agency in the preparation
of the GEIS for the rulemaking. The NRC has also consulted extensively with EPA throughout the rulemaking process.
It is anticipated that the information gathered during the workshops on the NRC standards will also be relevant and
useful to the EPA efforts in the area of site cleanup standards. The objective of the NRC and EPA cooperative efforts
is to attempt to reach an agreement that the NRC standards established in the enhanced participatory rulemaking are
sufficient to provide adequate protection to the public health and safety for NRC-licensed sites. The EPA efforts
could then focus on the site clean-up standards for non-NRC licensed sites, such as DOE and DOD facilities. This is
consistent with the principles and procedures set forth in a Memorandum of Understanding between the NRC and EPA published
on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54127), to guide each agency's actions in areas of mutual regulatory concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The next two sections of this notice summarize the comments from the workshops and the comments on the NRC staff draft
rule. The purpose of these summaries is to document the public comments and the NRC response to these comments, and
to show how the NRC approach to the rulemaking has evolved as a result of public participation in the rulemaking process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over 7,000 comments were presented at the seven Workshops, eight scoping meetings, and in related letters. The NRC
staff considered these comments in the development of the NRC staff's draft rule which was sent to NRC Agreement States,
workshop participants, and other interested parties on January 27, 1994. Comments were also used, as appropriate,
in developing the Draft GEIS for the rule.

NRC held rulemaking workshops in Chicago, IL; San Francisco, CA; Boston, MA; Dallas, TX; Philadelphia, PA; Atlanta,
GA; and Washington, DC between January and May 1993. The workshop comments have been summarized in NUREG/CR&hyph;6156,
``Summary of Comments Received from Workshops on Radiation Criteria for Decommissioning.'' This report summarizes
3,635 comments categorized from transcripts of the seven workshops and 1,677 comments from 100 NRC docketed letters
from individuals and organizations. NUREG/CR&hyph;6156 merely catalogues the comments and viewpoints; no analysis
or response to the comments is included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments reflect a broad spectrum of viewpoints on the issues related to radiological criteria for decommissioning
and associated subjects. The comments show little evidence of general agreement on issues except that most parties
appear to agree that (1) the rulemaking should proceed and (2) the Commission's activities in decommissioning should
recognize that it is not reasonable to expect all nuclear facilities to be remediated to a level that permits termination
of the license and release of the facility for unrestricted use. While a number of additional themes emerged from the
workshops, these themes cannot be characterized as having the general agreement of all of the workshop and meeting
participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transcripts of the workshops and scoping meetings and copies of related letters are available for inspection or copying
for a fee in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW (Lower Level), Washington, DC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC also held public meetings on the scope of the GEIS during July 1993 in Washington, DC; San Francisco, CA; Oklahoma
City, OK; and Cleveland, OH. Comments from these meetings were reviewed and comments which differed substantially
from those from the workshops are also summarized in the body of NUREG/CR&hyph;6156. A summary of all of the comments
from the GEIS scoping meetings is included as Appendix E to the GEIS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Almost all commenters supported the NRC's plans to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiological decommissioning standards and recommended that the rulemaking go forward expeditiously. Some commenters
recommended that the NRC consider and possibly establish both radiological and chemical decommissioning standards.
Most commenters stated that the NRC should establish standards for both unrestricted and restricted release of sites.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC is proceeding with a rulemaking which will establish radiological criteria for decommissioning. NRC's schedule
calls for issuance of a final rule by May 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC's authority is limited by law primarily to ensuring protection of the public health and safety from radiological
and nuclear hazards associated with source, special nuclear, and byproduct material. NRC has refrained from extending
its reach to address non-radiological hazards except where specifically authorized by Congress (e.g., uranium
mill tailings) or where these hazards would not otherwise be adequately controlled because of a regulatory void.
Consequently, NRC is not proposing to include provisions in the radiological criteria to address non-radiological
hazards. Although the rule would not establish criteria for disposition of nonradioactive hazardous and other wastes,
licensees are reminded that they must continue to meet applicable Federal, State, and local standards for disposition
of these wastes. The proposed rule provides for both unrestricted release and restricted termination of the license.
If a licensee cannot satisfy the conditions for license termination, the license will not be terminated.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters recommended that NRC decommissioning standards be based on and be consistent with the scientific
information and advice of such organizations as the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP)
and the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). One commenter suggested that the NRC should
determine whether the standards are to be technologically-based or politically-based; if the latter, do not waste
time on technological input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It should be noted that the NRC and its predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, have generally followed
the basic radiation protection recommendations of the ICRP; its U.S. counterpart, the NCRP; and the EPA Draft Federal
Radiation Protection Guidance for Exposure to the General public in formulating basic radiation protection standards.
Recommendations of the ICRP and the NCRP were relied on in the revised ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation,''
which was published May 21, 1991 (56 FR 233360), and implemented by licensees on or before January 1, 1994. The proposed
radiological criteria for decommissioning continues this practice but the proposed rule also recognizes the public's
interest in and potential for contributing to the decommissioning process. The public's involvement through participating
in the development of the criteria in this rulemaking, opportunities for review of decommissioning plans, as well
as through participation on Site-Specific Advisory Boards as specified in this rule are expected to aid in the conduct
of a decommissioning program that is understandable, technologically sound, and responsive to the concerns of affected
parties.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters recommended that the NRC consider adopting a risk limit standard equating to a radiation dose
of 25 to 100 millirem per year. According to two commenters, a 100 millirem per year limit would increase the cancer
risk in the population only slightly above its normal incidence rate. One commenter believes that radiation damage
per unit of exposure may increase at smaller doses. Other commenters stated that there may be a threshold for radiation
effects and that there may be no adverse health effects at low radiation levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Supplementary Information for the revised ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation,'' the NRC stated
that the standards are based upon the assumptions that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Within the range of exposure conditions usually encountered in radiation work, there is a linear relationship,
without threshold, between dose and probability of occurrence of stochastic (random) health effects such as latent
cancer and genetic effects; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The severity of each type of stochastic health effect is independent of dose; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Nonstochastic (nonrandom) radiation-induced health effects can be prevented by limiting exposures so that
doses are below the thresholds for their induction.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the absence of convincing evidence that there is a dose threshold or that low levels of radiation are beneficial,
the staff believes that the assumptions regarding a linear nonthreshold dose-effect model for cancers and genetic
effects and the existence of thresholds only for certain nonstochastic effects are prudent for formulating radiation
protection standards and planning radiation protection programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff believes the dose limits and ALARA requirements of the proposed radiological criteria for decommissioning
provide a reasonable basis for protection of public health and safety and the environment. However, the staff has
also determined that decommissioning activities should not be allowed the entire dose limit of 100 mrem/y for members
of the public. The staff has selected a value which is a relatively small fraction of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit, consistent with other decisions of both the EPA and NRC for unrestricted access to areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters recommended that the NRC establish a risk/dose limit on the order of the variability of natural background
radiation occurring across the United States as its decommissioning standard. The reasons given were that no health
risks are attributable to background radiation variations and studies show that there is no increase in cancer incidence
over a wide range of background radiation in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff believes that the overall objective for decommissioning should be the return of the facility to levels
approximating background. However, the NRC staff recognizes that demonstrating that radioisotope levels at a site
are indistinguishable from background will be a complex task involving sophisticated sampling, measuring, and
statistical analysis techniques. The NRC staff also recognizes that the difficulty of the task can vary substantially
depending on a number of factors including the radionuclide in question, the background level for that and other radionuclides
at the site, and the temporal and spatial variations in background radiation at the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in the draft rule, the NRC staff proposed as a goal of the ALARA process that the Total Effective Dose Equivalent
(TEDE) to the average member of the Critical Group from all radionuclides that could contribute to residual radioactivity
and are distinguishable from background not exceed 3 mrem (0.03 mSv) per year. Demonstration of achieving this dose
criterion would be considered as the only demonstration necessary to meet the proposed ALARA requirements of the
rule. One of the reasons 3 millirem per year was selected is because variations of this magnitude typically are not
distinguishable from the variation of dose from background radiation. Three mrem/y is well within the variability
of natural background radiation across the U.S. and also within those variations experienced seasonally at particular
sites. Based upon comments received on the NRC staff draft, the Commission has decided to remove the 3 millirem per
year value from the proposed rule (see discussion under ``Comments on NRC Staff Draft'').

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments were made concerning how risk standards should be applied to the population who may be exposed to
residual radioactivity at a released site. Most commenters favored applying a risk limit to individuals and believed
it unnecessary to specify a collective dose limit (i.e., a limit on the cumulative dose in person-rem/y to the entire
exposed population). One commenter remarked that if collective dose is used, it should be applied in a comprehensive
manner. For example, in evaluating an appropriate cleanup standard, the doses to the public from transporting material
off site for disposal should be evaluated against the doses received by the public around the site if the material is
left in place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has considered both the collective doses to populations and the individual doses to the average member of the
most highly exposed group of individuals (Critical Group). These considerations are reflected in the calculations
presented in the GEIS prepared in support of this rulemaking. In the scenarios considered, the annual collective
dose is quite small. Therefore, the staff concludes that limiting individual dose to the levels specified in the criteria
will assure that collective doses will be small and that the public health will be adequately protected. This is consistent
with past Commission practice in establishing radiological criteria.

4. Statement of Radiological Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing the staff's draft rule, attention was focused on four approaches: (1) establish an annual risk or dose
limit for an individual, (2) establish an annual risk or dose goal, (3) require use of best available technology, and
(4) require return of the site to background radioactivity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Most commenters from State governments, the nuclear utilities, the fuel cycle industry, the medical community and
non-fuel cycle industry, cleanup contractors, and professional society/standard setting organizations favored
a risk-based or dose-based standard over a standard based on best available technology or return to background. Most
commenters from citizen/environmental organizations and some from other organizations favored a return-to-background
standard. Many commenters objected to a best effort/best available technology standard for various reasons including
the belief that it would be extremely subjective.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule would establish a dose limit for release of the site of 15 millirem per year (mrem/y) TEDE for residual
radioactivity distinguishable from background and require that the licensee reduce this residual radioactivity
to ALARA. Sites meeting this criterion would be considered acceptable for release for unrestricted use and termination
of the license. Fifteen mrem/y TEDE is consistent in terms of risk with the NRC release limits for low-level waste facilities
(10 CFR 61.41), is consistent with the individual dose protection limit in the EPA Environmental Radiation Protection
Standards for the Management and Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel, High-level and Transuranic Wastes, 40 CFR Part 191
(December 20, 1993; 58 FR 66398), and provides a substantial safety margin below the NRC's 100 mrem/y dose limit for
individual members of the public. Use of a dose limit is consistent with long standing NRC (and AEC) regulatory practices
for protecting radiation workers and the public. The use of a limit also provides a clear measure for determining the
acceptability of a site and a clear basis for determinations of compliance with the regulations.

The NRC staff agrees that the objective of decommissioning should be to reduce residual radioactivity at a site to
levels that are indistinguishable from background. Therefore, the draft rule proposed to establish the following
goal for decommissioning within the structure of reducing exposure below the limit to as low as reasonably achievable:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reduce the concentration of individual radionuclides which could contribute to residual radioactivity at the
site to a level which is indistinguishable from background;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Release the site for unrestricted use; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Terminate the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of determining when further ALARA efforts need not be further analyzed and documented, the Commission
would consider that the ALARA requirement has been met if the TEDE to the average member of the critical group from all
radionuclides that could contribute to residual radioactivity and are distinguishable from background does not
exceed 3 mrem (0.03 mSv) per year. Three millirem per year is a small fraction of the NRC's 100 mrem/y dose limit for individual
members of the public, typically is not distinguishable from variations in local and national radiation background
levels, and is consistent with the 10

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 level of lifetime risk used by EPA for Superfund. Dose based criteria were selected over risk based criteria for ease
of implementation. Based upon comments received on the NRC staff draft, the Commission has decided to remove the numerical
values of 3 millirem per year from the proposed rule. However, the Commission remains committed to the objective of
decommissioning to levels that are indistinguishable from background.

 Many commenters urged that all regulatory agencies (EPA, NRC, State and local governments, etc.) use the same radiological
criteria for decommissioning and that the agencies be consistent in how they apply the criteria. Some commenters
said that the NRC's adoption of a risk/dose limit of 100 millirem per year, with a proper application of ALARA, would
result in a 10

 The NRC is hopeful that the proposed criteria developed through the enhanced participatory rulemaking process will
be acceptable to all regulatory agencies and will be consistent and compatible with the requirements of other regulatory
agencies. The EPA and NRC have overlapping authority in the area of developing radiological criteria for decommissioning
for nuclear sites. In addition, decommissioned sites, if not remediated properly, could later be subject to remedial
action under EPA Superfund requirements. This is an outcome which is viewed as undesirable by both the EPA and NRC and
is considered unlikely because the proposed NRC criteria are designed to be consistent with the risk range incorporated
in EPA's Superfund requirements. NRC and EPA are developing decommissioning criteria in parallel rulemaking efforts.
The NRC and EPA are coordinating their efforts in this area to ensure that effective and consistent site decommissioning
standards are established while minimizing duplication of effort. Accordingly, the EPA was an important participant
in the NRC rulemaking workshops and is a cooperating agency in the preparation of the GEIS for the rulemaking. The NRC
has also consulted extensively with EPA throughout the rulemaking process. The objective is that EPA will be able
to make a finding that NRC decommissioning criteria provide adequate protection for the public and the environment
and will exclude NRC licensees from the EPA cleanup standards. In addition, State and local governments will have
opportunities to participate in certain individual decommissioning actions carried out under the proposed regulation.
Further discussion on participation may be found in item 7, below. Agreement State compatibility is discussed briefly
in a separate section near the end of this supplementary information.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters stated that the NRC's decommissioning standard should be long-lasting and provide a final solution
for decommissioning sites that are contaminated with radioactive material. The NRC's standard should be consistent
with EPA rules to assure that a site remediated under NRC's rules will not require further remediation under EPA rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters questioned whether it is possible to have finality in decommissioning standards because of likely
new information and improved technology in the future. They stated that sites should continue to be remediated as
necessary to meet new standards. Those opposed stated that rules should be changed only if a substantial increase
in public safety can be demonstrated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC staff believes that actions taken under the criteria in this rule need not be revisited unless, based on new
information, there is reason to believe that residual radioactivity remaining at the site could result in significant
public risk. Therefore, once a site has been decommissioned and the license terminated in accordance with the criteria
in the rule, the Commission would require additional cleanup only if, based on new information, it determines the
level of residual radioactivity at the site substantially violates these criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the NRC's experience in the SDMP and other decommissioning programs, it is important to provide a high level
of assurance that decommissioning actions conducted under the current criteria will not need to be revisited in the
future under potentially more restrictive criteria. Licensees have indicated a genuine reluctance to commit the
large financial and corporate resources necessary for complex decommissioning projects without these assurances.
Uncertainty with future criteria and the potential need for additional remediation introduces havoc in the planning
and conduct of effective decommissioning. Without some degree of finality in the criteria, licensees may be motivated
to forestall decommissioning actions pending development of more favorable criteria or less expensive decommissioning
technologies and waste disposal options. This approach manifests itself in extended administrative appeals and
litigation, which often redirects licensee resources away from efforts to reduce levels of contamination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, the NRC recognizes that there may be legitimate needs for additional remedial actions in the future
if significant additional contamination is discovered at a site or if the technical basis on which the criteria are
founded changes significantly, indicating that potential future residents of the sites may be at significantly
greater risk than previously anticipated. Therefore, the proposed criteria allow for additional remediation,
if necessary, if additional significant contamination is identified or if changes in the risk or health basis for
the criteria indicate the remediation is necessary to protect the public against significant radiological risks.

As noted in item 5, the EPA and NRC are working together closely in this rulemaking. Upon completion, the EPA will determine
through a formal notice and comment rulemaking whether the NRC's rule provides adequate protection for public health
and the environment. This should minimize the risk that in the future the EPA would require additional cleanup of a
site which has been decommissioned in accordance with the criteria in this rule.

 Many commenters recommended that the rulemaking should provide for and ensure local citizen group participation
in overseeing the decommissioning of contaminated sites and the enforcement of requirements. Also, the role of tribal
authorities should be addressed. Some commenters stated that the NRC should ensure citizen participation in decommissioning
from the earliest stage of cleanup.

 The NRC staff believes it is important for the public to not only be fully informed of the decommissioning actions at
a particular site but also to be able to effectively participate in site decommissioning decisions. The proposed
rule provides specific mechanisms for public participation in the decommissioning process, where participation
is important to ensuring that the public is adequately informed about proposed decommissioning activities or that
the public and environment are adequately protected in conjunction with reliance on institutional controls to restrict
site access after license termination. These activities are in addition to whatever hearing opportunities are provided
for a particular category of site by the Commission's existing requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon the receipt of a decommissioning plan from the licensee, or a proposal by the licensee for restricted release
of a site, or whenever the Commission deems such a notice to be in the public interest, the Commission will:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Notify local and State governments in the vicinity of the site and Indian Nation or other indigenous people that
have treaty or statutory rights that could be affected by the decommissioning;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as well as in other media, such as local newspapers, which are readily accessible to individuals in the vicinity of
the site; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Solicit public comment on the proposed decommissioning action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For decommissioning actions where the licensee proposes to request license termination with land use restrictions,
the licensee will be required to convene a Site Specific Advisory Board (SSAB) for the purpose of obtaining advice
from affected parties regarding the proposed decommissioning. The SSAB will function at the planning stages of decommissioning,
at the time the licensee is developing the decommissioning plan for the facility. The purpose of the SSAB is to provide
recommendations to the licensee on:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether there are ways to reduce residual radioactivity to the levels that will permit release for unrestricted
use which are technically achievable, will not be prohibitively expensive, and will not result in net public or environmental
harm;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether provisions for institutional controls proposed by the licensee will:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Provide reasonable assurance that the TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to
the average member of the Critical Group will not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE per year,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Be enforceable,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Impose undue burdens on the local community or other affected parties; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether the licensee has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume
and carry out responsibilities for any necessary control and maintenance of the site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee will be responsible for establishing the SSAB and developing appropriate ground rules and operating
procedures with the SSAB's advice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSAB membership, to the extent that representatives are willing to participate, will have to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reflect the full range of interests in the affected community and region and be composed of individuals who could
be directly affected by residual radioactivity at the decommissioned site, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Include representatives from the licensee; local and State governments; workers; persons residing in the vicinity
of the site; citizen, environmental, environmental justice, and other public interest groups; and Indian Nation
or other indigenous people that have treaty or statutory rights that could be affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSAB meetings will be open to the public. The licensee will be required to provide adequate public notice of the location,
time, date, and agenda for the meetings at least two weeks in advance of each meeting. All records generated or reviewed
by the SSAB will become part of the decommissioning docket and be available for public inspection.

Comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters stated that NRC decommissioning standards are needed to facilitate long-term planning by the
nuclear industry and to provide stability against constantly changing criteria over the years. Some commenters
stated that even generic standards may not be completely stable because they will need to be changed as a result of newly
perceived health effects and improvements in technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters indicated that the rule must be flexible enough to accommodate site differences, e.g., types of radionuclides
present, the geology and environmental surroundings, individuals who may be exposed, and possible exposure patterns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters favored a generic standard over site-specific standards. While supporting the establishment of
a generic standard, some urged the NRC to permit site-specific considerations and site-specific modeling for licensees
to demonstrate compliance and to ensure participation by local communities. One commenter stated it would be a mistake
to use a generic ALARA evaluation for all sites. Several commenters recommended site-specific ALARA assessments.
Some commenters, particularly in the GEIS scoping meetings, suggested that the rule only provide the process for
establishing site-specific criteria.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The staff agrees that there is a need for consistent and stable radiological criteria for the decommissioning of licensed
nuclear facilities throughout the United States. Therefore, this rulemaking would establish a single set of radiological
criteria that would apply to the decommissioning of all sites. However, the staff also recognizes the need for flexibility
in applying these criteria because of constraints posed by site specific conditions (e.g. geology, hydrology, meteorology,
and radiation background levels) and to provide opportunity for meaningful participation by local communities
in individual decommissioning actions. Therefore, the rule proposed by the staff provides for site-specific implementation
of the generic criteria. The Commission would also publish regulatory guidance along with the rule that describes
methods for site-specific implementation of the criteria. This guidance includes conduct of site characterization
and surveys, specific radionuclide concentration and surface activities that would be considered by the NRC staff
to meet the decommissioning limit, and modeling acceptable to the NRC staff to develop more site-specific values
of concentration or surface activity based upon the factors unique to the activity being decommissioned. In this
regard, the NRC is working with the EPA and the DOE to develop a Federal Government manual for the conduct of surveys
to determine compliance with decommissioning criteria. When completed, this effort will assist in the consistent
treatment of all sites requiring remediation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff believes that generic criteria should be established for decommissioning and that codifying radiological
criteria for decommissioning in the regulations would:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Allow the NRC to more effectively assure protection of public health and the environment at decommissioned sites;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Result in more efficient use of NRC and licensee resources;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Lead to more consistent and uniform application across all types of licenses;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Provide a more stable basis for decommissioning planning; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Eliminate protracted delays in decommissioning that result as licensees wait for generic regulatory criteria
before proceeding with decommissioning of their facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC does not favor the option suggested of providing a process based rule whereby the criteria codified would only
be for the process to be used in establishing site-specific radiological criteria. This approach would be essentially
the same as the option of remaining with the current 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
status quo.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In general, a site-specific approach can lead to considerable delays and increased uncertainty on the part of all
parties associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decommissioning. Further, this approach would be inappropriate and burdensome for the large number of licensees
using sealed sources or radionuclides with relatively short half-lives.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the ALARA concept, decommissioning activities are continued beyond meeting applicable risk/dose limits
in efforts to reduce radiation exposures As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA). Most commenters recommended that
the NRC's radiological criteria should incorporate this principle. Several commenters stated that State and local
governments should be involved in ALARA determinations. However, other commenters expressed distrust of the licensees'
and regulatory agencies' application of the ALARA process because it involves financial tradeoffs and licensees
are motivated to maximize their profits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule requires application of the ALARA concept, provided that potential doses are constrained within
limiting doses under a range of conditions. NRC anticipates that many licensees, particularly sealed source users
or those who use relatively short-lived radioactive materials, will be able to satisfy the ALARA criteria with an
analysis of projected dose levels. In these cases, extensive additional documentation to support an ALARA determination
would not be required. State and local governments and other affected parties will be involved in ALARA determinations
through opportunities to comment on decommissioning proposals and participation on the Site-Specific Advisory
Board in those cases where the licensee is seeking license termination under restricted conditions. This level of
involvement provides for transparent application of the ALARA considerations and safeguards against excessive
licensee attention to cutting costs to maintain profit margins.

 Many commenters stated that for the most effective use of resources and fairness, the NRC must consider in the risk-benefit
balance not only radiological risks to workers and the public but, also, non-radiological risks and indirect risks
associated with the regulation of decommissioning activities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The staff agrees that all significant public and environmental risks should be considered. The GEIS for this rulemaking
assesses both radiological and non-radiological impacts for the proposed rule and several alternative actions,
including the alternative of no remedial action. In addition, the proposed rule would require that the licensee,
when determining ALARA for a specific decommissioning, consider all significant radiological and non-radiological
risks resulting from residual radioactivity and from the decommissioning process itself (including transportation
and disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the process).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, the necessary ALARA analysis will go beyond the relatively simple cost-benefit analysis that has typically
been applied in the nuclear industry in limiting worker exposures because the types of risks being considered are
not things that can be easily quantified or compared. For example, transportation poses immediate risks in terms
of fatalities due to highway accidents in hauling the radioactive contamination to appropriate disposal sites.
Some individuals and organizations have suggested that these anticipated fatalities should not be considered as
having the same seriousness or likelihood as the potential deaths at some point in the future of individuals that may
inhabit former nuclear sites after license termination. ALARA, or perceptions of what should be considered as ALARA,
may also vary because of values placed on minimizing the number of new disposal sites, preserving existing resources,
or preserving viable industries for jobs. Each of these factors were discussed in the workshops, and the staff believes
that these same factors may need to be considered in determining the ALARA level for remediation at a particular site.
The NRC is developing guidance on how the ALARA process could be applied in evaluating alternative radiological criteria
for decommissioning on a site-specific basis.

 The NRC staff agrees with this stated conclusion that, as a guiding principle, radiation protection standards do
not warrant different treatment than those for other health issues. In this regard, the staff has carefully considered
both the criteria and the implementation of those criteria in other environmental remediation programs (e.g., the
EPA Superfund program). The staff believes the criteria proposed in this rulemaking are generally consistent with
those used in other environmental remediation programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters stated that cleaning up to any specified level is technically achievable and is simply a matter
of how much it will cost. Some believed that decommissioning costs to return sites to unrestricted use could be so high
that the sites should be kept under continued control and maintained as a restricted area. Some commenters suggested
that money saved on unnecessary decommissioning activities might be used in other activities more beneficial to
the public. Other commenters stated that money saved on decommissioning costs would not necessarily be available
for societal betterment.

Response.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule recognizes that it may not be reasonable to remediate some sites to a level that permits release for
unrestricted use. The costs involved, either in dollars or in potential harm to the environment or people, may be prohibitive.
In these cases, the proposed rule provides for termination of the license under restricted conditions. The staff
is also aware that in some unusual cases sites may have to remain under license indefinitely. For example, the NRC is
aware of certain sites that are so contaminated by elevated levels of the naturally occurring radionuclides uranium,
thorium, and their decay products that it would be extremely difficult and costly to satisfy the proposed criteria
for unrestricted or restricted release. In these cases, the staff anticipates that the sites would have to remain
under a license indefinitely until new, more efficient technologies are developed or the financial resources become
available to pay for more complete remediation. The Commission has no authority over expenditure of funds that might
be saved by avoiding what were termed ``unnecessary decommissioning activities.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters stated that, although the cost of decommissioning could be high, remediation technologies are
available for achieving whatever level is set by the NRC. The NRC should describe acceptable methodologies for remediation
and measurement to reduce subjective judgments and should ensure that workers who perform remediation are appropriately
trained and protected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Before the effective date of the final rule, the NRC will provide interim guidance for use and comment on acceptable
methodologies for demonstrating compliance with the Commission's residual radioactivity criteria. After one
to two years' implementation experience is gained from use of the interim guidance, the collected comments will be
addressed and the final guidance will be issued. However, the NRC staff does not believe that it would be appropriate
to prescribe, a priori, the methods to be used. Licensees must be able to take advantage of whatever safe methodologies
may be available for achieving remediation that complies with the criteria for decommissioning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workers performing decommissioning must receive training in radiation protection according to the requirements
of the Commission's requirements in 10 CFR 19.12, ``Instructions to Workers.'' Likewise, workers participating
in decommissioning activities will be subject to all of the provisions of 10 CFR Part 20, including requirements related
to personnel monitoring, respiratory protection, occupational dose limits, and ALARA. In this regard, the staff
does not view the conduct of decommissioning activities to be any different from other operational activities licensed
by the Commission.

 Several commenters stated that demonstration of compliance with NRC decommissioning rules and applicable radiological
limits is a major issue. The commenters believe the NRC must provide clear guidelines with respect to the kinds of measurements
that are necessary and the models that are acceptable to demonstrate compliance. With respect to measurements, guidance
should cover:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Acceptable measurement methods;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Extent of measurements needed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Use of field instruments versus laboratory instruments;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Statistical sampling; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Calibration standards and measurement certification.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to models and methodologies, guidance should be provided on their use, uncertainties, and how to apply
site-specific characteristics. The NRC must make sufficient confirmatory measurements to check that the standards
have been met and NRC should enforce the standards.

Several commenters pointed out that, whatever risk standard the NRC may adopt, compliance will likely need to be determined
by a computer model except for small operations when contamination levels are within specified generic criteria.
Other commenters stated that decontamination limits should be established and dose modeling should not be relied
on to demonstrate compliance. Comments were split on whether risk limits might be needed for different exposure pathways.

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Before the effective date of the final rule, NRC plans to issue specific guidance that includes conservative radiation
levels, surface contamination limits, and radioactivity concentrations for use by licensees who elect to apply
a generic model to demonstrate compliance. Guidance on measurements covering the above listed five subjects will
also be provided. The NRC appreciates that guidance is essential especially where the licensee must demonstrate
compliance with criteria that require reduction of residual radioactivity to near background levels. The NRC expects
to make sufficient confirmatory measurements to ensure compliance with the criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule limits the total exposure from all pathways and, except for the purpose of groundwater protection,
does not set limits for individual pathways. The groundwater protection requirement has been included at the request
of the EPA to ensure conformance with EPA groundwater protection requirements. Because exposure pathways vary in
importance to public dose depending on the radioisotope involved, site-specific parameters, and the circumstances
under which the site might be used after decommissioning, the staff believes that, as a general rule, no useful purpose
would be served by placing limits on individual pathways. In the selection of conservative default values for use
by licensees who do not wish to utilize site-specific modeling, the most critical pathways and scenarios of exposure
are assumed to be dominant. The absence of limits on individual pathways provides the licensee with more flexibility
in limiting radiation exposures while at the same time providing adequate overall public protection.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters stated that the NRC should establish standards for both unrestricted and restricted release of sites
while others recommended that the NRC require all sites to be remediated suitably for unrestricted use. Some commenters
stated that sites should continue to be licensed by the NRC if they cannot be reasonably decontaminated. Also, commenters
stated that the NRC should consider the option of restricted future use of decommissioned facilities only after a
rigorous public participation process. Many commenters stated that unrestricted release should be the goal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 but that realistically, some sites cannot be remediated suitably for unrestricted release.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provides for both unrestricted release and restricted termination of the license under prescribed
conditions. The requirement that the licensee convene a Site-Specific Advisory Board early in the development of
proposed decommissioning plans should help ensure substantive public participation in decisions concerning possible
restricted termination of the license. As previously discussed, the staff is aware of sites, such as sites with significant
volumes of thorium contamination, that will require extensively remedial efforts to achieve the proposed requirements
for restricted or unrestricted release. If these sites cannot be remediated to achieve at least the restricted release
criteria, then the site license will remain in effect indefinitely until technology or resources become available
to achieve compliance with the criteria. In the interim period, NRC will ensure appropriate control of the licensed
site on a site-specific basis, including access restrictions, environmental monitoring, personnel monitoring,
posting, mitigative actions, and other measures directed at ensuring the stability of the radioactive material
and protection of the public health and the environment.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters questioned whether there is enough space at a regional disposal facility for the voluminous soils
and other materials that are expected from decommissioned sites. Other commenters stated that irrespective of where
or how wastes are disposed, the costs of nuclear waste management will be high. Some commenters suggested that the
option of leaving radioactive wastes on-site should be considered as a temporary or intermediate option to permit
decay of radioactive wastes and allow time for resolving long-term waste disposal problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff recognizes that decommissioning to radiation levels approaching background may produce large volumes
of low-level waste which could affect the availability of regional disposal capacity. However, the proposed rule
would require the licensee to consider significant radiation doses and risks resulting from transportation and
disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the decommissioning process when determining ALARA for a specific decommissioning
action. If disposal capacity were to become temporarily limited, on-site storage and containment of wastes may be
necessary until a disposal site becomes available. However, any temporary onsite storage and containment of radioactive
wastes be done under the provisions of an existing NRC license, and the site would not be decommissioned until this
waste had been removed from the site. The radiological and non-radiological impacts associated with disposal of
the types of radioactive waste generated in decommissioning were considered in NRC's development of the Environmental
Impact Statement in support of the low-level waste disposal requirements in 10 CFR Part 61. Impacts associated with
extended storage of waste onsite or at a centralized storage facility would typically be considered as part of environmental
analysis in support of issuing or renewing facility licenses or of approving decommissioning actions at a licensed
facility.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters recommended that the NRC discourage or stop licensing nuclear operations that generate nuclear
wastes. Several commenters stated that environmental organizations would be willing to talk about ways to decommission
nuclear operations and to dispose of radioactive materials only if power plants were no longer permitted to operate.
Other commenters supported the continuation of nuclear power. One commenter urged the NRC not to take sides for or
against nuclear power and stated that the policy debate on the relative merits of various power-generating options
should be held in another forum (e.g., Congress). Some commenters observed that high costs of decommissioning and
waste disposal could help to minimize waste generation. Some commenters recommended that the rulemaking should
deal with source reduction of nuclear wastes. Some commenters suggested that decommissioning proposals should
be submitted and approved at the design stage and, consequently, newer facilities should be easier to decommission.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC agrees that newly licensed facilities should be encouraged in designing and operating nuclear facilities
to minimize the generation of radioactive waste and facility contamination. The proposed rule would require applicants
for licenses, other than renewals, after the effective date of the rule to describe in the application how facility
design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of the facility and the environment, facilitate
eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive waste.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters recommended that the NRC should impose limits to control exposure from radon emissions at decommissioned
sites because radon exposures could be a significant health problem. Commenters in favor of NRC setting a radon standard
stated it should be possible to make a good estimate of how much radon comes from licensed material. Commenters not
supporting the NRC's setting a radon standard stated that the need to deal with radon at licensed sites should be considered
site-to-site and that radon control should be left to local zoning boards and housing authorities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff believes that it is not possible to measure or distinguish concentrations of radon which will produce
radiation doses of a few mrem TEDE/y above background using current technology. This belief is based on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Recognition of the ubiquitous nature of radon in the general environment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Large uncertainties in the models used to project radon concentrations in indoor air based on soil concentrations
of precursors; and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Limitations of existing measurement techniques in distinguishing between elevated radon concentrations and
radon attributed to natural sources. Therefore, the staff does not propose to establish a separate standard for radon.
Instead, exposure to radon at decommissioned sites would be controlled by requiring the licensee to reduce the residual
concentrations of radon precursors like uranium, thorium, and radium to levels within the limit for unrestricted
use and, using the ALARA principle, toward levels which are indistinguishable from background levels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters recommended that the NRC develop standards for protecting natural ecosystems in addition to standards
protecting humans. Others expressed concern for environmental protection without recommending for or against
establishing separate environmental standards. A large number of commenters recommended that protection of human
health is sufficient to protect any known ecological system. Therefore, only a standard for protecting humans is
needed. Commenters stated that this is the view of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters recommended that case-by-case consideration should be given for special environmental and social/cultural
issues associated with homeland, historical sites, and Native American lands because they contain religious sites
and sacred areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters cautioned against establishment of unnecessarily restrictive decommissioning standards
that could cause severe environmental damage trying to clean up soil and vegetation to background levels because
these actions could totally change a site's ecology.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC considered the possible need for radiation standards specifically designed to protect the environment.
This analysis is reflected in the draft GEIS. Based on this analysis, the staff concludes that the radiological criteria
in the proposed rule which are designed to protect public health should also provide adequate environmental protection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the NRC staff recognizes there may be environmental or cultural issues associated with a particular decommissioning
action which require special consideration. These issues can best be handled on a site-by-site basis as part on the
decommissioning plan review process and as part of the Commission's environmental review under the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA). Where necessary, opportunity for public comment and use of the Site-Specific Advisory Board will
provide a mechanism for local citizens and other affected parties to be directly involved in addressing these issues.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were offered for and against whether NRC should permit recycling of contaminated materials. Those in favor
recommended recycling to save resources. Those opposed recommended against recycling to limit public risk. Other
commenters stated that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has recommended that the maximum dose to any
individual from recycled material not exceed one millirem per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the proposed rule does not specifically address recycle, the NRC staff believes the radiological criteria
in the proposed rule provide reasonable assurance that future inadvertent recycle of soils or structures following
decommissioning of a site will not adversely affect public health. The analysis which supports the rule, although
it does not specifically take recycle into account, is based on prudently conservative scenarios which tend to overestimate
expected public doses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases where the licensee achieves residual radioactivity levels that are indistinguishable from background,
the potential doses from inadvertent recycle are expected to be insignificant. In cases where the residual radioactivity
cannot be reduced to the point that it is indistinguishable from background, the licensee will have to consider inadvertent
recycle when conducting the ALARA analysis for the site. Therefore, steps can be taken on a site-specific basis to
impose additional restrictions if inadvertent recycle appears to pose a significant potential problem at that site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission plans to consider separately the issues of how to deal with cases where the licensee proposes to release
material containing residual radioactivity intentionally for reuse or recycle either as a part of decommissioning
or ongoing operations. In the interim the Commission will continue to be review these actions on a case-by-case basis.

Overview of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were 1685 comments from the 89 docketed letters received on the NRC staff draft. These comments were similar
to those from the workshops with respect to the wide range of expressed views. Two subjects on which the commenters
were in general agreement were (1) the appropriateness of the rulemaking process, and (2) the significance of not
having the GEIS and the guidance documents available for review. The commenters strongly favor the enhanced participatory
rulemaking process but said that the GEIS and the guidance documents are needed in order to understand the basis for
the rule and how it would be implemented. The NRC staff considered these comments in the development of the proposed
rule.

Comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters supported the NRC's efforts to develop radiological decommissioning standards. However, some questioned
whether the NRC should defer to the EPA and suggested that the NRC await the EPA's efforts to develop these standards.
Several commenters urged that the NRC reconsider and delete the exclusion of previously approved decommissioning
plans from the new requirements. Others recommended retention of this exclusion and its expansion to cover decommissioning
plans already in the final stages of NRC review and approval. A comment reported often was that the NRC should issue
its proposed radiological criteria for final public review and comment only after the NRC has completed and issued
the companion GEIS and other guidance documents needed to facilitate understanding of the proposed rulemaking.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the question of whether the NRC should let the EPA take the lead in developing radiological decommissioning
standards, the NRC will have to proceed with rulemaking in any case. If EPA develops standards, the NRC will have to
promulgate a regulation to implement the EPA standard. Therefore, it was jointly decided that parallel NRC/EPA efforts
would be the best approach. The NRC has worked closely with the EPA and will continue to do so. As a result of this interactive
cooperation, progress has been made that would have been unlikely otherwise. It is believed important that both agencies
continue to work on this effort (see discussion under Item 4, Consistency and Compatibility). With respect to previously
approved decommissioning plans, the Commission believes it is important to encourage licensees to take timely decommissioning
actions. Accordingly, the Commission is retaining the exclusion of previously approved decommissioning plans
in the new requirements and is expanding the provisions to include plans under final stages of NRC review. Regarding
the need for public review of the GEIS and other guidance documents, the Commission fully agrees. The GEIS, a regulatory
analysis (RA), and an NRC staff working draft regulatory guide will be issued concurrently with publication of the
proposed rulemaking. The formal comment period for the rulemaking will commence with this

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were divided concerning whether NRC decommissioning standards should be based on the recommendations
of recognized national and international bodies such as the ICRP and NCRP. Many citizen/environmental organizations
continued to recommend that the NRC should require decontaminating to a level indistinguishable from background.
They opposed setting any acceptable risk level or radiation dose for decommissioning because they believe that any
incremental increase over background dose is unacceptable. Most industry and other commenters recommended that
the decommissioning standard be based on technically supportable risk/dose criteria. Some commenters urged that
the proposed level be decided only after analyzing the costs and benefits of alternative proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters objected to inclusion of a quantitative goal in the rulemaking because it could be interpreted by
some as the standard that should be achieved in most cases. Other commenters agreed on inclusion of both a quantitative
goal and a quantitative limit. Some want these to be lower than the levels specified_TEDEs of 3 mrem and 15 mrem per year.
Many citizen/environmental organization commenters stated that, instead of specifying a numerical goal and a limit,
the regulatory objective should be to reduce contamination to a level that is not distinguishable from background.
Other commenters stated that doses in the range of 3 mrem to 15 mrem per year are indistinguishable from background.
Most of these commenters recommended that the dose limit should be increased to a level between 25 and 100 mrem per year,
or possibly higher. Reasons for recommending a higher dose limit included (1) the criteria should conform to recommendations
of national and international scientific consensus organizations; (2) a cost-benefit analysis would support a
higher limit; (3) the criteria should be based on scientific analyses and not based on intuitive feelings; (4) there
are no practical means to demonstrate compliance with TEDEs of 3 and 15 mrem per year; and (5) efforts to comply with
such levels would waste large resources in remediating small risks with no real gain in benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommended that the goal be dropped from the rule. Some of these commenters suggested the goal
instead be incorporated into the guidance that would accompany the rule. A principal concern was that the goal would
become a de facto limit. In particular, the EPA, in presenting their comments on the goal, indicated concern over the
perception that the specification of any value, such as 3 mrem/yr, would be construed as the actual requirement for
the decommissioning. The EPA has verbally continued to express concerns regarding the NRC staff proposal of presenting
acceptable staff positions for ALARA documentation in the Regulatory Guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters requested that, because of possible failure of institutional controls, the NRC should not place
a dose restriction of 100 mrem per year on sites subject to restricted release. Commenters were divided on the requirement
that licensees base their estimates of greatest TEDE dose on the first 1000 years. Some stated that this time is unrealistically
long while others stated that it is unrealistically short. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters compared the proposed limits of 15 mrem/y and 3 mrem/y to risk limits/goals attributed to the EPA
and suggested that these comparisons are complicated by differences in scenarios for exposure used by the EPA and
the NRC, and by a basic difference between a limit and a goal. A limit must always be reached. A goal is not always reached.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters requested that the NRC include alternative radiological criteria for licensees who possess radioactive
materials of a kind and form not requiring extensive decontamination at the time of decommissioning. They suggested
that demonstration of compliance should be possible through direct radiation measurements and not require the use
of modeling and consultants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following responses are provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Appropriateness of 15 mrem/y TEDE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has considered the comments in light of information presented in the Generic Environmental Impact
Statement (GEIS) and the Regulatory Analysis (RA). These studies show that residual radioactivity can be reduced
to levels which will result in an annual TEDE of 15 mrem without unreasonable effort or expense for most radionuclides
and most facilities. A summary of this analysis can be found in Sections 5 through 7 of the GEIS and Sections 4 and 6 of
the RA. In those few cases where reducing the residual radioactivity to the levels required to comply with the 15 mrem/y
TEDE limit for unrestricted use are either not technically achievable, would be prohibitively expensive, or would
result in net public or environmental harm, &sect;20.1405 of the proposed rule provides the licensee with the option
of requesting release of the site with restrictions placed on its use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters have argued that a 15 mrem/y limit for unrestricted release is not consistent with the recommendations
of the ICRP and NCRP and that the limit should be raised to as high as 100 mrem/y. The Commission believes that an additional
margin of safety below 100 mrem/yr is necessary because the 100 mrem/y limit is intended to apply to doses to the public
resulting from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
radiation sources (NCRP Report No. 116, Section 15; ICRP Publication 60, Section 5.5). Therefore, allocation of
the entire 100 mrem/y dose to residual radioactivity from the decommissioning of a single facility would be inappropriate.
Using a safety margin to limit the dose from a single source to avoid a summation of exposures approaching the dose limit
is consistent with the recommendations of both the ICRP and the NCRP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Removal of Goal from the NRC staff Draft Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As formulated in the NRC staff draft rule, the goal was designed to serve two principal objectives. First, and foremost,
it would clearly articulate the NRC's objective for decommissioned sites. Second, it would establish a dose level
well below the limit at which licensees who have little or no site contamination (e.g., licensees that use only sealed
sources or short lived radioisotopes) would be relieved of much of the burden of analysis associated with the ALARA
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reexamined the goal concept based on the comments received, and has concluded that having both a limit
and a goal in the rule can lead to confusion concerning the Commission's intent. Therefore, in order to clarify the
Commission's intent and to make it clear that 15 mrem/y TEDE is the only limit, the Commission has dropped the term ``goal''
from the rule. Instead the Commission has substituted the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, in order to clearly articulate the Commission's continued commitment to the objective for decommissioned
sites, the following statement of objective has been included in &sect;20.1402 of the proposed rule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of decommissioning is to reduce the residual radioactivity in structures, materials, soils, groundwater,
and other media at the site so that the concentration of each radionuclide that could contribute to residual radioactivity
is indistinguishable from the background radiation concentration for that radionuclide. The Commission realizes
that, as a practical matter, it would be extremely difficult to demonstrate that such an objective has been met. Therefore,
the Commission has established a site release limit and is requiring that licensees demonstrate that the residual
radioactivity at a site is as far below this limit as reasonably achievable.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, in order to provide administrative relief to licensees who have little or no site contamination, the Commission
has revised &sect;20.1404 of the rule to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A site will be considered acceptable for unrestricted use if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) the residual radioactivity that is distinguishable from background radiation results in a TEDE to the average
member of the critical group that does not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) per year; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the residual radioactivity has been reduced to levels that are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Depending on the site-specific ALARA analysis, any dose level less than or equal to 15 mrem/y may be considered ALARA.
However, in many situations, licensees who have little or no site contamination should be able to readily achieve
a dose level well below the limit. The NRC will provide guidance as to how such licensees can demonstrate compliance
with Section 20.1404(b) without having to perform sophisticated analyses to demonstrate that residual radioactivity
levels at their sites are ALARA. This should substantially reduce the administrative burden on licensees who have
little or no site contamination (e.g., licensees that use only sealed sources or short lived radioisotopes). There
are approximately 17,000 NRC and Agreement State licensees, many of which are small businesses, that are expected
to benefit from this guidance without any compromise to public health and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Time Frame. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated in the rationale for the proposed rule, the Commission believes the 1000 year time frame proposed
by the NRC staff is reasonable for estimating annual doses from residual radioactivity from decommissioned sites.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When predicting thousands of years into the future, uncertainties become very large because of major potential changes
in the hydrogeologic regime at the site over these long periods of time. When the potential consequences of exposure
to the radioactive source are great; e.g., as in the case of a high level waste repository, distant future calculations
may provide some insight concerning the relative magnitude of consequences. However, the consequences of exposure
to residual radioactivity at levels near background are small and considering the large uncertainties, long term
modeling of near background doses may be virtually meaningless. Thus, the Commission does not believe it would serve
any useful purpose to attempt to estimate radiation doses from residual radioactivity thousands of years into the
future.

3. Individual vs Collective Doses

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that collective dose should be used by the NRC to evaluate costs and benefits of alternative
radiological criteria. The Department of Energy suggested that an ALARA analysis, based on collective dose and competing
risks for certain sites with low population exposure, might indicate that the criteria proposed by the NRC may not
be justifiable. Most commenters favored using dose to individuals to ensure protection of the public health. Many
citizen/environmental groups disagreed with the proposal to limit individual dose to the ``average member of the
Critical Group.'' They recommended that the goal and limit as described in the staff's draft rule be applied to the
maximally exposed individual in the exposure group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission agrees with the commenters that collective dose should be used by the NRC to evaluate the costs and benefits
of alternative radiological criteria. In fact, this has been incorporated in the assessment of the total risk for
the respective alternatives in the GEIS and the RA. Although these documents were unavailable for review by the commenters,
the technical analyses in the GEIS and the RA support the criteria in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission considers the use of TEDE to the average member of the Critical Group to be a more useful concept for the
purposes of decommissioning for the reasons discussed in the Rationale for the Proposed Rule. The discussion of ``Critical
Group'' in the Rationale has been revised to make it clear that the critical group must be reasonably homogeneous.
This clarifies that the licensee cannot average doses over a group whose members may be expected to get widely differing
doses for the purpose of ``averaging down'' expected doses to highly exposed individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Consistency and Compatibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As was the case at the earlier workshops, commenters urged that the NRC and the EPA work together to develop consistent
standards. Conservation of Federal resources and avoidance of imposing different standards on regulated parties
were considered to be important. However, the NRC was advised not to lower its risk limit simply to accommodate the
EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters recommended that the degree of consistency that the NRC will require between NRC standards and Agreement
State standards be clearly stated. One commenter suggested that the Federal standard be set to ensure adequate protection
of the public and that if a State or local community requires a licensee to decommission to a lower standard that does
not provide a significant benefit, then the State or local community should fund this extra effort. Agreement State
commenters requested that the statement of considerations for the proposed rulemaking discuss the extent to which
they must implement specific provisions of the rule to maintain continued regulatory compatibility with NRC regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the comments concerning the relationship between NRC and EPA standards, NRC and EPA are developing
decommissioning criteria in parallel rulemaking efforts. The NRC and EPA are coordinating their efforts in this
area to ensure that effective and consistent site decommissioning standards are established, while minimizing
duplication of effort. Accordingly, the EPA was an important participant in the NRC rulemaking workshops and is a
cooperating agency in the preparation of the GEIS for the rulemaking. The NRC has also consulted extensively with
EPA throughout the rulemaking process. The objective is that EPA will be able to make a finding that NRC decommissioning
criteria provide adequate protection for the public and the environment and will exclude NRC licensees from the EPA
cleanup standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the question of NRC/Agreement State compatibility, the Commission is developing a new policy on Agreement
State compatibility which will be issued for public comment in the near future. Because the compatibility determination
for this proposed rule will be considered in light of the new compatibility policy, the Commission believes it would
be premature to propose a compatibility determination at this time. However, to facilitate ultimate resolution
of the compatibility determination for this rule, if adopted as a final rule, the Commission is requesting comments
on whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances, an Agreement State should be authorized to establish more
stringent requirements than those set forth in this proposed rule.

5. Finality

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finality of decommissioning was a major issue among commenters. Various commenters stated (1) that revisiting sites
should be based on new site-specific information and not on new evaluation methods and (2) that the criteria for revisiting
sites are too subjective and require clarification or refinement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission agrees that the wording in the NRC staff draft was ambiguous. Therefore, &sect;20.1401(c) has been
revised to make it clear that the Commission would require additional cleanup only if, based on new information, it
determined that residual radioactivity remaining at the site could result in significant public risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Community Involvement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff draft specified that the Commission will inform the public of each receipt of a decommissioning plan
from a licensee and of each proposal for restricted release of a site. In addition, it specified that licensees who
propose to release sites under stipulated conditions of restricted release must convene a Site-Specific Advisory
Board (SSAB) for purpose of providing advice to the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several industry commenters questioned the need for these additional requirements on the grounds that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Present procedures for public participation in licensing procedures are adequate and provide an appropriate
way to deal with the concerns of those affected by decommissioning; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There is no demonstrated need; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The provisions of SSABs would put managerial, regulatory, and financial matters of licensees in the hands of people
who have no responsibility for the consequences of their recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most other commenters supported the proposed new community involvement proposals and some commenters additionally
urged the NRC to require establishment of an SSAB for all decommissioning cases, including sites suitable for unrestricted
release. Others recommended that an SSAB should be used in cases involving Native American lands, sites surrounded
by high density residential uses, ocean or waterfront sites, or sensitive ecosystems unless the three (3) millirem
per year decommissioning goal would be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional comments on the use of SSABs included: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The rulemaking should delimit SSAB roles and responsibilities;

(2) Guidelines are needed with respect to SSAB staffing and activities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) SSABs should not report to licensees or be funded by licensees because this could compromise their effective use;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Membership should be restricted to ``citizen, environmental, environmental justice, and other public interest
groups'' who reside in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local community; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The membership should include a representative of the site to which wastes are expected to be sent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 With respect to the need for additional community involvement, the Commission believes that the noticing requirements
and the requirements to establish and use SSABs should be implemented as proposed in the NRC staff draft. The proposed
termination of licenses and release of sites under conditions of restricted release involve issues (e.g., land restrictions)
which could have unanticipated adverse effects on the local community. The Commission wants to be sure it has considered
the views of affected members of the local community on these issues before making a decision on the licensee's request.
These proposed provisions will provide an effective means to inform the affected licensees, local and state governments,
and the NRC of these views. However, the Commission believes that an extension of the SSAB requirement to apply to cases
involving unrestricted release is unnecessary and would impose an undue burden with little or no public benefit on
a large number of licensees, many of which are small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to delimiting the role and responsibilities of SSABs and providing guidance on SSAB staffing and activities,
the Commission specifically requests further comment on these issues. After gaining experience with the formation
and use of SSABs, it might be appropriate to reconsider the need for this guidance at a later date. Regarding the funding
and control of SSABs, the Commission believes that licensees should provide the necessary funding as proposed. The
proposed rule contains safeguards to ensure that the SSABs are not subject to licensee control. The licensee would
be required to provide reasonable opportunity for all local affected parties to be represented on the SSAB. Meetings
of the SSAB must be open to the public. The licensee must provide adequate public notice of the location, time, date,
and agenda for the meetings at least two weeks in advance of each meeting. All records generated or reviewed by the SSAB
become part of the licensing docket and will be available for public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to restriction of the SSAB membership to the local community, the intent of the provisions in &sect;20.1407(c)
is such a restriction. Regarding the proposal to expand memberships of the SSAB to include a representative of the
designated offsite disposal site, the Commission believes that the offsite disposal site is not relevant for consideration
by the SSAB, because siting of the waste disposal facility involves a separate public process that, in part, recognizes
that wastes will be transported to the waste facility.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Most of those who commented on stability or flexibility provided in the draft rule said that a generic standard should
be written to provide enough flexibility to account for actual risks associated with conditions peculiar to specific
sites in protecting the public and the environment, and to select appropriate site-specific remediation methods.
Some commenters said that the imposition of strict generic standards without flexibility might not provide an optimum
protection strategy across the range of categories of licensees. Other commenters noted that the adequacy of flexibility
provided under the draft proposed rule cannot be decided without the necessary guidance documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission also recognizes the need for flexibility in applying these criteria because of constraints posed
by site-specific conditions (e.g., geology, hydrology, meteorology, and radiation background levels) and to provide
opportunity for meaningful participation by local communities in individual decommissioning actions. Therefore,
the proposed rule provides for site-specific implementation of the generic criteria. The Commission is publishing
the NRC staff's working draft regulatory guidance along with the proposed rule which describes methods for site-specific
implementation of the criteria. This working draft guidance includes conduct of site characterization and surveys,
specific radionuclide concentration and surface activities that would be considered by the NRC staff to meet the
15 mrem/y TEDE limit, and modeling acceptable to the staff to develop more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site-specific values of concentration or surface activity based upon the factors unique to the activity being decommissioned.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Comments on the ALARA concept were much the same as provided at the earlier workshops. Most public/environmental
organization commenters stated that they do not trust licensees to make ALARA determinations. Industry and other
commenters stated that they support the NRC's permitting them to make ALARA determinations and urged the NRC to continue
to permit licensees to use site specific factors in making these determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission believes that ALARA is a fundamental concept of radiation protection and is an important part of its
decommissioning criteria. NRC guidance being issued in support of the rulemaking provides for the use of site-specific
factors in deciding what levels should be achieved below the stipulated radiological limit. This guidance will be
described in NUREG&hyph;1500 ``Working Draft Regulatory Guide on Release Criteria for Decommissioning; Staff
Draft for Comment.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many submitting written comments urged the NRC to complete its guidance on acceptable methodologies criteria as
soon as possible and to publish this guidance for comment before the rulemaking is issued for final public comment.
Many commenters questioned the technical ability to demonstrate compliance with the proposed dose goals or limits
in the staff's draft, or questioned the technical justification for such requirements, or said that there are no standards
for demonstrations of compliance. Several others said that demonstrating compliance to the proposed dose goals
or limits is impractical and will unnecessarily increase costs and volumes of low-level wastes generated during
decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters said that there must be practical or objective guidance for demonstrating compliance. Some said
that this guidance should be issued for review before the rule is promulgated. Some commenters raised questions on
who makes the final decisions on demonstrating of compliance and by what means. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters suggested that simplified guidance (not requiring the use of modeling or consultants) should be
provided for designated licensees who have only low levels of contamination or ``uncomplicated situations'' in
their operations. Some commenters said that the public might more easily understand demonstration of compliance
if alternative limits to the ones proposed were used. Several commenters said that compliance should be demonstrated
by actual measurements and not just by modeling. Some commenters also suggested specific methodologies for demonstrating
compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The capabilities for demonstrating compliance are considered in the GEIS and the RA which provide the technical basis
for the radiological criteria in the rule. Guidance that is being issued for public comment in conjunction with the
publication of the proposed rule will cover acceptable methods for demonstrating compliance, the use of simplified
methods or practical derived measurements and measurements units, and verification by practical measurement techniques
not necessarily requiring modeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the question concerning who makes the final decisions on whether the licensee has demonstrated compliance
with the rule, the NRC or, as appropriate, the Agreement State will make this determination. Where necessary the NRC
or Agreement State will conduct independent confirmatory surveys to ensure that the appropriate criteria have been
met.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many public/environmental organization commenters stated that licensees should not be permitted to walk away from
a contaminated site and that contamination should be removed to the extent that radioactive materials and radiation
are indistinguishable from background. Many voiced opposition to any release of sites under restricted use conditions.
This opposition was based largely on concern about the long term effectiveness of institutional controls to ensure
compliance with the conditions for restricted release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters generally endorsed both the unrestricted and restricted release of sites. With respect to restricted
release of sites, commenters: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Stated that the NRC should better define the circumstances which could qualify a site for restricted release;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Recommended that the NRC give examples of acceptable institutional controls for providing reasonable assurance
that specified dose limits are not exceeded; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Requested that the NRC publish guidance on determination of necessary financial assurance for proper control
and maintenance of a site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters recommended that the NRC adopt a dose level below 100 mrem per year as the upper dose limit in the event
of failure of the applied institutional controls. Still other commenters stated that the 100 mrem per year restriction
could foreclose onsite disposal of wastes as presently permitted at uranium mill tailings sites and that this restriction
should be deleted. Several commenters requested that the NRC better address the issue of consolidation and long-term
care of wastes at sites not suitable for restricted release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that engineered disposal cells might be the best solution for sites with large quantities of slightly
contaminated soils, while another said that large volumes of slightly contaminated soil with a few ``hot spots''
should be regarded as homogeneously contaminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC believes that the rule should provide for both unrestricted release and for restricted release of sites. Additionally,
there may be sites that will have to continue under license. The NRC is issuing guidance, first in draft form for comment,
on how it expects to implement the provision for restricted release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 100 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
&blank;mrem/y restriction is designed to establish an upper bound on the risk in the unlikely event of failure of institutional
controls or restrictions at the site. This restriction is also designed to ensure that license termination under
restricted conditions does not result in a proliferation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 disposal sites. The Commission believes that 100 mrem/y is an adequately conservative upper bound. This dose corresponds
to the maximum annual dose during the first 1000 years following decommissioning. In many cases, the peak dose occurs
during the first year following decommissioning. For these cases, the predicted dose levels will be reduced by radioactive
decay so that if institutional controls or restrictions at the site were to fail some time in the future the actual public
dose would be substantially below 100 mrem/y in most cases. In cases where buildup of radioactive daughter products
or other conditions cause the peak dose to fall other than in the first year after decommissioning, the predicted dose
levels are significantly below 100 mrem/y for the large majority of the first 1000 years after decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of an appropriate value for the dose in the unlikely event of failure of institutional controls has been a
key point of the ongoing discussions between the EPA and the NRC. As noted in section entitled ``Rationale for the Proposed
Rule'' of this Statement of Considerations, the Commission is specifically soliciting comment on the appropriateness
of this value, and the impacts associated with the selection of other values such as 75 mrem/yr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disposal of tailings and soil cleanup at milling sites is regulated under the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control
Act of 1978 (UMTRCA). The impact of the dose limit on unique practices at uranium mill tailings sites may require case-by-case
consideration in the interest of consistency with current regulation of tailings under UMTRCA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A commenter stated that waste disposal issues must be discussed in the EIS. Some commenters stated that the criteria
do not seem to recognize and should more adequately consider the non-linear increase in waste volumes at low concentrations
of radioactive materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that the NRC should consider allowing for some decommissioning under restricted conditions
with on-site emplacement, storage, and monitoring of radioactive wastes. Several commenters stated that previously-buried
wastes should be cleaned up at the time of decommissioning consistent with the generic cleanup standard. Several
others disagreed, saying that it is ``unfair'' or unnecessary to include these previously-buried wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agreement State commenters were concerned over the adequacy of the space at regional disposal facilities for the
large amount of material to be generated from the decommissioned sites. The concern was enforced by the lack of a GEIS

 Waste disposal issues, including matters of the relationships between waste volumes and cleanup levels, are discussed
in the GEIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission maintains its position that public and environmental risk is an overriding factor that requires the
consideration of the removal of previously-buried wastes as a part of decommissioning. Even though a previous burial
was carried out within the regulatory requirements at an operating site, the potential differences in conditions
between the site as operated and as decommissioned require such consideration. The requirements for previously-buried
wastes are consistent with the Commission's established regulatory practice for decommissioning under the Site
Decommissioning Management Plan (SDMP). The proposed rule requires an analysis of site-specific overall risks,
costs, and benefits in deciding, for individual sites, whether or not the exhumation and removal of previously-buried
wastes is required.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC staff draft contained a section on minimization of contamination. Most commenters supported the concept
of minimization of contamination, but several industry commenters preferred not to include the proposed provisions
in the rulemaking on radiological criteria for decommissioning. Industry commenters stated that these concepts
do not need to be put in regulations because waste minimization and hence, minimization of contamination, is commonplace
in the nuclear industry and is driven by such economic incentives as reduction of disposal costs. Some commenters
recommended that the NRC publish guidelines for public comment on the actions that licensees are expected to take
in minimizing the production or release of contamination, and that the NRC should similarly publish for public comment
the criteria it will use to determine if licensee proposals are acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission agrees that existing ALARA programs and the cost of radioactive waste disposal provide sufficient
incentive to minimize radioactive waste. Therefore, requiring licensees to redesign existing facilities or amend
already approved radiation protection procedures is unnecessary and would not result in any substantial improvement
in public safety. Therefore, &sect;20.1408 (b) and (c) have been deleted from the proposed rule. However, the Commission
believes that there may be substantial potential to reduce contamination, facilitate eventual decommissioning,
and minimize generation of radioactive waste if special consideration is given to these issues when designing new
facilities. Therefore, &sect;20.1408(a) has been retained.

 Those submitting written comments mostly agreed with not establishing a separate standard for radon. Commenters
noted, however, that sites contaminated with radon-bearing-or-producing materials may have great difficulty
meeting the proposed dose goal and limit in the staff's draft.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission believes that a separate standard for radon is not needed and that NRC guidance being issued in support
of the rulemaking will provide licensees with sufficient information concerning measurement problems that are
associated with background radon. Additional comments are invited with respect to the problem of determining compliance
with the NRC's radiological criteria at sites contaminated with processed radon-bearing-or-producing materials.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There were a number of questions concerning definition of terms used in the draft rule. There were also several suggestions
for additions, deletions, or revisions to existing definitions in the draft rule, and there were some suggested new
definitions. Questions were raised concerning the use of terms such as, ``affected parties,'' ``significant,''
``average member,'' ``cumulative TEDE,'' ``decommissioning goal,'' ``unrestricted use,'' and ``net public or
environmental harm.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters objected to including fallout in the definition of background radiation. Others agreed with the
proposed definition or proposed various additions, revisions, or deletions to the definition, e.g., to change the
wording starting with the current words ``global fallout'' to ``global fallout from the testing of nuclear explosive
devices or from past nuclear accidents.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters said that the term ``residual radioactivity'' needs clarification with respect to materials
discharged from the site in accordance with other provisions of the regulations in 10 CFR Part 20. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The practical implication of these terms and others in the proposed rule have been clarified in the guidance which
accompanies the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to ``background radiation,'' the new definition is the same as the existing definition except for the
addition of the words ``or from past nuclear accidents like Chernobyl which contribute to background radiation and
are not under the control of the licensee'' after ``explosive devices'' in order to explicitly recognize that radioactivity
from past nuclear accidents contributes to background radiation. Because the remaining wording has been adequate
in the past, the Commission sees no reason to further revise the definition at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission agrees that the proposed definition of ``residual radioactivity'' in &sect;20.1003 was not clear
with respect to materials discharged at the site in accordance with other provisions of 10 CFR Part 20. The definition
has been revised to clarify the Commission's intent.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Rationale for the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Conceptual Basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The overall conceptual basis for decommissioning, as proposed in this rulemaking, consists of an objective to reduce
the residual radioactivity at the site so that it is indistinguishable from the background, a limit on the dose considered
acceptable for release of a site with a stipulation that dose be as far below this limit as reasonably achievable (i.e.,
ALARA), provisions in regulatory guidance for administrative relief from performing sophisticated ALARA analyses
for licensees who have little or no site contamination, provisions for restricted termination of a license when physical
remediation activities cannot achieve the limit, and enhanced provisions for public participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limit for release of a site is 15 mrem/y (0.15 mSv/y) TEDE for residual radioactivity distinguishable from background.
If doses from residual radioactivity are less than 15 mrem/y TEDE, the Commission will terminate the license and authorize
release of the site for unrestricted use following the licensee's demonstration that the residual radioactivity
at the site is ALARA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission expects the licensee to make every reasonable effort to reduce residual radioactivity to levels that
will allow unrestricted release of the site. However, the Commission will consider terminating a license in cases
where restrictions must be imposed on the use of the site to ensure that public doses are maintained below the 15 mrem/y
(0.15 mSv/y) TEDE limit, provided the licensee: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Can demonstrate that further reductions in residual radioactivity necessary to comply with the 15 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
&blank;mrem/y TEDE limit for unrestricted use are not technically achievable, would be prohibitively expensive,
or would result in net public or environmental harm; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Has made adequate provisions for institutional controls to reduce annual TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable
from background to the average member of the appropriate critical group to 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume and carry out responsibilities
for any necessary control and maintenance of the site; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Has reduced the residual radioactivity at the site so that the TEDE from residual radioactivity would not exceed
100 mrem (1 mSv) per year even if the restrictions applied in the termination were no longer effective in limiting the
possible scenarios or pathways of exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission estimates that there may be several existing licensed sites (no more than a few tens) containing large
quantities of materials contaminated with low level radioactivity where health and environment may best be protected
by onsite stabilization and disposal. The contamination was generated over the last several decades using practices
that generally would not be found satisfactory today without adequate plans and financial assurance for decommissioning.
In some cases, a responsible public or private entity may no longer exist or be viable for discharging its responsibility
for ensuring protection of the public and the environment. In other cases, the contamination may have been generated
through research or development contracts with the Federal government or given special consideration in Federal
law. Due to the unique characteristics of these sites when compared with the much larger population of licensed nuclear
facilities, the Commission contemplates that the owners and operators of these facilities may seek exemptions from
the decommissioning criteria under the general provisions in 10 CFR 20.2301. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such sites, and the considerations associated with them, are not unlike disposal sites for uranium mill tailings,
and may need to be provided with equivalent types of controls to ensure sufficient protection. At a minimum, the Commission
would require that the public health and environmental protection requirements developed for these unique cases
be consistent with other appropriate regulatory requirements for disposal of radioactive waste, including those
in 10 CFR Part 61 ``Licensing Requirements for Land Disposal of Radioactive Waste'' or 10 CFR Part 40, Appendix A ``Criteria
Relating to the Operation of Uranium Mills and the Disposition of Tailings or Wastes Produced by the Extraction or
Concentration of Source Material from Ores Processed Primarily for their Source Material Content.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any Commission decision on such exemption requests and the disposition of these sites would be made on the basis of
a comprehensive analysis of the risks and benefits of all viable alternatives including remediation of the site to
meet the criteria in this rule. Proper disposition of these sites may require some type of durable institutional control,
such as placing the site under the custody of a State or Federal agency, to ensure long-term protection of the public
and environment. For example, for a former licensed site in West Virginia, the final disposition included action
by Congress that provided for transfer of the site to Federal custody and ongoing DOE oversight. Such an analysis would
have to consider all significant risks to humans and the environment resulting from the decommissioning process
(including transportation and disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the process) and from residual radioactivity
remaining at the site following termination of the license. The Commission specifically solicits comments on this
approach to the handling of these unique cases, including proposals for alternative strategies which could be used
to assure adequate protection of public health and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission envisions that the scope of the exemption request would be limited to the radiological criteria for
unrestricted or restricted release. Due to the unique nature of these sites and the comprehensive evaluation necessary
to support such an exemption request, the Commission would require that a meaningful and substantial process be used
by the licensee or the NRC itself for informing and involving the public in the decision. Consequently, the Commission
would not favorably entertain exemption requests unless they were developed through a process consistent with the
public involvement processes required in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For any process conducted by the NRC, the Commission would solicit participation from: the Environmental Protection
Agency; local and State governments; persons residing in the vicinity of the site; citizen, environmental, environmental
justice, and other public interest groups; Indian Nation or other indigenous people that have treaty or statutory
rights that could be affected; and other affected parties. For example, in reviewing proposed decommissioning actions
at two licensed sites in Ohio and New Jersey, the Commission has initiated development of Environmental Impact Statements
(EISs) for both sites and recently held public meetings on the scope of the EISs with the intent to fully explore the
alternatives and potential impacts associated with the disposal of the contaminated material. As a part of this process,
NRC is working closely with EPA, State, local representatives, and members of the public to develop acceptable alternatives.
The site-specific process applied at these sites by the NRC is attempting to include participation by all affected
parties to assure continued protection of public health and safety through a viable and effective decommissioning
approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Commission recognizes there may be existing sites where public health and the environment may best be
protected by onsite stabilization and disposal, the Commission does not believe that future activities should result
in additional sites that would not be able to meet the criteria in this rule. Therefore, the Commission is proposing
to add a new &sect;20.1408 to its regulations which would require that applicants for licenses, other than renewals,
describe in the application how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of the
facility and the environment, facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive
waste.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following definitions already present in the regulations would be revised: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of Background Radiation (10 CFR 20.1003) would be revised so that fallout from past nuclear accidents
like Chernobyl which contribute to background radiation and are not under the control of the licensee are included
in the definition. The Commission does not believe it is reasonable for licensees to be required to remediate material
over which they have no control and which is present at comparable levels in the environment both on and off of the site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of Decommission would be revised to also provide for termination of a license and release of property
under restricted conditions. This revision was requested by a large number of commenters at the workshops on decommissioning.
Those commenters felt that the NRC should recognize that it may not be feasible to decontaminate some sites to a level
appropriate for unrestricted use and that restrictions on the subsequent use of such sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be used to provide an additional measure of public protection.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following new definitions would be added: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Critical Group would be defined as the group of individuals reasonably expected to receive the greatest exposure
to residual radioactivity given the circumstances under which the analysis would be carried out. For example, if
the site were to be released for unrestricted use the Critical Group would be the group of individuals reasonably expected
to be the most highly exposed considering all reasonable potential future uses of the site. This would include renovation
of structures, water use, and industrial, residential, and agricultural uses of the land and structures. If the site
were to be released with restrictions, the licensee would have to assess both the dose to the average member of the group
of individuals reasonably expected to be the most highly exposed assuming that the proposed restrictions were successfully
imposed and adhered to (the ``Critical Group'' appropriate to this set of circumstances) and the dose to the average
member of the group of individuals reasonably expected to be the most highly exposed if the proposed restrictions
were to fail (in essence the ``Critical Group'' for unrestricted termination of the license). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Critical Group, for purposes of screening dose calculations, is defined for each scenario described in NUREG/CR&hyph;5512,
Volume 1. In each scenario, the Critical Group is an individual or relatively homogeneous group of individuals expected
to receive the highest exposure within the assumptions of the particular scenario. The average member of the Critical
Group is that individual who is assumed to represent the most likely exposure situation based on prudently conservative
exposure assumptions and parameter values within the model calculations. For example, the Critical Group for the
building occupancy scenario is the group of workers occupying a building that has been decontaminated. The average
member of that group is assumed to spend 2000 hours per year working in the building and is exposed to residual contamination
via the external, inhalation, and inadvertent ingestion pathways. A more detailed discussion of acceptable methods
for selecting the critical group and estimating the dose to the average member of the group can be found in Section III.G.
of the draft regulatory guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is a departure from the requirement in &sect;20.1302 where, for licensed activities, the licensee is required
to assess the dose to ``the individual likely to receive the highest dose.'' However, in contrast to licensed facilities
where public doses normally result from activities that are carefully prescribed and controlled, the public doses
from residual radioactivity at decommissioned sites may result from a variety of activities for which the maximally
exposed individual is much more difficult to precisely define. Furthermore, in ongoing operations licensed by the
Commission, it is possible to update or keep track of who might be likely to receive the highest exposure. In decommissioning,
there will be no ongoing mechanism that would allow for adjustments of imposition of additional controls. Therefore,
the Commission believes it is more prudent to use the average member of the critical group for assessing TEDE from residual
radioactivity after the license is terminated because this provides a reasonably conservative estimate of public
risk without attempting to speculate on which specific individual may be expected to receive the highest dose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The practice of defining and using a Critical Group when assessing individual public dose from low levels of radioactivity
similar to those expected from a decommissioned site is proposed in Section 5.5.1 of the 1990 recommendations of the
International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP 60) and has been adopted in the current draft of the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) Draft Federal Radiation Protection Guidance for Exposure of the General Public. For the
purpose of this Subpart, the licensee would be required to estimate the dose to the average member of the critical group
from residual radioactivity remaining at the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indistinguishable from background would mean that the detectable concentration of the radionuclide is not statistically
different from the background concentration of that radionuclide in the vicinity of the site, or in the case of structures,
in similar materials using adequate measurement technology, survey methodology, and statistical techniques.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Readily removable would refer to residual radioactivity, as defined below, which is removable using non-destructive,
common, housekeeping techniques (e.g., washing with detergent and water) that do not generate large volumes of radioactive
waste requiring subsequent disposal. This would not include techniques that produce chemical wastes that are expected
to adversely affect public health or the environment. Readily removable would also not refer to residual contamination
dispersed in soil under conditions where removal of the residual radioactivity could only be accomplished by moving
large volumes of soil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Residual Radioactivity would include radioactivity in structures, materials, soils, groundwater, and other media
at the site resulting from licensed activities at the site. This would include radioactivity from all licensed and
unlicensed sources used by the licensee but would exclude background radiation. This term should not be confused
with the term ``residual radioactive material'' which appears in 10 CFR 40.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Site-Specific Advisory Board (SSAB) would be a committee constituted by the licensee to provide advice to the licensee
on decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would apply to the decommissioning of all facilities licensed by the Commission except for facilities
or portions thereof (e.g., waste disposal sites and uranium mill tailings) that are already specifically covered
in the regulations. It provides for both unrestricted and restricted release of sites. The proposed rule would not
apply to sites already covered by a Commission approved decommissioning plan if the plan was approved before the effective
date of the rule. This provision is designed to encourage licensees to continue with ongoing and planned decommissioning.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a site has been decommissioned and the license terminated in accordance with the criteria in this proposed rule,
the Commission would require additional cleanup only if, based on new information, it determines that residual radioactivity
remaining at the site could result in significant public or environmental harm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes there may be existing sites containing large quantities of materials contaminated with
low level radioactivity where public health and the environment may best be protected by onsite stabilization and
disposal with proper restriction of the site to prevent human disruption of the site and exposure to the radioactive
contamination. There are precedents for these cases in the stabilization of uranium mill tailings under the Uranium
Mill Tailings Remediation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA) and the DOE Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program
(FUSRAP). In these cases, some type of durable institutional control, such as placing the site under the custody of
a State or Federal agency, may be necessary to ensure long-term protection of the public and the environment. However,
consideration of these actions would require extensive site-specific safety and environmental analyses. In addition,
input from affected parties in the vicinity of the site would be desirable to determine whether there are other local
impacts that must be considered in determining the best course of action and to ensure the long-term effectiveness
of the institutional controls. For these reasons, the Commission has determined that these actions fall outside
the scope of this rulemaking in the sense that there may be site-specific determinations using criteria other than
those proposed in this rulemaking. If, in the future, general criteria to evaluate these actions can be developed,
the Commission will consider additional rulemaking to establish the criteria for general application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also require that all new applicants for licenses, other than renewals, describe in the application
how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of the facility and the environment,
facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Radiological Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would establish a dose limit for release of a decommissioned site of 15 millirem per year (mrem/y)
TEDE for residual radioactivity distinguishable from background. The 15 mrem/y TEDE dose limit was selected to provide
both a substantial margin of safety below the NRC's dose limit for members of the public and an appropriate limit for
the acceptability of release of a facility which would no longer be subject to regulatory control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated lifetime risk associated with an annual TEDE of 15 mrem/y is approximately 4E&hyph;4. This estimate
was arrived at by using a risk coefficient of 4E&hyph;4 per rem and assuming an exposure lifetime of 70 years. The 4E&hyph;4
risk factor is roughly equivalent to the 3.92E&hyph;4 risk factor in Table 6.6 of the EPA NESHAPS Background Information
Document (EPA89). Use of this value is consistent with the calculational methods of the Environmental Protection
Agency which is also promulgating regulations in this area. The 70-year exposure lifetime provides a conservative
estimate of lifetime exposure. The Environmental Protection Agency is using a 30-year lifetime exposure in estimating
lifetime risk from residual radioactivity at decommissioned sites. This is based on the assumption that it is unlikely
that an individual will continue to live or work in the same area for more than 30 years. Using a 30-year exposure lifetime
the estimated lifetime risk associated with an annual TEDE of 15 mrem/y would be approximately 2E&hyph;4. A more detailed
discussion of estimating lifetime risk can be found in appendix B of the GEIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In selecting this limit, the NRC staff took into account recommendations of the ICRP and NCRP and those criteria promulgated
by EPA and NRC which provide acceptance criteria for areas where unrestricted access in the vicinity of facilities
is permitted, such as generally applicable environmental standards established by EPA and the criteria used for
remediation of contaminated sites under the Superfund (CERCLA) program. The dose value of 15 mrem/y TEDE is generally
consistent with the risks implied by those criteria and with the remediations which have been achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters have argued that a 15 mrem/y limit for unrestricted release is not consistent with the recommendations
of the ICRP and NCRP and that the limit should be raised to as high as 100 mrem/y. The Commission believes that an additional
margin of safety below 100 mrem/yr is necessary because the 100 mrem/y limit is intended to apply to doses to the public
resulting from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 radiation sources (NCRP Report No. 116, Section 15; ICRP Publication 60, Section 5.5). Therefore, allocation of
the entire 100 mrem/y dose to residual radioactivity from the decommissioning of a single facility would be inappropriate.
Using a safety margin to limit the dose from a single source to avoid a summation of exposures approaching the dose limit
is consistent with the recommendations of both the ICRP and the NCRP.

In addition, the cost/benefit impact analysis in the GEIS (Chapters 5 and 6 and Figures 7&hyph;1 through 7&hyph;11)
indicate that costs of achieving a 15 mrem/yr limit would not be unduly burdensome on licensees. In those few cases
where remediation to achieve 15 mrem/yr may present an unreasonable burden, release of the site with restrictions
placed on its use provides an alternative means for achieving this level of protection.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would also require that the licensee reduce any residual radioactivity to as close to indistinguishable
from background as reasonably achievable. ALARA considerations are to include all significant risks to humans and
the environment resulting from the decommissioning process, and licensees are to demonstrate why further reductions
below the limit are not reasonably achievable. Depending on the site-specific ALARA analysis, any dose level less
than or equal to 15 mrem/y may be considered ALARA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in many situations, licensees who have little or no site contamination should be able to readily achieve
a dose level well below the limit. The NRC will provide guidance as to how such licensees can demonstrate compliance
with &sect;20.1404(a)(ii) without having to perform sophisticated analyses to demonstrate that residual radioactivity
levels at their sites are ALARA. This should substantially reduce the administrative burden on licensees who have
little or no site contamination (e.g., licensees that use only sealed sources or short lived radioisotopes). There
are approximately 17,000 NRC and Agreement State licensees, many of which are small businesses, that are expected
to benefit from this guidance without any compromise to public health and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that demonstrating that radionuclide levels at a site are indistinguishable from background
is a complex task involving sophisticated sampling, measuring, and statistical analysis techniques. The difficulty
of the task can vary substantially depending on a number of factors including the radionuclide in question, the background
level for that and other radionuclides at the site, and the temporal and spatial variations in background radiation
at the site. Therefore, in order to assist the licensee in making these determinations, the Commission will publish
specific guidance on acceptable methods which can be used by the licensee to demonstrate that the concentrations
of specific isotopes at the site are indistinguishable from background. The Commission will also publish guidance
on acceptable methods for estimating annual TEDE to the average member of the Critical Group. This guidance will include
a discussion of the type of scenarios and exposure pathways which should be considered, and computer models for estimating
the annual TEDE to the average member of the critical group. The computer models will be screening models that employ
generically derived conservative assumptions and factors. However, licensees will be able to substitute assumptions
and factors more appropriate to a particular site if they can demonstrate that these factors and assumptions reasonably
reflect the existing and projected conditions at the site. Licensees may also use other models or methods for estimating
TEDE, provided they can demonstrate to the Commission that these models or methods provide reasonable estimates
for the site to be decommissioned. This guidance is described in NUREG&hyph;1500 ``Working Draft Regulatory Guide
on Release Criteria for Decommissioning; Staff Draft for Comment.'' The Commission requests comment on the appropriateness
of the approach and the methodology described in NUREG&hyph;1500. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As can be seen from Figures 7&hyph;1 through 7&hyph;11 of the GEIS, it appears reasonable to expect that a number of
licensees will be able to remediate their sites to dose levels below the 15 mrem/yr limit at reasonable cost. However,
these same analyses indicate that in most cases there are large incremental costs associated with reductions below
3 mrem/yr, and that the incremental costs are due primarily to the cost of demonstrating compliance rather than the
cost of additional remediation. Therefore, when attempting to achieve doses below 3 mrem/y, costs can increase substantially
with little or no additional reduction in risk to public health or the environment. Section 7&hyph;5 of the GEIS also
indicates that levels of residual radioactivity which produces a dose of 3 mrem/yr are generally difficult to distinguish
from natural background because they are comparable to local variations in background radiation and substantially
smaller than national variations in background radiation. As a result, the staff draft regulatory guide (NUREG&hyph;1500)
proposes that, in order to minimize the burden of documentation and analysis in such cases, the Commission would consider
documentation that the TEDE to the average member of the critical group from all radionuclides distinguishable from
background does not exceed 3 mrem/y as sufficient for demonstrating compliance with the ALARA requirement. The Commission
invites comment on this provision in the guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would broaden the definition of decommissioning to include release for restricted use in addition
to release for unrestricted use. The underlying approach for restricted release is that the risk for a member of the
public should be limited to acceptable levels, irrespective of whether that individual is exposed during the conduct
of some occupation or in residential or recreational activities. Thus, the conditions for restricted release are
premised on restricting the use of the site so that average individual doses do not exceed the 15 mrem/yr dose limit.
While the circumstances of the exposure (i.e., the duration or pathway) may thus be varied, the underlying risk limit
remains respected for any critical group of individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Licensees unable to meet the requirements for unrestricted use would be allowed to request permission to release
sites for restricted use with subsequent termination of the license if they can demonstrate that the following conditions
have been met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Further reductions in residual radioactivity are not technically achievable, the cost of achieving further
reductions would be prohibitively expensive, or further reductions would directly produce environmental or public
harm that is clearly excessive compared to the health or environmental benefits achieved through these reductions
now or in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has proposed this provision as the fundamental basis for determining when a restricted termination
of a license will be appropriate. Technical achievability, prohibitive expenses, and excessive environmental
or public harm are the three areas in which the Commission believes that alternative considerations should be examined
as part of the overall process of determining the most appropriate action for a site. Clearly, if remediation is simply
not possible given the technological capabilities in existence at the time of decommissioning, some other types
of alternatives must be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In terms of excessive costs, the Commission recognizes that there may be situations where removal and disposal of
large quantities of material is simply not reasonable from a cost standpoint. An example of this type of situation
that has already been addressed is the disposal of mill tailings, where a separate set of standards has been developed,
including provisions for institutional control. The third condition, excessive environmental or public harm,
has been included in recognition that although remediations may be technically possible and within the overall resources
of society, the net damage, through removal and disposal of materials, alteration of ecosystems, or displacement
of populations, could be too great to not be undertaken. Considerations of this nature are best determined through
public participation, which is provided through provisions for a Site-Specific Advisory Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third condition also provides for the possibility that the net environmental impact of completely remediating
a site and then constructing an entirely new site to perform a similar activity may be inappropriate. An example of
this could be the continued use of a site for electrical power generation, where a number of existing facilities, such
as the turbine and electrical distribution system could be used with a different energy source. This approach would
need to be examined on a case-by-case basis, and a determination made regarding the appropriateness of remediating
the site for unrestricted use vs some type of restricted use in order to conserve environmental resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There are adequate provisions for institutional and/or other passive controls to provide reasonable assurance
that the TEDE from residual radioactivity to the average member of the critical group will not exceed 15 mrem (0.15
mSv) per year. Institutional controls would have to be enforceable by a responsible Government entity or in a court
of law in response to suits by affected parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision specifies the fundamental dose limit for considerations of restricted termination. The core requirement
is that an individual should not be exposed to a greater level of risk than that established for unrestricted use releases.
Thus, the application of restrictions must be able to reduce the average dose to the appropriate critical group to
the same 15 mrem/year value used as the limit for unrestricted use. However, in the restricted use situation, the critical
group will be different from the critical group that would need to be considered in the unrestricted situation. For
example, a restriction might be imposed that would prevent residential applications or agricultural uses of the
facility. These restrictions would mean that critical group would have different exposure characteristics (e.g.,
8 hours per day while working in a building) and thus, a larger quantity of radioactivity could be allowed to remain
onsite for the same dose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) There is sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume and carry out responsibilities
for any necessary control and maintenance of the site. Acceptable financial assurance mechanisms will include:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Prepayment as described &sect;30.35(f)(1); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(iii) Statement of intent in the case of Federal, State, or local government licensees, as described in &sect;30.35(f)(4).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision has been included to assure that mechanisms have been established as necessary to ensure the continued
effectiveness of the controls that may be used to meet the dose limit. The ongoing effectiveness of the restrictions
will not necessarily be the responsibility of the former licensee but could be vested in other organizations, local
governments, etc., which would continue cognizance of the action. This responsibility could include periodic monitoring,
overviews of site access restrictions, or other activities that might be necessary to support the proposed controls.
Under this provision, the amount of financial assurance that would be needed will be determined on a site-specific
basis, taking into account the proposed restrictions, and the recommendations of the Site-Specific Advisory Board.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Residual radioactivity at the site has been reduced so that if the site were released for unrestricted use, the
TEDE from residual radioactivity to the average member of the critical group is as low as reasonably achievable and
would not reasonably be expected to exceed 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year. This limit coincides with the NRC dose limit for
public exposure in 10 CFR Part 20. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final condition is premised on the assumption that circumstances could develop under which the restrictions,
such as land use or deed restrictions, might no longer be effective in limiting the exposure scenarios. If, for example,
a restriction against residential or agricultural use were no longer effective in preventing those uses of the land,
then the assumptions about the exposure of the critical group would no longer be valid. While this is not assumed to
occur for planning purposes, the Commission believes it is appropriate to have a ``safety net'' to prevent exposures
in excess of the public dose limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of this provision also has the effect of requiring that some remediation be conducted at the site,
rather than simply allowing a licensee to develop a series of restrictions. The Commission believes it appropriate
that basic measures be taken to reduce the risk and dose that could result from a site and that the public dose limits
form the minimum acceptable level of protection that should be provided in the unlikely event that restrictions are
not effective in reducing the magnitude and scenarios of exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission specifically solicits public comment on the adequacy of the 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year value as the ``safety
net'' to prevent exposures in excess of the public dose limits in the event that all site restrictions fail. The recommendations
of the ICRP and NCRP, as well as Draft Federal Guidance being developed by the EPA, suggest constraining the dose to
members of the public from any single source to less than 100 mrem/y as a way to ensure that the total public dose from
all sources does not exceed 100 mrem/y. The Commission has followed this principle in establishing the dose limit
for decommissioning. However, in the case of the ``safety net'', the Commission does not believe that fractionation
would be necessary for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The 100 mrem/y cap, although being equivalent to the dose limit for members of the public, represents a small fraction
of the 500 mrem/y dose that the Draft Federal Guidance suggests is acceptable for members of the public in unusual circumstances.
The Commission believes that failure of all site restrictions at decommissioned sites is a highly unlikely event.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The 100 mrem/y value applies to the peak dose during the first 1000 years. For most radioisotopes, this peak dose
occurs in the first year and diminishes over time due to radioactive decay. This decay provides an additional margin
of safety which is equivalent to an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a priori
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 fractionation of the limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The 100 mrem/y value is less than the value selected for controlling intruder scenarios for other types of facilities
where some type on institutional control (e.g. government ownership) is contemplated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Commission is soliciting suggestions for alternatives to the proposed safety net, including the use
of some fraction of 100 mrem/y (e.g., 75 mrem/y) as the safety net. The Commission is particularly interested in the
relative merits of selecting a fraction of the routine public dose limit in light of the required conservatism in the
calculation of the dose, and the rationale for selecting some particular fraction. The Commission is also soliciting
comments on the relative benefits and impacts of the Commission's proposed safety net and proposed options, including
comments on the number of facilities that could be impacted by selection of alternative values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes there may be unusual circumstances in which the licensee may wish to seek an exemption from
one or more of the provisions of this subpart. For example, the licensee may feel it is unnecessary to clean up a site
to the requirements for unrestricted release because the site is contained within a larger area where use will be restricted
for the foreseeable future. The Commission believes these rare circumstances can adequately be handled under existing
provisions in &sect;20.2301 which provides opportunity for the licensee to request an exemption from any of the provisions
of 10 CFR Part 20. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also recognizes there may be special environmental or cultural issues associated with a particular
decommissioning action which would require more stringent implementation of the requirements in this subpart.
For example, there may be social or cultural issues that have to be considered because the site is on or contiguous to
historical sites or Native American lands which contain religious or sacred areas. However, the Commission believes
these issues can best be handled on a site-by-site basis as part of the licensing process and, in most cases, would be
taken into consideration when establishing ALARA residual radioactivity levels for a site. The Commission does
not believe that further reductions in dose would be necessary to meet social or cultural issues if the limit for unrestricted
use is achieved and ALARA has been applied. Where necessary, the provisions for public comment and for a Site-Specific
Advisory Board will provide a mechanism for local citizens and other affected parties to be directly involved in addressing
these issues.

Public Participation in the Decommissioning Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes it is important for the public to not only be fully informed of the decommissioning actions
at a particular site but also to be able to effectively participate in site decommissioning decisions. The proposed
rule will provide for public participation in the decommissioning process through three mechanisms in addition
to the relevant NRC requirements regarding hearing opportunities for a particular site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon the receipt of a decommissioning plan from the licensee, or a proposal by the licensee for restricted release
of a site pursuant to &sect;20.1405, or whenever the Commission deems such notice to be in the public interest, the
Commission shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Notify and solicit comments from local and State governments in the vicinity of the site and Indian Nation or other
indigenous people that have treaty or statutory rights that could be affected by the decommissioning; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as well as in other media, such as local newspapers, which are readily accessible to individuals in the vicinity of
the site; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Solicit public comment on the proposed decommissioning action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These provisions are designed to provide affected individuals and organizations with both information about the
proposed decommissioning and an opportunity to provide comments on the licensee's proposal. The Commission believes
it is particularly important to provide notice in a forum that is accessible to local individuals. This forum may vary
from site to site but would usually include providing notice to local media for publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For decommissioning where the licensee does not propose to meet the conditions for unrestricted release, the proposed
rule would require that the licensee convene a Site-Specific Advisory Board (SSAB) as described in &sect;20.1407
for the purpose of obtaining advice from affected parties regarding the proposed decommissioning. The purpose of
the SSAB would be to provide recommendations to the licensee on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether there are ways to reduce residual radioactivity to a level necessary to comply with the provisions of &sect;20.1404
which are technically achievable, would not be prohibitively expensive, and would not result in net public or environmental
harm; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether provisions for institutional controls proposed by the licensee will: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Provide reasonable assurance that the TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to
the average member of the critical group will not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE per year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Be enforceable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Impose undue burdens on the local community or other affected parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether the licensee has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume
and carry out responsibilities for any necessary control and maintenance of the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The areas in which the SSAB would be expected to provide recommendations parallel the areas that a licensee must address
as part of its proposal for a restricted termination of license. The intent of the provision is to provide a mechanism
for early public involvement in the development of the decommissioning plan for the site. To the extent that local
public involvement may be vital to the successful implementation of land use restrictions, involvement of representatives
of local government, affected citizens, Native Americans, and other interested parties in the Site-Specific Advisory
Board is important to the long-term effectiveness of the decommissioning action. In order for the participation
to be most effective, it should come during the development of the plan, rather than as comment after the licensee has
spent significant resources to develop its proposal. Hence, the recommendations of the SSAB are to be included in
the decommissioning plan along with the licensee's disposition of those recommendations. It is important to note
that the opportunity for comment provisions would still be applicable even when a SSAB had been used in the development
of the decommissioning plan.

Site-Specific Advisory Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SSAB has been patterned after the recommendations contained in the Interim Report of the Federal Facilities Environmental
Restoration Dialog Committee (FFERDC) entitled ``Recommendations For Improving the Federal Facilities Environmental
Restoration Decision-Making and Priority Setting Processes, February 1993,'' which is a consensus document developed
by over 40 members of a committee chartered by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The diverse members
of the FFERDC represented Federal, Tribal, State, environmental, labor, and citizen interests. It is designed to
respond to the desire expressed by many workshop commenters that local affected parties have early and substantive
input into the decommissioning process on a site-specific basis. The SSAB would supplement and not supplant existing
NRC procedures that provide for public input into the regulatory process. The Commission believes that increasing
the opportunity for early public involvement in the decommissioning process is an effective way to provide an information
exchange and to ensure credible and defensible licensing decisions, especially when the long-term effectiveness
of the land use restrictions may depend on community knowledge and involvement in their development and application.
The Commission would emphasize that the operation of the SSAB is not intended to usurp the traditional land use authority
of the local or State government. In fact, many of the institutional controls that may be recommended by an SSAB to ensure
the restricted use of a site will depend on the exercise of this traditional authority by the local or State government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Licensee notification to the Commission of intent to decommission in accordance with &sect;&sect;30.36(b), 40.42(b),
50.82(a), 70.38(b) or 72.54 would have to specify whether the licensee intends to reduce residual radioactivity
at the site to levels which would allow the site to be released for unrestricted use. If not, the licensee would be required
to submit a plan for establishing and supporting an SSAB with the notification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee would be responsible for establishing the SSAB and developing appropriate ground rules and operating
procedures for the SSAB with the advice of the SSAB. The SSAB would consist of about 10 members plus an ex officio representative
from the Commission. This number of members is expected to allow for adequate representation of affected parties
without allowing the group to become so large that it cannot perform its function effectively. The licensee would
be required to provide adequate administrative support for SSAB activities and provide the SSAB access to studies
and analyses pertinent to the proposed decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Membership of the SSAB, to the extent that representatives are willing to participate, would have to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reflect the fullest practical range of interests in the affected community and region and be composed primarily
of individuals who could be directly affected by residual radioactivity at the decommissioned site, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Include representatives from the licensee; local and State governments; workers; persons residing in the vicinity
of the site; citizen, environmental, environmental justice, and public interest groups; and Indian Nation or other
indigenous people that have treaty of statutory rights that could be affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meetings of the SSAB would be open to the public. The licensee would be required to provide adequate public notice of
the location, time, date, and agenda for the meetings at least 2 weeks in advance of each meeting. All records generated
or reviewed by the SSAB would become part of the decommissioning docket, and would be available for public inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In most cases it is expected that the work of the SSAB would be completed after it had formally submitted its advice to
the licensee. However, there may be some cases (e.g., where the licensee's plan is substantially altered following
NRC review) in which the SSAB may have a continuing role in providing advice to the licensee. In any case, it is anticipated
that the SSAB would be dissolved after the license has been terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking comment on whether there are situations where it might be inappropriate or infeasible to
establish an SSAB under conditions set forth in &sect;20.1406(b). For example, are there situations where establishment
of an SSAB would be inconsistent with other governmental regulations and statutes, or are there circumstances in
which local government officials may not be allowed to participate in privately funded advisory groups. If so, what
alternatives would be available to satisfy the objectives of public participation and input? Should criteria be
incorporated in the regulation for granting exemptions to the requirements of &sect;20.1406(b) for good cause.
If so, what criteria might be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also seeking comment on what the content of descriptive information on membership, size, operating
procedures, administrative support, and distribution of agendas should include, and whether this information
should be included in the rule or in a regulatory guide or other document.

Readily Removable Residual Radioactivity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is clear that some structures can easily be decontaminated to levels well below those necessary to reduce individual
doses from residual radioactivity at a decommissioned site to a few mrem TEDE/y above background. Past decommissioning
practice has been based on the premise that ``the licensee should make a reasonable effort to eliminate residual radioactivity.''
See Regulatory Guide 1.86, ``Termination of Operating Licenses for Nuclear Reactors,'' June 1974, pg. 3. Some previously
released structures have been decontaminated to levels below those specified in Regulatory Guide 1.86 for some nuclides.
Therefore, the Commission proposes to require that all readily removable residual radioactivity be removed from
a site before it is decommissioned. This is considered a necessary and reasonable step toward ensuring that doses
to the public from residual radioactivity are ALARA. For the purpose of this proposed regulation, the Commission
has defined readily removable to mean removable using non-destructive, common, housekeeping techniques (e.g.,
washing with moderate amounts of detergent and water) that do not generate large volumes of radioactive waste requiring
subsequent disposal. This would not include techniques that produce chemical wastes that are expected to adversely
affect public health or the environment. It would also not include removal and transport of soil except when small
discreet areas of contamination can be removed by digging up a few shovelfuls of soil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of these proposed provisions is to define the basic types of remediation that should be undertaken as a matter
of good practice regardless of whether the site meets the NRC residual radioactivity criteria. However, it is not
the Commission's intent to require more substantive remediation without the benefit of careful planning and ALARA
considerations. The Commission specifically solicits comments on how to best define the activities that should
be included under this provision.

Radioactive Materials Previously Disposed of at the Site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under NRC regulations, licensees may dispose of radioactive wastes on their own property. Before 1981, NRC regulations
(10 CFR 20.304) allowed disposal without prior approval of limited quantities of specified nuclides under prescribed
conditions. On July 28, 1981, &sect;20.304 was revoked because the Commission did not have sufficient assurance
that these disposals would be adequately protective. However, onsite disposal can still be undertaken by individual
licensees under 10 CFR 20.2002 (previously &sect;20.302), provided the disposal is specifically approved by the
NRC or an Agreement State. If this buried radioactive material is considered to be part of the licensee's total site
inventory for decommissioning purposes, some licensees will likely be required to remove all or part of this material
before decommissioning the site. This position may be controversial because it can be argued that materials already
disposed of in accordance with existing NRC requirements should no longer be considered part of the licensees inventory
of radioactive material. Nevertheless, removal of the previous burials may be necessary to achieve the proposed
radiological criteria and ensure sufficient protection of the public and environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proposed rulemaking, the Commission takes the position that public and environmental risk is the overriding
factor. Therefore all residual radioactivity at the site, including that previously disposed of in accordance with
NRC requirements in &sect;&sect;20.304, 20.302, and 20.2002 must be included in determining whether the licensee
meets the radiological criteria in the proposed rule. However, the Commission is aware that the balancing of risks,
costs, and benefits may be substantially different for exhuming buried material than they would be for decontamination
of surface soils and structures. Therefore, it is expected that before any decision is made to exhume radioactive
material previously disposed of at a site, the licensee will perform a site-specific analysis of the overall risks,
costs, and benefits of this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This position is consistent with positions already taken by the NRC on this issue. In the Supplementary Information
to the Final Rule ``General Requirements for Decommissioning Nuclear Facilities'' (published on June 27, 1988,
53 FR 24021), the Commission states it will ``take a hard look at the extent to which the site has been used to dispose
of low level radioactive wastes by land burial, and will decide what remedial measures including removal of such wastes
offsite, are appropriate before the site can be released for unrestricted use.'' In the Site Decommissioning Management
Plan (SDMP) the NRC staff notes that ``disposals performed under 10 CFR 20.304 have at several sites required exhumation
during the decommissioning and takes the position that acceptability of these burials will be assessed in future
decommissioning procedures.'' See SECY&hyph;91&hyph;096, Enclosure 1 ``Site Decommissioning Management Program,
Revision 1 (January 1991)'' p. 16. See also, the draft Regulatory Guide on ``Standard Format and Content for Decommissioning
Plans for Nuclear Reactors,'' which states that the licensee's plan should indicate the extent of waste burial onsite
and the remedial measures appropriate before the site can be released for unrestricted use.

Use of Actual Measurements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Commission recognizes that it will be necessary in many cases for the licensee to use modeling to estimate
the TEDE to the average member of the critical group from residual radioactivity at the site, the proposed rule would
require that estimates of the site specific source term (i.e., residual radioactivity remaining at the site) be substantiated
using actual measurements to the maximum extent practical. The reason for this substantiation of estimates is that
using actual measurements reduces the uncertainty associated with the estimates and provides a greater measure
of assurance that radiological requirements are being met. It is expected that substantiation would be carried out
in accordance with the survey requirements in 10 CFR 20.1501. Information and guidance related to surveys and use
of measurement techniques have been published in draft form for public comment as NUREG/CR&hyph;5849. An NRC staff
working draft regulatory guide is being published with this proposed rulemaking which specifically addresses these
topics. The Commission plans to publish further guidance in draft form before the effective date of the final rule.

Time Frame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is some difference of opinion on how far into the future calculations should be carried out for the purpose of
establishing acceptable residual radioactivity levels for decommissioned sites. Current NRC staff practice is
to calculate projected doses out to 1,000 years in the future in evaluating radiological impacts associated with
residual radioactivity. This is consistent with current DOE practice. See, Order DOE 5400.5 ``Radiation Protection
of the Public and Environment.'' EPA's high level waste regulations require that cumulative releases to the environment
be calculated out to 10,000 years. See, 40 CFR part 191 (Note: 40 CFR part 191 was remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit in July 1987, and is being reconsidered by EPA.) However, there are some who think such calculations
should be carried out to provide estimates of potential contamination of groundwater for tens or even hundreds of
thousands of years into the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When predicting thousands of years into the future, uncertainties become very large because of major potential changes
in the hydrogeologic regime at the site over these long periods of time. When the potential consequences of exposure
to the radioactive source are great; e.g., as in the case of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high-level waste repository, distant future calculations may provide some insight concerning the relative magnitude
of consequences. However, the consequences of exposure to residual radioactivity at levels near background are
small, and considering the large uncertainties, long term modeling of near background doses may be virtually meaningless.
In light of this, the Commission does not believe it would serve any useful purpose to attempt to estimate radiation
doses from residual radioactivity thousands of years into the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although theoretical maximum doses for a few isotopic decay chains do not occur for hundreds or thousands of years,
for most radionuclides of interest in decommissioning the peak dose occurs in less than 1,000 years. Therefore, the
Commission proposes to require that TEDE estimates be based on the greatest annual dose expected within the first
1000 years after decommissioning. This annual dose must be interpreted as the TEDE delivered in that year, including
the committed dose equivalent from radionuclides taken into the body during that year. The Commission notes that
a time frame of 1,000 years is also being considered by the EPA, as indicated in the draft regulatory language, discussed
during the NACEPT Meeting in May 1994.

Risk Considerations in ALARA Calculations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters at the workshops on decommissioning stated that all risks should be taken into account when
setting requirements for decommissioning a site. A principal concern was that the Commission, in an attempt to reduce
residual radioactivity levels at a site, would establish cleanup requirements which could result in an overall risk
increase, or in risk transference, rather than risk reduction. For example, in an attempt to clean up a site for decommissioning,
the licensee may increase risk to persons along transportation routes and at the site where the material is finally
disposed by transporting large volumes of debris from the site. In addition, disposal of large quantities of low-level
radioactive debris at licensed low-level waste disposal sites could deplete the capacity of existing sites and ultimately
result in a proliferation of licensed disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission, recognizing the validity of these concerns, proposes to require that the licensee, when determining
ALARA, consider all significant radiation doses and risks resulting from residual radioactivity and the decommissioning
process itself, including transportation and disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the process. This analysis
would be part of the decommissioning plan and would be available for comment by interested parties under the public
participation provisions described earlier in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure compatibility with EPA groundwater standards, the proposed rule requires licensees to remediate
their sites so there is a reasonable expectation that residual radioactivity from the site will not cause the level
of radioactivity in any groundwater that is a current or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential source of drinking water to exceed the limits specified in 40 CFR Part 141 as they exist on the effective date
of this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Groundwater Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 20.1404(d) of the proposed rule would require that licensees demonstrate a reasonable expectation that
residual radioactivity from a decommissioned site will not cause the level of radioactivity in any groundwater that
is a current or potential source of drinking water to exceed the limits specified in 40 CFR Part 141. This provision
is in addition to the overall radiological criterion for unrestricted release in 10 CFR 20.1404(a)(i) that the residual
radioactivity that is distinguishable from background radiation results in a TEDE to the average member of the critical
group that does not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is soliciting comments on the proposed groundwater protection requirement. In particular, the Commission
solicits comments on the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Is a separate standard needed for groundwater when the overall radiological criterion of 15 mrem applies to all
pathways, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Given that natural background is included in 40 CFR 141, and given that for pathways of exposure covered by this rule,
background is excluded, what alternatives exist for reconciling this difference in approach? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Is it appropriate to apply a drinking water standard (``at the tap'') to groundwater in all cases.

Minimization of Contamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters at the workshops on decommissioning expressed the opinion that the Commission should be placing
more emphasis on ensuring that licensed facilities are designed and operated in a way that would minimize the amount
of radioactive contamination generated at the site during its operating lifetime. The Commission is sympathetic
with this view. Therefore, the Commission proposes to require that applicants for licenses, except for renewals,
describe in their applications how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of
the facility and the environment, facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive
waste. This provision is a prospective requirement for new licensees to examine contamination and waste minimization
early in the process of facility design and license approval.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission considers that under existing regulations it is reasonable to expect new licensees, other than renewals,
to provide for ease of decommissioning and minimization of waste when designing and operating facilities. However,
given past experience, the Commission believes that this new requirement is necessary to focus applicant's attention
on the type of facility design and good housekeeping practices needed to minimize the types of problems the Commission
has had to face with problem sites like those addressed in the Commission's Site Decommissioning Management Plan
(NUREG&hyph;1444, October 1993).

Timeliness
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission does not want to create a situation where time requirements for completing decommissioning would
make it difficult or impossible for licensees to safely and properly remediate large, complex, or otherwise difficult
to decommission facilities. Therefore, the Commission is requesting comments on whether the criteria contained
in this proposed rule can be met within the time frames that were specified in the final rule on ``Timeliness in Decommissioning
of Materials Facilities.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, the Commission is soliciting comments on whether licensees that anticipate having to establish an
SSAB should be exempted from the generic timeliness requirements. If so, what alternative provisions could be made
to assure timely decommissioning of the site? For example, could licensees be required to provide site-specific
decommissioning schedules during the earliest stages of decommissioning, or during preparation for decommissioning,
e.g., in the decommissioning plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Relationship Between the Generic Environmental Impact Statement and Site-Specific Decommissioning Actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Generic Environmental Impact Statement prepared by the Commission on this rulemaking evaluates the environmental
impacts associated with the remediation of several types of NRC-licensed facilities to residual radioactivity
levels ranging from 100 mrem/yr TEDE down to 0 mrem TEDE (background). The Commission believes that the generic analysis
will encompass the impacts that will occur in any Commission decision to decommission an individual site. Therefore,
the Commission plans to rely on the GEIS to satisfy its obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act in
regard to individual decommissioning decisions that meet the 15 mrem/yr criterion for unrestricted use. However,
the Commission will still initiate a preliminary environmental review in regard to any particular site to determine
if the generic analysis encompasses the range of environmental impacts at that particular site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also provide for the termination of the license and the release of a site under restricted conditions
if the licensee can demonstrate that the use of land use restrictions or other types of institutional controls will
provide reasonable assurance that the 15 mrem/yr limit can be met. The types of controls and their contribution to
providing reasonable assurance that the 15 mrem/yr limit can be met for a particular site will differ for each site
in this category. Therefore, the environmental impacts cannot be analyzed on a generic basis and the Commission will
conduct an independent environmental review for each site-specific decommissioning decision where land use restrictions
or institutional controls are relied on by the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GEIS indicates that the decommissioning of certain classes of licensees (e.g., licensees using only sealed sources)
will not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, for these categories
of licensees, the Commission is proposing to amend 10 CFR Part 51.22 of the Commission's regulations to specify that
the decommissioning of these types of licenses are actions eligible for categorical exclusion from the Commission's
environmental review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of Land Use Restrictions or Other Types of Institutional Controls To Allow Termination of the License and Release
of the Site Under Restricted Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Commission anticipates that most licenses can be terminated for unrestricted use, the Commission also
anticipates that there may be situations where the site radiological criteria can only be met through the use of land
use or other types of institutional controls which will restrict the site to specific uses. For example, there may
be some sites where unrestricted use for agricultural purposes or residential uses would cause the proposed criteria
to be exceeded. However, restricting the same site to industrial or commercial uses would enable the site to meet the
15 mrem/y TEDE dose limit because the exposure pathways would be limited. The licensee, with the advice of the Site
Specific Advisory Board, would propose certain types of land use or institutional controls in the decommissioning
plan submitted for Commission approval, to provide reasonable assurance that the site would be limited to the types
of uses that would enable the proposed criteria to be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of these controls include traditional zoning controls to restrict the use of the site to specific uses, the
imposition of deed restrictions such as restrictive covenants or equitable servitudes to restrict the land to certain
uses, negative easements where the licensee-landowner agrees to restrict the use of the land to specified uses, licensee
agreements to restrict the use of certain portions of the land (for example, restricting access to a particular building),
or even some type of government ownership of the property. Whatever type of controls are proposed by the licensee,
the licensee must demonstrate that the controls proposed have a reasonable expectation of enforcement. A decommissioning
plan that is dependent on land use or institutional controls whose enforcement are speculative would not be approved.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission recognizes that demonstrating that radioisotope levels at a site are indistinguishable from background
may be a complex task involving sophisticated sampling, measuring, and statistical analysis techniques. The difficulty
of the task can vary substantially depending on a number of factors that include the radionuclide in question, the
background level for that and other radionuclides at the site, and the temporal and spatial variations in background
radiation at the site. Therefore, in order to assist the licensee in making these determinations, the Commission
will publish specific guidance on acceptable methods which can be used by the licensee to demonstrate that the concentrations
of specific radionuclides at the site are indistinguishable from background. The Commission will also publish specific
guidance on acceptable methods for estimating annual TEDE to the average member of the Critical Group. This guidance
will include a discussion of the type of scenarios and exposure pathways which should be considered, and computer
models for estimating the annual TEDE to the average member of the critical group. The computer models will include
screening models which employ generically derived conservative assumptions and factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, licensees will be able to substitute assumptions and factors more appropriate to a particular site if they
can demonstrate that these factors and assumptions reasonably reflect the conditions at the site. Licensees may
also use other models or methods for estimating TEDE provided they can demonstrate to the Commission that these models
or methods provide reasonable estimates for the site to be decommissioned. When using modeling to estimate doses
from radioactivity remaining at the site, the licensee will be able to use site specific parameters wherever practical.
In the absence of site-specific information, the licensee must use parameters which provide a sufficient margin
of safety that the Commission can make a finding that there is reasonable assurance the TEDE criteria in this part will
be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An NRC staff working draft regulatory guide will be published simultaneously with the proposed rule as NUREG&hyph;1500,
``Working Draft Regulatory Guide on Release Criteria for Decommissioning: NRC Staff's Draft for Comment.'' This
publication allows licensees and interested members of the public to provide early comment during the developmental
process. The draft regulatory guide has no official regulatory standing. The NRC staff anticipates that the draft
regulatory guide will be published with the final rule and will incorporate public comments and the results of continued
technical development activities. The draft regulatory guide published with the final rule will be for interim use
and comment to fulfill the rule requirements and test implementation options. The final regulatory guide will be
published approximately 1 to 2 years after publication of the final rule and would take into consideration comments
on the draft guide as well as information regarding experience in implementing the draft guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft regulatory guide provides guidance on methods that are acceptable to the NRC staff for determining the predicted
dose level (PDL) from any residual contamination remaining at a facility, that should be compared to the numerical
dose criteria specified in the regulation. It describes the basic features of the calculational models and the associated
default assumptions and parameter values that the NRC staff would find acceptable in calculating PDLs. Appendices
to the guide provide numerical values that are used to estimate the dose from various residual radioactivity levels
remaining at a facility. Also included are the considerations inherent in the ALARA process for decommissioning.
Because the proposed 10 CFR Part 20, Subpart E, introduces several new concepts, a regulatory position concepts section
containing definitions and discussions is included to assist licensees in understanding some of the philosophy
underlying the rule. The regulatory position concepts section is followed by the regulatory position procedures
section that describes actions the licensee can take to implement the requirements of the decommissioning rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has also issued the following supporting documents to provide guidance on implementation of the residual
contamination criteria in the proposed rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) ``Guidance Manual for Conducting Radiological Surveys in Support of License Termination'' (NUREG/CR&hyph;5849),
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Technical Basis Document, ``Residual Radioactive Contamination from Decommissioning: Technical Basis for
Translating Contamination Levels to Annual TEDE'' (NUREG/CR&hyph;5512). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Guidance Manual for Conducting Radiological Surveys is intended to provide licensees with specific guidance
on planning, conducting, and documenting site surveys which could be used to demonstrate that the site has been decontaminated
to a level consistent with the Commission's criteria. The Technical Basis Document would provide an acceptable method
for translating residual radioactivity levels (measurable quantities) to doses to individuals. Generic dose rate
conversion factors are being developed for screening. In addition, the technical basis is expected to include a computer
model which can be used for conducting a screening scenario/pathway analyses with site-specific parameters so that
site-specific dose rate conversion factors can be calculated. The NRC anticipates that in most cases these dose rate
conversion factors could be used to determine compliance with criteria resulting from the rulemaking action.

The Commission currently is developing a new policy on Agreement State compatibility which will be issued for public
comment in the near future. The compatibility determination for the radiological criteria for decommissioning
will be considered in regard to the implementation of the new compatibility policy. Therefore, the Commission believes
that it would be premature to make a proposed compatibility determination on the radiological criteria for decommissioning
at this time. However, for the purpose of facilitating the ultimate resolution of the compatibility determination
for the radiological criteria for decommissioning, the Commission welcomes any comments on this issue. In particular,
the Commission invites comments on to what extent and under what circumstances should an Agreement State be authorized
to establish more stringent requirements than those set forth in NRC radiological criteria for decommissioning.

adopted, will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities. Although the proposed
rule would cover all 22,000 licensees regulated by the NRC and Agreement States, small entities covered by this rule
are primarily licensees that possess and use only materials with short half-lives or materials only in sealed sources.
Decommissioning efforts for these licensees are simple and require only that sealed sources are properly disposed
of or that short-lived materials are allowed to decay. Complete details of the cost analysis are contained in Section
4.5 of the Regulatory Analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although there is no indication that this proposed rule would significantly impact a substantial number of small
entities, the NRC is seeking comments from small entities that may be impacted by the rule. Any small entity subject
to this regulation which determines that, because of its size, it is likely to bear a disproportionate adverse economic
impact should notify the Commission of this in a comment that indicates the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The licensee's size and how the proposed regulation would result in a significant economic burden upon the licensee
as compared to the economic burden on a larger licensee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) How the proposed regulations could be modified to take into account the licensee's differing needs or capabilities;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The benefits that would accrue, or the detriments that would be avoided, if the proposed regulations were modified
as suggested by the licensee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) How the proposed regulation, as modified, would more closely equalize the impact of NRC regulations or create
more equal access to the benefits of Federal programs as opposed to providing special advantages to any individual
or group; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) How the proposed regulation, as modified, would still adequately protect public health and safety.

Backfit Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule and therefore, that
a backfit analysis is not required for this proposed rule because these amendments do not involve any provisions which
would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The criteria in this subpart apply to the decommissioning of facilities licensed under Parts 30, 40, 50, 60, 61,
70, and 72 of this chapter, as well as other facilities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954, as amended, and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended. For high-level and low-level waste
disposal facilities (10 CFR Parts 60 and 61), the criteria apply only to ancillary surface facilities that support
radioactive waste disposal activities. For uranium mills, the criteria apply to decommissioning of the facility
but not to the disposal of uranium mill tailings or to soil cleanup. (See Appendix A of 10 CFR Part 40).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The criteria in this subpart do not apply to sites already covered by a decommissioning plan approved by the Commission
before [insert effective date of rule] and in accordance with the criteria identified in the Site Decommissioning
Management Plan Action Plan of April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13389).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) After a site has been decommissioned and the license terminated in accordance with the criteria in this proposed
rule, the Commission will require additional cleanup only if, based on new information, it determined that residual
radioactivity remaining at the site could result in significant public risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) This subpart also requires that, after the effective date of rule, applicants for licenses, other than renewals,
describe in the application how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of the
facility and the environment, facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive
waste.

 Concepts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The objective of decommissioning is to reduce the residual radioactivity in structures, materials, soils, groundwater,
and other media at the site so that the concentration of each radionuclide that could contribute to residual radioactivity
is indistinguishable from the background radiation concentration for that radionuclide. The Commission realizes
that, as a practical matter, it would be extremely difficult to demonstrate that such an objective has been met. Therefore,
the Commission has established a site release limit and is requiring that licensees demonstrate that the residual
radioactivity at a site is as far below this limit as reasonably achievable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The limit for release of a site is 15 mrem/y (0.15 mSv/y) Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE) to an average member
of the Critical Group for residual radioactivity distinguishable from background. If doses from residual radioactivity
are less than 15 mrem/y TEDE, the Commission will terminate the license and authorize release of the site for unrestricted
use following the licensee's demonstration that the residual radioactivity at the site has been reduced to As Low
As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) ALARA considerations must include all significant risks to humans and the environment resulting from the decommissioning
process. Licensees shall demonstrate why further reductions below the limit are not reasonably achievable. Depending
on the site-specific ALARA analysis, any dose level less than or equal to 15 mrem/y may be considered ALARA. However,
in many situations, licensees may have little or no site contamination and should be able to readily achieve the overall
objective for decommissioning (e.g., licensees that use only sealed sources or short-lived radioisotopes).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Commission expects the licensee to make every reasonable effort to reduce residual radioactivity to levels
that will allow unrestricted release of the site. However, the Commission will consider terminating a license in
cases where restrictions must be imposed on the use of the site to ensure that public doses are maintained below the
15 mrem/y (0.15 mSv/y) TEDE limit, provided the licensee:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Can demonstrate by analysis of the benefits and risks of further reduction that residual radioactivity at the
site is ALARA and that further reductions in residual radioactivity necessary to comply with the 15 mrem/y TEDE limit
for unrestricted use are not technically achievable, would be prohibitively expensive, or would result in net public
or environmental harm;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Has made adequate provisions for institutional controls to reduce annual TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable
from background to the average member of the appropriate critical group to 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume and carry out responsibilities
for any necessary control and maintenance of the site; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Has reduced the residual radioactivity at the site so that the TEDE from residual radioactivity would not exceed
100 mrem (1 mSv) per year even if the restrictions applied in the termination were no longer effective in limiting the
possible scenarios or pathways of exposure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) When calculating TEDE, the licensee shall base estimates on the greatest annual TEDE dose expected within the
first 1000 years after decommissioning. Estimates must be substantiated using actual measurements to the maximum
extent practical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When determining ALARA, the licensee shall consider all significant risks to humans and the environment resulting
from the decommissioning process (including transportation and disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the
process) and from residual radioactivity remaining at the site following termination of the license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) During decommissioning, the licensee shall take reasonable steps to remove all readily removable residual radioactivity
from the site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The licensee shall demonstrate a reasonable expectation that residual radioactivity from the site will not cause
the level of radioactivity in any groundwater that is a current or potential source of drinking water to exceed the
limits specified in 40 CFR Part 141 as they exist on [insert effective date of this regulation].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A site will be considered acceptable for license termination under restricted conditions if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The licensee can demonstrate that further reductions in residual radioactivity necessary to comply with the
provisions of &sect;20.1404 are not technically achievable, would be prohibitively expensive, or would result
in net public or environmental harm; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The licensee has made provisions for institutional controls that provide reasonable assurance that the TEDE
from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to the average member of the critical group will not
exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE per year. Institutional controls must be enforceable by a responsible government entity
or in a court of law in response to suits by affected parties; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The licensee has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume and carry
out responsibilities for any necessary control and maintenance of the site. Acceptable financial assurance mechanisms
are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Funds placed into an account segregated from the licensee's assets and outside the licensee's administrative
control as described in &sect;30.35(f)(1) of this chapter;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Surety method, insurance, or other guarantee method as described in &sect;30.35(f)(2) of this chapter; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A statement of intent in the case of Federal, State, or local government licensees, as described in &sect;30.35(f)(4)
of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Residual radioactivity at the site has been reduced so that if the institutional controls were no longer in effect,
there is reasonable assurance that the TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to the
average member of the critical group would not exceed 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year, and is as low as reasonably achievable.
Calculations used to show compliance with this provision may not assume any benefits from earthen cover or other earthen
barriers unless specifically authorized by the Commission.

(a) Upon the receipt of a decommissioning plan from the licensee, or a proposal by the licensee for restricted release
of a site pursuant to &sect;20.1405, or whenever the Commission deems such notice to be in the public interest, the
Commission shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Notify and solicit comments from local and State governments in the vicinity of the site and any Indian Nation or
other indigenous people that have treaty or statutory rights that could be affected by the decommissioning; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and in a forum, such as local newspapers, which is readily accessible to individuals in the vicinity of the site and
solicit comments from affected parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For decommissioning where the licensee does not propose to meet the conditions for unrestricted release pursuant
to &sect;20.1404 of this part, the licensee shall convene a Site Specific Advisory Board (SSAB) as described in &sect;20.1407
for the purpose of obtaining advice from affected parties regarding the proposed decommissioning.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The SSAB should provide advice to the licensee, as appropriate, on:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether there are ways to reduce residual radioactivity to a level necessary to comply with the provisions of &sect;20.1404
which are technically achievable, would not be prohibitively expensive and would not result in net public or environmental
harm;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether provisions for institutional controls proposed by the licensee:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Will provide reasonable assurance that the TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background
to the average member of the critical group will not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE per year;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Will be enforceable; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Will impose undue burdens on the local community or other affected parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether the licensee has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume
and carry out responsibilities for any necessary control and maintenance of the site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Membership of the SSAB shall to the extent that representatives are willing to participate:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reflect the full range of interests in the affected community and region, and be composed of individuals who could
be directly affected by residual radioactivity at the decommissioned site;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Be selected from individuals nominated by organizations which represent these interests; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Include representatives from the licensee; local and state governments; persons residing in the vicinity of
the site; citizen, environmental, environmental justice, and other public interest groups; and Indian Nation or
other indigenous people that have treaty or statutory rights that could be affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The SSAB shall consist of approximately 10 members plus an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex officio 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
representative selected by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The licensee shall be responsible for establishing the SSAB and the developing of appropriate SSAB operating
procedures with the advice of the SSAB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The licensee shall provide adequate administrative support for SSAB activities and shall provide the SSAB access
to studies and analyses that are readily available to the licensee and are pertinent to the proposed decommissioning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Meetings of the SSAB are open to the public. The licensee shall provide adequate public notice of the location,
time, date, and agenda for the meetings at least 2 weeks in advance of each meeting. All records generated or reviewed
by the SSAB become part of the docket, must be retained by the licensee until the license is terminated, and must be available
for public inspection.
