SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are amending the pink bollworm regulations by adding certain portions of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties in Tennessee
to the list of suppressive areas for pink bollworm and by adding Tennessee to the list of States quarantined because
of pink bollworm. This action will impose restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from those
regulated areas in Dyer and Lauderdale Counties, TN. This action is necessary to prevent the interstate movement
of pink bollworm into noninfested areas.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The pink bollworm, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pectinophora gossypiella
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Saunders), is one of the world's most destructive pests of cotton. This insect spread to the United States from Mexico
in 1917, and now exists throughout most of the cotton-producing States west of the Mississippi River. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pink bollworm regulations, contained in 7 CFR 301.52 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
301.52&hyph;10 (referred to below as the regulations), quarantine certain States and restrict the interstate movement
of regulated articles from regulated areas in quarantined States for the purpose of preventing the spread of pink
bollworm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulated areas for the pink bollworm are designated as either suppressive areas or generally infested areas. Restrictions
are imposed on the interstate movement of regulated articles from both types of areas in order to prevent the movement
of pink bollworm into noninfested areas. However, eradication of pink bollworm infestations is undertaken as an
objective only in places that are designated as suppressive areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the effective date of this document, Tennessee contained no areas regulated because of pink bollworm. However,
surveys conducted by inspectors of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and by State agencies in Tennessee
have established that pink bollworm has spread into areas of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties, TN. Therefore, in order
to prevent the further spread of pink bollworm, we are amending the list of regulated areas in &sect;301.52&hyph;2a
of the regulations by designating portions of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties, TN, as pink bollworm suppressive areas.
Descriptions of those areas designated as suppressive areas are set forth in the rule portion of this document. We
are also adding Tennessee to the list in &sect;301.52(a) of States that are quarantined because of pink bollworm.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 301.52&hyph;2 of the regulations states that less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as
a regulated area only if the State is enforcing a quarantine or regulations that impose restrictions on the intrastate
movement of regulated articles that are substantially the same as those imposed with respect to the interstate movement
of such articles under the Federal regulations. Tennessee has elected to regulate the intrastate movement of regulated
articles from the designated areas of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties under the State's Plant Pest Act of 1955.

Emergency Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an emergency exists that
warrants publication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary
to prevent the artificial spread of pink bollworm to noninfested areas of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

comments.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget
has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule restricts the interstate movement of regulated articles from the regulated areas of Dyer and Lauderdale
Counties in Tennessee. Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that there are nine cotton
farms and four gin and seed disposal companies that will be affected by the new restrictions. All of these farms and
gin and seed disposal companies are considered to be small entities under Small Business Administration criteria.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 834,000 bales of cotton and 332,000 metric tons of cottonseed were produced in Tennessee in 1992; of
that total, 3,963 bales of cotton and 1,530 metric tons of cottonseed were produced in those areas of Dyer and Lauderdale
Counties affected by this interim rule. Thus, production in the affected areas of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties represents
only about 0.5 percent of the cotton and 0.5 percent of the cottonseed produced in Tennessee in 1992.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The costs of treating unprocessed cotton and cottonseed to qualify them for interstate movement is approximately
$1.90 per bale of cotton and $0.13 per bushel of cottonseed. For the 3 most recent marketing years (1990&hyph;1992),
the average price per bale of cotton received by farmers was about $284; the average price per bushel of cottonseed
received by farmers was about $1.60 (USDA, ``Agricultural Statistics 1993,'' U.S. Government Printing Office,
Washington, DC, 1993). Thus, the costs of treatment, seen as a percentage of value, range between 0.5 and 0.8 percent
of the value of cotton and between 6 and 9 percent of the value of cottonseed. The majority of the cotton and cottonseed
produced in the affected areas of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties is sold for processing, so the amount of cotton and cottonseed
produced in the affected areas that will require treatment for interstate movement is expected to be small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Plant Quarantine Act (7 U.S.C. 151 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) and the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150aa 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) authorize the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to prohibit or restrict the importation into the
United States of any plants, roots, bulbs, seeds, or other plant products in order to prevent the introduction of plant
pests into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations promulgated under this authority, among others, include 7 CFR 319.37 through 319.37&hyph;14, ``Subpart_Nursery
Stock, Plants, Roots, Bulbs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seeds, and Other Plant Products'' (the regulations). These regulations govern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the importation of living plants, plant parts, and seeds for or capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propagation, and related articles. Other sections of 7 CFR 319 deal with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
articles such as cut flowers, or fruits and vegetables intended for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations restrict or prohibit the importation of most nursery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stock, plants, roots, bulbs, seeds, and other plant products. These articles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are classified as either ``prohibited articles'' or ``restricted articles.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A prohibited article is an article that the Deputy Administrator for Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), APHIS,
has determined cannot feasibly be inspected, treated, or handled to prevent it from introducing plant pests new to
or not widely prevalent or distributed within and throughout the United States. Prohibited articles may not be imported
into the United States, unless imported by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for experimental or
scientific purposes under specified safeguards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A restricted article is an article that the Deputy Administrator for PPQ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has determined can be inspected, treated, or handled to essentially eliminate the risk of its spreading plant pests
if imported into the United States. Restricted articles may be imported into the United States if they are imported
in compliance with restrictions that may include permit and phytosanitary certificate requirements, inspection,
treatment, or postentry quarantine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the effective date of this rule, under &sect;319.37&hyph;2 of the regulations, we prohibited the importation
into the United States of strawberry plants (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fragaria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp.) from Australia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, The Netherlands,
New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, Switzerland, and the countries formed from the former Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics. Also, under the regulations, we allowed strawberry plants from countries other than
those listed above to be imported into the United States as restricted articles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule prohibits the importation into the United States of strawberry plants from any country other than Canada
or Israel. This action is intended to prevent the introduction into the United States of exotic strains of a fungal
pathogen, red stele disease, now widespread internationally. Red stele disease attacks strawberry plant roots,
reducing fruit production and in some cases killing the plant. While some strains of red stele disease already occur
in the United States, APHIS needs to prevent the introduction into the United States of exotic, and possibly more virulent,
strains of the disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, we are requiring that phytosanitary certificates of inspection accompanying 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fragaria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp. from Israel contain an additional declaration that the strawberries were found by the plant protection service
of Israel to be free of red stele disease pathogen as well as any other damaging strawberry pathogens, based on visual
inspection and indexing of the parent stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also prohibits the importation into the United States of currant plants (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ribes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp.) from New Zealand. Before the effective date of this rule, the importation of currant plants was prohibited from
Europe under &sect;319.37&hyph;2, but currant plants could be imported from other countries as restricted articles.
This action is intended to prevent the introduction into the United States of an exotic currant disease, black currant
reversion agent, which has recently spread to New Zealand. Black currant reversion agent, a viral pathogen spread
by an insect vector, can significantly reduce fruit production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this rule prohibits the importation of an additional species of the sentry palm (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp.), except as a restricted article from Lord Howe Island, New South Wales, Australia. Currently, the import of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea belmoreana
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from all countries is prohibited. However, import of the other species of the genus, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea forsterana
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, is not prohibited. Because pathogens attack most species within a genus, we believe extending the import prohibition
to both species of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are allowing importation of both species of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from Lord Howe Island as restricted articles, however, because our review of the scientific literature did not reveal
any indication of the presence of the lethal yellowing pathogen, the cadang-cadang pathogen, or any other damaging
palm pests on Lord Howe Island. Additionally, New South Wales prohibits the importation of all palms and palm products
onto the Lord Howe Island from all sources. We are requiring that phytosanitary certificates of inspection accompanying

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp. from Lord Howe Island contain both a declaration of origin (must be Lord Howe Island) and a declaration that the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 were found by the plant protection service of New South Wales to be free of the lethal yellowing pathogen and the cadang-cadang
pathogen, as well as any other damaging palm pathogens, based on visual inspection.

Miscellaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are also changing in &sect;319.37&hyph;2 the spelling of the genus name of the sentry palm from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howeia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the more common spelling.

Immediate Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary to prevent the introduction
into the United States of exotic diseases affecting strawberries, currants, and sentry palms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the
comments.

This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule prohibits the import of strawberry plants from all foreign countries except Canada and Israel and
prohibits the import of currant plants from New Zealand. Also, it prohibits the import into the United States of an
additional species of the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (sentry palm), except from Lord Howe Island, New South Wales.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, strawberry plants are imported into the United States only from Canada and Israel and only by one importer.
Furthermore, this importer is not a small entity by Small Business Administration standards (having 100 or fewer
employees). Therefore, prohibiting the import of strawberry plants from all foreign countries except Canada and
Israel would not have a significant economic impact on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No currant plants are now imported into the United States from New Zealand. Prohibiting their import from New Zealand
thus will not have a significant economic impact on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we were not able to obtain any information on the domestic production or import of either species of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
; we believe this is because 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is neither produced domestically nor imported on a large scale. We anticipate, therefore, that prohibiting the import
into the United States of both species of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Howea
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from everywhere except Lord Howe Island, New South Wales, Australia, will not have a significant economic impact
on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule clarifies that peanut handlers not signatory to Peanut Marketing Agreement No. 146 (Agreement)
may store and shell certain Segregation 2 seed peanut lots with Segregation 1 seed peanut lots when such lots are produced
under the auspices of a State agency which regulates or controls their production. This interim rule also updates
information on the laboratories qualified to perform aflatoxin testing of shelled peanuts. Allowing peanut handlers
to commingle certain seed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peanut lots reduces the space and costs needed to store seed peanuts. Updating laboratory information should assist
handlers in moving peanuts to market. These changes are intended to bring the non-signatory handling requirements
into conformity with those specified in the Agreement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule is issued pursuant to requirements of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This interim final rule will not preempt
any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is
to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be
unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 45 handlers of peanuts who have not signed the Agreement who are subject to the regulations
contained herein. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601]
as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. It is estimated that most of the handlers are small entities.
Most producers doing business with these handlers are also small entities. Small agricultural producers have been
defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the reported U.S. production, mostly covered under the Agreement, was approximately 3.33 billion pounds
of peanuts, a 22 percent decrease from 1992 and the lowest level since 1983. The preliminary 1993 peanut crop value
is $991.65 million, 77 percent of the 1992 crop value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After aflatoxin was found in peanuts in the mid-1960's, the domestic peanut industry has sought to minimize aflatoxin
contamination in peanuts and peanut products. Under authority of the Act, Peanut Marketing Agreement No. 146 and
the Peanut Administrative Committee (Committee) were established by the Secretary in 1965. The Agreement was signed
by a majority of domestic peanut handlers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 101&hyph;220, enacted December 12, 1989, amended section 608(b) of the Act to require that all peanuts
handled by persons who have not entered into the Agreement (non-signers) be subject to quality and inspection requirements
to the same extent and manner as are required under the Agreement. It is estimated that 5 percent of the domestic peanut
crop is marketed by non-signatory handlers and the remainder of the crop is handled by signatory handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the non-signer provisions, no peanuts may be sold or otherwise disposed of for human consumption if the peanuts
fail to meet the quality requirements of the Agreement. Regulations to implement Pub. L. 101&hyph;220 were issued
and made effective on December 4, 1990 [55 FR 49980] and amended several times thereafter, and are published in 7 CFR
Part 997. All such amendments were made to ensure that the non-signer handling requirements remain consistent with
modifications to the handling requirements applied to signatory handlers under the Agreement. Violation of those
regulations may result in a penalty in the form of an assessment by the Secretary equal to 140 percent of the support
price for quota peanuts. The support price for quota peanuts is determined under section 108B of the Agricultural
Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1445c&hyph;3) for the crop year during which the violation occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of P.L. 101&hyph;220 and the objective of the Agreement is to insure that only wholesome peanuts of good
quality enter edible market channels. Under the non-signer and Agreement regulatory provisions, farmers' stock
peanuts with visible 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aspergillus flavus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mold (the principal source of aflatoxin) are required to be diverted to non-edible uses. Each lot of shelled peanuts
and certain lots of inshell peanuts, destined for edible channels, must be officially sampled and chemically tested
for aflatoxin by the Department or in other laboratories listed in the regulations. Inspection and chemical analysis
programs are administered by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the non-signer provisions, the second sentence of paragraph (e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Seed peanuts
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 prohibits the commingling of Segregation 2 seed lots with Segregation 1 peanut lots intended for human consumption.
The difference between Segregation 1 and Segregation 2 lots is that Segregation 1 lots may contain no more than 2 percent
damaged kernels and no more than 1 percent concealed damaged kernels, while Segregation 2 lots may contain more than
2 percent damaged kernels and 1 percent concealed damaged kernels. Both Segregation 1 lots and Segregation 2 lots
must be free of visible 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aspergillus flavus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule clarifies the handling provisions in paragraph (e) of &sect;997.20 Incoming regulation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to allow Segregation 2 seed peanut lots containing up to 3 percent total damaged kernels to be stored, shelled and commingled
with Segregation 1 seed peanut lots if both lots were produced under the auspices of a State peanut agency which regulates
or controls the production of the lots being commingled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee meets in February or March each year and recommends to the Secretary such rules and regulations as may
be necessary to keep the Agreement consistent with current industry practice. The Committee met on March 16, 1994,
and unanimously recommended clarification of seed peanut handling regulations under the Agreement. Members of
the Committee noted the impracticality of having separate storage bins for each of the various types and varieties
of seed peanuts with up to 3 percent damage. It was noted that, if Segregation 2 seed lots with up to 3 percent damaged
must be stored separate from Segregation 1 seed lots, ``foundation,'' ``registered,'' and ``certified'' seed lots
would have to be segregated into separate categories. This could increase the number of separate bins and space needed
to store seed peanut lots. The current regulations for both signers and non-signers do not specifically address commingling
Segregation 1 seed lots with Segregation 2 seed lots. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee concluded that it is impracticable to require such Segregation 2 seed peanuts be stored and shelled
separate from Segregation 1 seed peanuts. The Department has initiated rulemaking to implement such a clarification
in handling requirements applied on signatory handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule revises &sect;997.20(e) for non-signer seed peanuts and is intended to bring the non-signatory
handling requirements into conformity with those specified in the Agreement. This rule clarifies handling requirements
and will facilitate the movement of peanuts to market.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule will have no affect on the outgoing quality regulation of the non-signer provisions. The quality and handling
requirements, as specified in &sect;997.30 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Outgoing regulations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 applicable to non-signatory 1993&hyph;94 crop peanuts, continues to be effective for 1994&hyph;95 crop peanuts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule also updates addresses and facsimile numbers, where applicable, of approved aflatoxin testing
laboratories that perform chemical analyses required by the non-signatory handling regulations. This information
is provided in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of &sect;997.30 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Outgoing regulations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Non-signatory handlers may send peanut samples to any laboratory on the list, per instructions specified in paragraph
(c) of the outgoing regulation. This rule also updates information in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) identifying the contact
point of the USDA Science Division headquarter's office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this interim final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all available information, it is found that this action will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impractical, unnecessary and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) This action merely clarifies restrictions on peanut handlers not subject to the Agreement; (2) the new
crop year begins on July 1, 1994, and handlers need to know the regulations applicable to handling the 1994 and subsequent
crop year peanuts as soon as possible; (3) this action brings the quality requirements under Part 997 into conformity
with those under the Agreement, as required by the Act; and (4) this action provides a 30-day comment period, and any
comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan [7 CFR 1210], hereinafter referred as the
Plan. The Plan is effective under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act, as amended by the Watermelon Research
and Promotion Improvement Act of 1993, [7 U.S.C. 4901&hyph;4916] hereinafter referred as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been determined to be not-significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not
been reviewed by OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under &sect;1650
of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision
of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification
of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition.
After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the
United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date
of the entry of the ruling.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 750 watermelon handlers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5,000 watermelon producers in the 50 States of the United States who would be affected by this rule. There are approximately
140 importers of watermelons. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5 million and small agricultural producers are defined
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of watermelon handlers, producers, and importers
may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. production of watermelons is estimated through the use of U.S. shipment statistics. Shipments of U.S.-produced
watermelons totaled about 1,895.6 million pounds in 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 percent less than in 1992. Imports of watermelons in 1993 totalled 343.5 million pounds, an increase of 12 percent.
Therefore, domestic production is about six times as great as the volume of imports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to the procedures for conduct of referenda reflect amendments to the Act. The overall economic impact
of these changes is not expected to be significant. The change from voting at Extension Service county offices to voting
by mail ballot will not cause a change in the burden on voters. Allowing importers to vote in the referendum would add
a burden for those importers who choose to vote. However, this burden is offset by the opportunity to vote on whether
they are covered by the program. Increasing the exemption level from 5 acres to 10 acres and the change in producers'
eligibility to vote will reduce the number of small producers eligible to vote in the program and hence the reduce burden
on small producers. Further, voting in the referendum is voluntary. Including the 50 States and the District of Columbia
will cause a burden on those producers and handlers in those regions but this burden is offset by the opportunity to
participate in the referendum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The research and promotion program is expected to continue to benefit producers, handlers, and importers subject
to the Plan by expanding and maintaining new and existing markets. Accordingly, the Administrator of AMS has determined
that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Paperwork Reduction Act

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[40 U.S.C. chapter 35], the information collection requirements contained in the Plan have previously been approved
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0093. There will be a new reporting
burden on importers but the burden has been already approved by the OMB and assigned OMB control number 0581&hyph;0093.
This action adds no additional reporting burden. It has been estimated that it will take an average of 10 minutes for
each producer, handler, and importer of watermelons to participate in the voluntary referendum balloting.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the Plan, the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) administers a nationally coordinated program of
research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen the watermelon's position in the market
place and to establish, maintain, and expand markets for domestic watermelons. This program is financed by assessments
on producers and handlers of watermelons. The Plan specifies that handlers are responsible for collecting and submitting
both the producer and handler assessments to the Board, reporting their handling of watermelons, and maintaining
records necessary to verify their reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposed rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 14, 1994 [59 FR 17739]. The rule published in April contained the proposed amendments to the Plan, rules and
regulations, rules of practice for petitions, and referendum procedures. The Department has decided to separately
make final the referendum procedures because the changes to the referendum procedures must be in place in order to
conduct the referendum in November 1994 on two of the amendments. Therefore, this action will put into effect the subpart
containing the referendum procedures. The proposed amendments to the Plan, rules and regulations, and rules of practice
for petitions are published separately in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deadline for comments on all of the proposed amendments published on April 14 was May 16, 1994. Twenty-one comments
were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three of the comments related to the referendum procedures. Three commentors stated that proof of voter eligibility
should be required. They stated that this could be accomplished by requesting voters to provide their business identification
number or social security number and/or sales receipts, acreage reports, or bill of lading that reflect their watermelon
activity for 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with requesting business identification number or social security number on the ballot as
proof of voter eligibility. However, it is not necessary to modify the referendum rules in order to collect this information.
This collection of information has been approved by OMB under OMB number 0581&hyph;0093 and does not add any burden
on voters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the Act authorize an assessment on watermelons imported into the United States by importers and
the addition of importer members to the Board if approved by watermelon producers, handlers, and importers in a referendum.
Therefore, watermelon importers will also be eligible to vote in the referenda. In order to include importers in the
referendum procedures, this rule will amend &sect;&sect;1210.200, 1210.201, 1210.202, 1210.203, and 1210.204
of the referendum procedures.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act increased the acreage for exempt producers from ``less than 5 acres'' to ``less than 10 acres'' of watermelons
and changed the eligibility for producers to serve on the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that a producer is eligible to serve on the Board as a representative of handlers (1) if a producer purchases
watermelons from other producers in a combined total volume that is equal to 25 percent or more of the producer's own
production or (2) if the combined total volume of watermelons handled by the producer from the producer's own production
and purchases from other producer's production is more than 50 percent of the producer's own production. This provision
clarifies the eligibility of producers and handlers to serve on the Board as representatives of their specific group
and also applies to voter eligibility. In addition, the increase in the exemption level from ``less than 5 acres''
to ``less than 10 acres'' will determine producer's eligibility to vote because only producers of 10 acres or more
will be eligible to vote in the referendum. Therefore, this rule will amend &sect;&sect;1210.201 and 1210.202. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also increases applicability of the law from the 48 contiguous States to the 50 States and the District of Columbia.
Therefore, since they will be covered by the Plan, voters in Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia are entitled
to vote in the referendum. This rule will amend &sect;1210.201 accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also provides that all future promulgation and amendment referenda do not have to be conducted at Extension
Service county offices. This procedure proved to be expensive and difficult to administer. The Act will now allow
referenda to be conducted by mail ballot which will reduce the costs involved in conducting referenda and facilitate
a more timely tabulation of the results. In order to make this change, this rule will amend &sect;&sect;1210.203 and
1210.204. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minor changes are made in this final rule for the purpose of clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, conforming changes will be made to &sect;1210.201. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented with regard to the procedures to conduct a referendum, it
is found that they effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the provisions in 5 U.S.C. 553, it is found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the
effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It is necessary to have these procedures in place in order to conduct the referendum in November 1994; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No useful purpose will be served by a delay of the effective date.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is amending its regulations governing mergers and combinations involving
Federal savings associations to implement sections 501 and 502 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act of 1991 (FDICIA). In general, the FDICIA amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) and to the Home
Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) ease previous restrictions on conversion transactions, and authorize Federally-chartered
savings associations to acquire and be acquired by other depository institutions insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC), subject to specified conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS is amending and further broadening its regulations to authorize combinations involving Federal stock savings
associations and depository institutions that are not insured by the FDIC. The OTS also is amending its regulations
to authorize Federal mutual savings associations to combine with other types of depository institutions provided
that the transaction results in a mutual savings association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the OTS is amending its regulations governing mergers and application procedures to: specify the types
of transactions that require only an information filing with the OTS; specify the types of transactions that require
OTS approval of a notice or application, and the related time frames, and further clarify and consolidate OTS regulations
by incorporating the OTS's merger and transfer of assets policy statement into a single regulation.

I. Background and Summary of Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 18, 1992, the OTS issued notice of a proposal to amend the agency's regulations governing mergers and other
combinations to permit mergers, consolidations and transfer of asset and assumption of liability transactions
among savings associations and other FDIC-insured depository institutions in accordance with sections 501 and
502 of the FDICIA.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the OTS proposed changes to its regulations to allow Federal savings associations to convert directly
to state and national banks (while retaining Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) deposit insurance) in a so-called
``Sasser conversion,''
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and to permit any FDIC-insured depository institution that qualifies for Federal Home Loan Bank membership to convert
to a Federal savings association charter. The proposal also specified the types of transactions that would require
either prior notice or application to the OTS, and the time frames governing review of these filings. The proposal
did not include amendments to the merger regulations involving mutual savings associations. However, specific
comments were requested as to whether mutual savings associations should be permitted to merge directly with banks
without first undergoing a mutual-to stock conversion and what safeguards would be necessary for such transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the OTS proposed to streamline and consolidate its regulations by, among other things, eliminating unnecessary
portions of the OTS's merger and transfer of assets policy statement and incorporating the remainder in a better organized
fashion into the revised section 563.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS solicited public comments on all aspects of the proposal for a 30-day period. Upon consideration of all the
comments received during the comment period, the OTS is adopting the proposal with some modifications, discussed
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS received 10 comment letters in response to the proposal, including four from savings banks, two from savings
and loan holding companies, two from trade associations representing financial institutions, one from a law firm
representing financial institutions and one from the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB). The OTS has carefully
considered all of the comments received during the comment period. In addition, the OTS has reviewed the rulemakings
of other Federal banking agencies on related subjects, and has sought, to the maximum extent possible, to adopt consistent
provisions. The following is a discussion of the issues raised by the commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Mandatory Federal Home Loan Bank Membership for Converting Savings Associations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the proposal, section 5(f) of the HOLA requires Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLBank) membership for all Federal
savings associations, and FHLBank membership was consistently required of state-chartered savings associations
by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation as a condition of deposit insurance. In addition, after enactment
of the FIRREA, the OTS required resulting banks in thrift-to-bank charter conversions and Oakar transactions
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 in which no savings association survived the transaction to continue to hold the former savings association's FHLBank
stock in accordance with the requirements of the FHFB. Each commenter that addressed this issue objected to any regulation
that would continue this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As used herein, an ``Oakar'' transaction refers to a combination between a savings association and a bank that is excepted
from the moratorium on deposit insurance fund conversion set forth at section 5(d)(2)(A)(ii) of the FDIA by virtue
of section 5(d)(3) of the FDIA. See 12 U.S.C. 1815(d)(2)(A)(ii) and 1815(d)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since publication of the proposal, the FHFB advised the OTS that it will not require a savings association that has
converted to a bank charter to retain membership in the FHLBank system, nor will the FHFB require a non-FHLBank system
member that has acquired some or all of the assets of a savings association to become a member of the FHLBank system.
In light of the FHFB's views on this issue, the OTS advised the FHFB on November 20, 1992 that the OTS was discontinuing
its practice of imposing the condition that such institutions retain FHLBank stock. In addition, the OTS advised
the FHFB that in prior cases where the FHLBank stock condition was imposed, the OTS would not object if a bank seeks to
redeem its FHLBank stock and terminate its FHLBank membership. In March 1993, the OTS reiterated these positions
in promulgating a final regulation that will remove, in 1995, the regulatory requirement that state-chartered savings
associations have and maintain FHLBank membership.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the final rule does not require FHLBank membership of resulting institutions in the context of thrift-to-bank
mergers and charter conversions.

B. Issues Regarding Mutual Savings Associations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current OTS regulations generally provide that merger transactions involving Federal mutual savings associations
must result in a mutual form of savings association, unless the mutual institution converts to a stock savings association
as part of the transaction.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal did not set forth any amendments to these regulations, but did solicit comment as to whether mutual savings
associations should be permitted to merge with banks or other institutions other than in conjunction with a mutual-to-stock
conversion, and if permitted, what safeguards should be established with respect to these transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments addressing this issue unanimously opposed any regulation that would permit Federal mutual savings
associations to be acquired by commercial banks or other stock-form institutions without a prior or simultaneous
mutual-to-stock conversion by the mutual savings association. These commenters expressed the view that OTS regulations
adequately protect the interests of mutual accountholders
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 and direct acquisition resulting in a stock institution may jeopardize those protections. They also noted that the
FDICIA does not evidence any intent to change the current treatment of combinations involving mutual associations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS has recently issued an interim final regulation, with a request for comment, revising certain key provisions
in its mutual to stock conversion regulations. The amendments generally prohibit merger conversions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, where a mutual savings association converts to stock form and simultaneously merges into another stock form depository
institution) except in certain supervisory situations. In addition, OTS has proposed to add a ``convenience and
needs'' test to its standards for approving mutual to stock conversions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS agrees with these comments and, accordingly, the final regulations continue to prohibit Federal mutual associations
from combining with stock form institutions where the resulting institution is not a mutual savings association,
except in the context of a mutual to stock conversion, and subject to other limited exceptions. Nevertheless, as more
fully described below, the OTS has determined that Federal mutual savings associations may, in general, combine
with stock form institutions where the Federal mutual association is the resulting association. The final rule includes
revisions to 12 CFR 546.2 and 546.3 to effect these changes.

C. Review Period Under Section 10(s)(2) of the HOLA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal solicited comment on processing procedures and time frames, including whether applications subject
to section 10(s)(2) of the HOLA should be deemed ``filed'' when deemed complete under the OTS's general application
processing procedures in 12 CFR Part 516. Under the proposal, the 60-day review time for these applications would
not commence until an application is reviewed by the OTS and deemed complete under part 516. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters objected to the OTS's interpretation of the term ``filed'' in section 10(s) of the HOLA. These commenters
suggested that the review time frames for applications under section 10(s)(2) should commence when an application
is first submitted to the OTS, not when it is deemed complete. One commenter supported the proposal, noting that any
regulation providing different ``filed'' dates for applications under part 516 and section 10(s) of the HOLA would
serve no purpose and would create confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in more detail in Section III.D. below, the final rule adopts the proposed application review time frames.
To ensure uniform treatment of all transactional applications, the OTS believes applications subject to section
10(s)(2) of the HOLA should be processed, to the extent possible, consistently with all applications under part 516.
Also, the processing time frames in the rule are consistent with the procedures established by the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency for conversion applications by national banks under section 502(b) of the FDICIA.

This commenter asserted that although section 5(d)(3) of the FDIA requires the OTS to consider the factors set forth
in section 18(c) of the FDIA (the Bank Merger Act (BMA)) in acting upon an Oakar transaction, the BMA is not itself applicable
to such transactions. Therefore, according to the commenter, an application to engage in an Oakar transaction is
not an ``application for a deposit facility'' within the meaning of the CRA, and the CRA requirement that the OTS take
an institution's CRA record into account in its evaluation of an application for a deposit facility

We find the commenter's assertions to be unpersuasive. Section 5(d)(3) of the FDIA merely establishes an exception
to the general moratorium on insurance fund ``conversion transactions'' set forth at section 5(d)(2)(A)(ii) of
the FDIA. Section 5(d)(3) does not state that Oakar transactions are excepted from all otherwise applicable approval
requirements, and the BMA itself includes no exception from its plain language with respect to Oakar transactions.
Moreover, the authorization provided by section 10(s) of the HOLA is subject to section 5(d)(3) of the FDIA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and the BMA, and all other applicable laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS, after further consideration of its applications processing procedures, observes that the procedures in
part 516 of the OTS's regulations are intended to ensure that an application will not be deemed complete until expiration
of the public comment period and resolution of any protests or other significant issues raised during that period.
Accordingly, any challenges to a transaction on CRA grounds would be resolved prior to the commencement of the processing
time frames under section 10(s)(2) of the HOLA. The OTS has amended the publication procedures for applications under
&sect;563.22(a) to ensure that the public comment period has concluded before the OTS is required to make a completeness
determination regarding such applications.

E. Application Review Standards and Regulatory Streamlining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The OTS proposed to incorporate into revised &sect;563.22 the approval standards, definitional provisions and
other provisions of the OTS's merger and transfer of assets policy statement found at 12 CFR 571.5. The proposal requested
comment on whether any of the standards in &sect;571.5 should be streamlined, clarified or otherwise modified or
deleted in connection with their incorporation into &sect;563.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that some of the review criteria in &sect;571.5 went beyond the standards applicable to transactions
under sections 5(d)(3) of the FDIA and 10(s) of the HOLA, and therefore should not be considered by the OTS in reviewing
applications under these statutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 571.5 set forth not only the review standards for transactions under sections 5(d)(3) and 18(c) of the FDIA
and 10(s) of the HOLA, but also general safety and soundness considerations applicable to all transfer transactions
and combinations involving savings associations. Thus, the OTS believes it is appropriate to retain these review
criteria. However, certain of the detailed criteria addressed in &sect;571.5, for example those pertaining to retention
of attorneys and other professionals, tie-in transactions, and fees paid in connection with transactions, are considered
by OTS as part of the overall evaluation of the managerial and financial resources and future prospects of the savings
associations involved in a combination or transfer transaction. The OTS believes that the detail of certain criteria
is not necessary and that general standards are more appropriate for an evaluation of the safety and soundness of a
given transaction. Accordingly, &sect;563.22(d) of the final rule has been revised to incorporate streamlined
and consolidated review standards derived from &sect;571.5, and &sect;571.5 has been deleted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
One commenter requested that the OTS clarify whether section 10(s)(3) of the HOLA (and &sect;552.13(b)(1) as set
forth in the proposal) precludes transfer or consolidation transactions where a resulting institution would own
the shares of one or more constituent institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In OTS's view, section 10(s)(3) of the HOLA does not prohibit a Federal savings association from acquiring the stock
of another insured depository institution and holding the other depository institution as a subsidiary. Section
10(s) was designed to cure what had been viewed as a statutory impediment to mergers or other combinations between
a savings association and other types of insured depository institutions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 10(s) was not established to bar transactions that are permissible under other, existing authority. Moreover,
neither the text of section 502 of FDICIA nor its legislative history indicate that Congress intended section 10(s)(3)
to override any separate legal authority for such an acquisition.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary impediment was section 5(d)(3) of the HOLA, which, in pertinent part, authorizes the OTS to provide for
the merger of savings associations with other savings associations, but is silent as to whether savings associations
could merge with other types of depository institutions. For many years, the OTS, and its predecessor, the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, viewed the lack of express authorization for cross-industry mergers as, in effect, a prohibition
on such transactions.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal savings associations, therefore, may acquire the shares of another insured depository institution and
hold the acquired entity as a subsidiary if the legal authority for the transaction derives from a source other than
section 10(s) of the HOLA. Such legal authority may be found, for example, under the service corporation provisions
of the HOLA, and the OTS service corporation and operating subsidiary regulations.

Accordingly, the final regulations provide that a Federal savings association may ``combine'' with any depository
institution (subject to compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and certain other provisions), and
define the term ``combination'' as a ``merger or consolidation with another depository institution, or an acquisition
of all or substantially all of the assets or assumption of all or substantially all of the liabilities of a depository
institution by another depository institution.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned the OTS's authority to require any filing from a savings association proposing to convert
to a bank charter or merge or transfer all of its assets to a bank. This commenter also questioned the necessity of any
filing with the OTS in view of the requirement under the BMA that the OTS be provided with a copy of the application filed
with the regulatory agency of the resulting depository institution. The filing requirements in the regulations
as adopted enable the OTS, consistent with its broad responsibilities under the HOLA and other statutes, to ensure
safe and sound operation of savings associations, identify any pending or potential supervisory concerns or enforcement
actions involving the savings associations that are parties to the transaction, and, at a minimum, advise the appropriate
regulatory agency regarding these concerns. The procedures are not contrary to any of the provisions of section 5(d)
of the FDIA, and, in fact, represent a significant simplification of long-standing OTS application and approval
requirements, which have been upheld by the courts.

One commenter suggested that the OTS shorten the review period for applications submitted by savings associations,
where the association previously had sought expedited treatment, but the OTS had advised the association that it
was not eligible for expedited treatment. Under the final rule, such applications will be processed under standard
time frames regardless of prior filings. However, to the extent a previously filed notice provides the OTS with useful
information regarding a proposed transaction, it is likely that the OTS will be able to act on a subsequent, properly
filed application prior to expiration of the full 60-day review period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter inquired how the OTS would treat applications filed under &sect;563.22 that are awaiting OTS
action at the effective date of the amended regulation, and whether such applications would need to be re-filed in
accordance with the procedures adopted in the final rule. The commenter also inquired about the treatment that would
be accorded applications that were approved but not consummated prior to adoption of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both pending applications and proposed transactions that are now solely within the scope of new &sect;563.22(b)(1)
will be subject to the new procedures upon the effective date of the amendments. Other applications currently awaiting
OTS action will continue to be subject to the standards and procedures in effect at the time the applications were filed.
Previously approved transactions must be consummated in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the
OTS's approval order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As more fully discussed below, the final regulations implement section 502 of the FDICIA by authorizing Federal stock
associations to combine with any FDIC-insured depository institution, and by authorizing Federal mutual associations
to combine with any FDIC-insured depository institution, provided that a mutual association is the resulting institution.
In addition, the final regulations authorize certain combinations involving Federal associations and depository
institutions not insured by the FDIC. The final regulations specifically authorize Federal stock savings associations
to convert to state or national banks, and permit any stock-form depository institution that is, or is eligible to
become, a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank, to convert to a Federal stock savings association charter. Finally, the
OTS is amending its regulations governing the procedures regarding applications to engage in the above-described
actions, and has made various technical and conforming amendments.

A. Expansion of Permissible Combinations for Federal Stock Savings Associations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule revises 12 CFR 552.13(c) to permit Federal stock savings associations to combine with any depository
institution, upon compliance with appropriate application or notice requirements, described in Section III.D.
below. The rule also establishes standards for combinations, including standards that address compliance with
the asset composition requirements of section 5(c) of the HOLA and the qualified thrift lender requirements of section
10(m) of the HOLA, when a thrift acquires a bank. In addition, the regulation modifies and adds definitions for terms
used throughout amended sections 552.13 and 563.22 to implement the new provisions of the HOLA and the FDIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulation differs from the proposal in certain respects. The term ``acquire'' has been changed to ``combination,''
and expanded to include combinations involving depository institutions not insured by the FDIC. Also, the term ``combination''
has been clarified to include purchase and assumption transactions that involve all or substantially all of a depository
institution's assets or liabilities, rather than transactions of a lesser scope, such as branch sale transactions.
The definition of the term ``combination'' reflects the OTS's position that the definition of the term ``acquire''
at section 10(s)(3) does not preclude a Federal savings association from holding another insured depository institution
as a subsidiary, pursuant to a separate source of authority to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10(s)(1) of the HOLA states that Federal savings associations may acquire or be acquired by any insured depository
institution, subject to sections 5(d)(3) and 18(c) of the FDIA, and all other applicable laws. The OTS has concluded
that the reference to section 5(d)(3) of the FDIA does not mean that section 5(d)(3) must be applicable in order for
a combination transaction to be permissible. The grant of authority in section 10(s)(1) of the HOLA to Federal savings
associations to acquire or be acquired by another insured depository institution simply requires that any Federal
savings association that proposes such a transaction comply with all applicable laws. Section 10(s)(1) was not intended
to withhold from Federal associations the authority to engage in transactions exempted from the FIRREA moratorium
on conversion transactions under other provisions of the FDIA,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 or in transactions that are not subject to the moratorium in the first place (for example, because the transaction
involves two SAIF-insured savings associations, or occurs after expiration of the moratorium). The OTS has clarified
the final regulation accordingly.

The final regulation expands the categories of depository institutions with which Federal stock associations have
the power to merge from only FDIC-insured depository institutions to any depository institution. Federal stock
associations have been authorized to acquire or be acquired by non-FDIC insured depository institutions in purchase
and assumption transactions since 1985.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 The OTS has concluded that continuing to require such transactions to be accomplished through purchase and assumption
transactions, rather than through merger transactions elevates form over substance, and may impose unnecessary
expenses and complications on Federal stock associations that propose to engage in transactions with uninsured
depository institutions.

Where a Federal stock association proposes to merge with an uninsured depository institution, and the Federal stock
association would survive the transaction, the Federal stock association would be required to seek approval from
the FDIC under section 18(c)(1) of the FDIA, as well as from the OTS under the transfer of assets regulations at 12 CFR
563.22(c). If the Federal stock association is not the resulting institution, the association must obtain OTS approval
under 12 CFR 563.22(c), and provide any required notices to depositors, and to the FDIC.

The OTS notes, however, that the concerns regarding the protection of mutual accountholders' interests in the acquisitions
of Federal mutual associations do not arise when the Federal mutual association is the acquiring/surviving entity.
Accordingly, the OTS is amending 12 CFR 546.2, governing mergers involving Federal mutual associations, to permit
Federal mutual associations to merge with FDIC-insured depository institutions, as well as non-FDIC insured depository
institutions, where a mutual savings association is the resulting entity. This treatment parallels the treatment
of Federal stock associations. These combinations also would be subject to the same statutory and regulatory approval
standards as apply to stock form associations engaging in a comparable transaction, described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 546.2 has not previously addressed the ability of Federal mutual associations to combine with other institutions
in purchase and assumption transactions. The OTS has amended &sect;546.2 to provide specific authority for Federal
mutual associations to combine with other entities in purchase and assumption transactions, subject to the same
limitations that apply in the case of merger transactions involving Federal mutual associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The OTS regulations for Federal mutual savings associations have not been amended to authorize specifically the
conversion of Federal mutual savings associations to state mutual savings banks, because such conversions are specifically
authorized under section 5(i)(3) of the HOLA. Federal mutual savings associations proposing to convert to state
mutual savings banks are required to notify the OTS or obtain OTS approval as described in section III.D., below.

The OTS is amending 12 CFR 552.2&hyph;6 to permit, with prior OTS approval, any stock-form depository institution
that is, or is eligible to become, a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank, to convert to a Federal stock savings association
charter. The depository institution, at the time of the conversion, must have deposits insured by the FDIC. In addition,
the depository institution, in accomplishing the conversion, must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations,
including, without limitation, the insurance fund conversion moratorium provisions set forth at section 5(d) of
the FDIA.

The OTS has broad legal authority with respect to Federal savings associations under section 5(a) of the HOLA, which
authorizes the Director of the OTS, under such regulations as the Director may prescribe, to,

, provide for the organization, incorporation, examination, operation, and regulation of Federal savings associations.
Section 5(a) of the HOLA provides the OTS with plenary authority over Federal savings associations, and, as the Supreme
Court has noted, it would be difficult for Congress to give a broader mandate.

The OTS notes that section 5(i)(1) of the HOLA provides specific authorization for ``[a]ny savings association which
is, or is eligible to become, a member of a Federal home loan bank'' to ``convert into a Federal savings association,''
subject to such regulations as the Director may prescribe. Immediately prior to the enactment of FIRREA, section
5(i)(1) of the HOLA permitted any ``institution'' which is, or is eligible to become, a member of a Federal home loan
bank to convert to a Federal savings and loan association or Federal savings bank, subject to the regulations of the
FHLBB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FIRREA revised the language of section 5(i)(1) of the HOLA from any ``institution'' which is, or is eligible to become,
a member of a Federal home loan bank, to any ``savings association'' that met such criteria. However, the OTS's review
of the legislative history of FIRREA has revealed no intent on the part of Congress in the FIRREA to limit the types of
depository institutions that may convert to a Federal savings association charter. Instead, it appears that the
change in the ``institution'' terminology in section 5(i)(1) of the HOLA was inadvertent, and occurred when the term
``insured institution,'' occurring throughout the HOLA, was changed in FIRREA to ``savings association.'' Accordingly,
the use of the OTS's authority under section 5(a) of the HOLA to broaden the class of depository institutions that are
eligible for a Federal charter is not inconsistent with the FIRREA amendments to section 5(i)(1) of the HOLA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New section 552.2&hyph;6 enables commercial banks and other depository institutions to accomplish directly what
they have previously been able to accomplish indirectly. For example, in many cases, a state bank or other depository
institution may, under state law, convert to a state-chartered savings bank, or a state-chartered savings association,
which may, consistent with state law and section 5(i) of the HOLA (or, in some cases, section 5(o) of the HOLA), convert
to a Federal savings association or a Federal savings bank. Similarly, a commercial bank or other depository institution
may cause the chartering of a Federal association, and then transfer its assets and liabilities to the savings association.

The OTS believes that federal statutes should be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with their purpose.
In so doing, the substance, not merely the form of a transaction, is key. It is clear that no federal statutory barrier
exists to the ultimate accomplishment of conversions of depository institutions to Federal thrift charters, provided
that all applicable chartering and insurance requirements are met. Thus, absent compelling reasons to the contrary,
to read the HOLA as implicitly requiring a multi-step process to accomplish these types of charter conversions would
impose unnecessary expenses and complications upon depository institutions that wish to operate as Federal savings
associations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The classes of depository institutions that are permitted to convert to a Federal stock association charter under
&sect;552.2&hyph;6 is broader than set forth in the proposed version of the regulation, which addressed only conversions
by FDIC-insured depository institutions. The OTS believes that there are no compelling legal or policy reasons why
stock-form depository institutions not insured by the FDIC should not be permitted to convert directly to a Federal
savings association.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 However, these institutions must meet the requirements for Federal Home Loan Bank membership, receive FDIC insurance
of accounts prior to consummation of the conversion, and otherwise comply with all applicable statutes and regulations.

The OTS is not, at this time, adopting a corresponding regulation that would authorize mutual-form depository institutions
to convert to Federal mutual savings associations. The OTS may, in the future, consider promulgating a regulation
authorizing such conversions. The OTS notes, however, that mutual-form state chartered savings banks that are insured
by the Bank Insurance Fund are authorized to convert to Federal mutual savings banks, pursuant to section 5(o) of the
HOLA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, the FDIA requires prior OTS approval of combinations between savings associations and other types of FDIC-insured
depository institutions where the acquiring, assuming, or resulting institution is a savings association. In such
transactions, the OTS will continue to require an application under amended &sect;563.22(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under previous regulations, any savings association that proposed to convert to a bank in a Sasser transaction or
be acquired by a bank in an Oakar transaction was required to file a transfer of assets application with the OTS.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 The OTS continues to believe that an application process requiring prior written approval is necessary in certain
situations, discussed below. However, with respect to Oakar transactions and other combinations between a thrift
and a bank in which no savings association survives, the OTS's experience has indicated that a notification requirement
would be sufficient. The OTS will advise the appropriate Federal banking agency of any supervisory concerns, enforcement
actions and other relevant information regarding the institution.

Any savings association that proposes to convert to a bank charter in a Sasser conversion must file a notification
or application with the OTS, depending on whether the savings association meets the requirements for expedited treatment
under &sect;516.3(a). Specifically, savings associations that qualify for expedited treatment under &sect;516.3(a)(1)
will be eligible to use the notification procedure set forth at &sect;563.22(h)(1) in order to engage in a Sasser conversion.
Savings associations that do not qualify for such treatment will be required to file an application in order to engage
in a Sasser conversion. Such applications will be subject to the general application processing timeframes.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 The OTS notes that this procedure represents a significant reduction in burden from the prior procedures, under which
every savings association that proposed to undertake a Sasser conversion was required to file a detailed application.

The proposal included a notification requirement for all savings associations undertaking a Sasser transaction.
Based on additional experience, the OTS is requiring an application from savings associations that fail to qualify
for expedited processing and propose to undertake a Sasser transaction, because such associations may, in certain
cases, present compliance or safety and soundness concerns that may warrant denial or conditioning of the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating applications proposing Sasser conversions, the OTS will assess the applicable factors set forth in
&sect;563.22(d)(1), and whether the conversion may have a negative effect on the safety and soundness of the association
or present a risk to the appropriate deposit insurance fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 563.22(b) and (c) have been amended and a new &sect;563.22(h) has been added to the regulations setting forth
special requirements and procedures for transactions subject to &sect;&sect;563.22 (b) and (c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, amended &sect;563.22(b)(1) of the final rule requires prior notification to the OTS in accordance
with new &sect;563.22(h)(1) of Sasser conversions of savings associations that meet the criteria for expedited
treatment under &sect;516.3(a), and combinations between savings associations and FDIC-insured depository institutions
(such as Oakar transactions) where no savings association will survive consummation of the transaction. The notification
must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the conversion or combination, but not later than the
date on which an application relating to the proposed transaction is filed with the primary regulator of the resulting
association. The rule also provides that, upon request or on its own initiative, the OTS may shorten the 30-day prior
notification period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New &sect;563.22(h)(1) requires the submission of either a letter describing material information regarding the
transaction or a copy of a filing submitted to the regulatory agency of the resulting institution that must approve
the transaction. The rule does not require OTS approval or clearance of such transactions prior to their consummation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the amendments to &sect;563.22(b), the OTS has determined that it is appropriate to revise its application
requirements for voluntary dissolutions of Federal associations set forth at 12 CFR 546.4. Amended &sect;546.4
provides that Federal associations that combine with a bank in a purchase and assumption transaction will not be required
to file a voluntary dissolution application where the transaction involves the transfer of all of the Federal association's
assets and liabilities. The OTS has determined that requiring a voluntary dissolution application would have eliminated
any streamlining arising from the notification process in those circumstances. The Federal stock association will
still be required under &sect;552.13 to surrender its charter upon completion of the transaction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amended &sect;563.22(c) requires prior notice or application to the OTS in accordance with new &sect;563.22(h)(2)
for the following categories of transactions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Purchases of assets by a savings association that do not require OTS approval under the BMA and &sect;563.22(a);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Bulk sales of less than all or substantially all of the assets of a savings association; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Transactions in which a savings association transfers less than all or substantially all of its deposit liabilities
to a bank or other depository institution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Bulk assumptions or transfers of non-deposit liabilities by a savings association; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Combinations involving savings associations and depository institutions other than insured depository institutions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS believes that an abbreviated procedure is appropriate for these types of transactions, provided that the
savings association is well capitalized, and otherwise qualifies for ``expedited treatment'' under part 516. Accordingly,
under new &sect;563.22(h)(2)(i), an expedited notice procedure is available for all five of the foregoing categories
of transactions where all constituent savings associations meet the conditions for ``expedited treatment'' under
12 CFR 516.3(a). Notices under this provision of the rule would be deemed approved automatically 30 days after receipt,
unless the OTS determines that an application is required.

As is the case with respect to any notice receiving expedited treatment under &sect;516.3(a), the OTS may impose appropriate

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under new &sect;&sect;563.22(h)(2)(ii) and 563.22(h)(2)(iii), a standard application procedure must be followed
where any constituent savings association does not meet the criteria for ``expedited treatment'' under &sect;516.3(a),
or where a notice filed under &sect;563.22(h)(2)(i) is incomplete or otherwise does not satisfy the notice requirements.
These applications will be subject to the ``standard'' review periods set forth in part 516, with certain exceptions.
As with other applications, the OTS is required to notify an applicant within 30 calendar days after proper submission
of an application whether it is ``sufficient'' or ``complete,'' and what additional information is required, if
any, in order to render the submission sufficient, or that the submission is materially deficient and will not be processed.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the 60-day period for review for an application under these provisions commences on the date the OTS determines

(g) If a plan of combination provides for a resulting Federal mutual savings association's name or location to be changed,
its charter shall be amended accordingly. If the resulting institution is a Federal mutual savings association,
the effective date of the combination shall be the date specified in the approval; if the resulting institution is
not a Federal savings association, the effective date shall be that prescribed under applicable law. Approval of
a merger automatically cancels the Federal charter of a Federal association that is a disappearing institution as

resulting institution shall be a continuation of the entity which absorbed the disappearing institutions. All rights
and obligations of the disappearing institutions shall remain unimpaired, and the resulting institution shall,

of the conversion, has deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and provided further, that
the depository institution, in accomplishing the conversion, complies with all applicable statutes and regulations,
including, without limitation, section 5(d) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The resulting Federal stock association
must conform within the time prescribed by the OTS to the requirements of section 5(c) of the Home Owners' Loan Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) No savings association may, without application to and approval by the Office: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Combine with any insured depository institution, if the acquiring or resulting institution is to be a savings
association; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assume liability to pay any deposit made in, any insured depository institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) No savings association may, without notifying the Office, as provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Combine with another insured depository institution where a savings association is not the resulting institution;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In the case of a savings association that meets the conditions for expedited treatment under &sect;516.3(a)
of this chapter, convert, directly or indirectly, to a national or state bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No savings association that does not meet the conditions for expedited treatment under &sect;516.3(a) of this
chapter may, directly or indirectly, convert to a national or state bank without prior application to and approval
of the Office, as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) No savings association may make any transfer (excluding transfers subject to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section)
without notice or application to the Office, as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. For purposes of this
paragraph, the term ``transfer'' means purchases or sales of assets or liabilities in bulk not made in the ordinary
course of business including, but not limited to, transfers of assets or savings account liabilities, purchases
of assets, and assumptions of deposit accounts or other liabilities, and combinations with a depository institution
other than an insured depository institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)(1) In determining whether to confer approval for a transaction under paragraphs (a), (b)(2), or (c) of this section,
the Office shall take into account the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The capital level of any resulting savings association; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The financial and managerial resources of the constituent institutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The future prospects of the constituent institutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The convenience and needs of the communities to be served; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The conformity of the transaction to applicable law, regulation, and supervisory policies; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Factors relating to the fairness of and disclosure concerning the transaction, including, but not limited to:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Equitable treatment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The transaction should be equitable to all concerned_savings account holders, borrowers, creditors and stockholders
(if any) of each savings association_giving proper recognition of and protection to their respective legal rights
and interests. The transaction will be closely reviewed for fairness where the transaction does not appear to be the
result of arms' length bargaining or, in the case of a stock savings association, where controlling stockholders
are receiving different consideration from other stockholders. No finder's or similar fee should be paid to any officer,
director, or controlling person of a savings association which is a party to the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Full disclosure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The filing should make full disclosure of all written or oral agreements or understandings by which any person or company
will receive, directly or indirectly, any money, property, service, release of pledges made, or other thing of value,
whether tangible or intangible, in connection with the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compensation to officers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compensation, including deferred compensation, to officers, directors and controlling persons of the disappearing
savings association by the resulting institution or an affiliate thereof should not be in excess of a reasonable amount,
and should be commensurate with their duties and responsibilities. The filing should fully justify the compensation
to be paid to such persons. The transaction will be particularly scrutinized where any of such persons is to receive
a material increase in compensation above that paid by the disappearing savings association prior to the commencement
of negotiations regarding the proposed transaction. An increase in compensation in excess of the greater of 15% or
$10,000 gives rise to presumptions of unreasonableness and sale of control. In the case of such an increase, evidence
sufficient to rebut such presumptions should be submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Advisory boards. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Advisory board members should be elected for a term not exceeding one year. No advisory board fees should be paid to
salaried officers or employees of the resulting savings association. The filing should describe and justify the
duties and responsibilities and any compensation paid to any advisory board of the resulting savings association
that consists of officers, directors or controlling persons of the disappearing institution, particularly if the
disappearing institution experienced significant supervisory problems prior to the transaction. No advisory
board fees should exceed the director fees paid by the resulting savings association. Advisory board fees that are
in excess of 115 percent of the director fees paid by the disappearing savings association prior to commencement of
negotiations regarding the transaction give rise to presumptions of unreasonableness and sale of control unless
sufficient evidence to rebut such presumptions is submitted. Rebuttal evidence is not required if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The advisory board fees do not exceed the fee that advisory board members of the resulting institution receive
for each monthly meeting attended or $150, whichever is greater; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the advisory board fees do not exceed $100 per meeting attended for disappearing savings associations with assets
greater than $10,000,000 or $50 per meeting attended for disappearing savings associations with assets of $10,000,000
or less, based on a schedule of 12 meetings per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The accounting and tax treatment of the transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) Fees paid and professional services rendered in connection with the transaction.

(2) In conferring approval of a transaction under paragraph (a) of this section, the Office also will consider the
competitive impact of the transaction, including whether:

 SIP, which includes the Lincoln County Air Pollution Control Program, as revised by the State of Montana on March 19,
1993, and submitted by the Governor of Montana to EPA on May 24, 1993, with the exception of contingency measures. Final
technical corrections to the SIP were sent to EPA with a letter dated June 3, 1994. This submittal replaced earlier
submittals, detailed as follows:

The Libby PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP was originally adopted by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences (MBHES) on November 15, 1991,
and submitted to EPA by the Governor on November 25, 1991. To address deficiencies identified by EPA, commitments
were adopted by the State after a public hearing on December 21, 1992, and submitted to EPA on January 13, 1993, as additional
tasks to be completed to correct the deficiencies in the Libby and statewide SIP. The commitments relevant to the moderate
PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area SIP requirements due November 15, 1991, were fulfilled through SIP revisions adopted by the MBHES
on March 19, 1993, and submitted by the Governor of Montana to EPA on May 24, 1993. In his cover letter, the Governor said
that this May 24, 1993, submittal should replace the documents submitted in November 1991. Final technical corrections
to the SIP were sent to EPA in a letter dated June 3, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The May 24, 1993, submittal also included contingency measure provisions. In a May 27, 1994, letter from Douglas M.
Skie (EPA) to Jeff Chaffee (Montana Air Quality Bureau, MAQB), EPA advised the State that additional language concerning
triggering of the contingency measures would be needed in the local regulations. EPA will propose separate action
on the contingency measures once the State has incorporated the necessary changes, and submitted the revised SIP
element to EPA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-66). In today's
action, EPA is granting approval of those elements of the Libby PM

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. EPA also must determine whether a
submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565).
EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. EPA attempts to make completeness
determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of
law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after receipt of the submission.

To entertain public comment on the implementation plan for Libby, the State of Montana, after providing adequate
notice, held a public hearing on November 15, 1991, to address the local air pollution control program and the Libby
SIP. Following the public hearing, the local air pollution control plan and the Libby PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP were adopted by the State. The Governor of Montana submitted the SIP to EPA on November 25, 1991. The SIP submittal
was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V. The submittal was found to be complete, and a letter dated April 29, 1992, was forwarded to the Governor
indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to EPA comments regarding PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIPs for other Montana nonattainment areas, the State included commitments with the November 25, 1991, Libby submittal
to address statewide deficiencies (New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration regulations, test
methods, and an operating permit program), along with Libby-specific commitments regarding revising the attainment
and maintenance demonstrations to properly handle background concentrations and to correct wood-burning program
calculations, clarifying that the state emergency episode plan applies in Libby, and adopting contingency measures.
In an October 7, 1992, letter from Doug Skie, EPA to Jeff Chaffee, MAQB, EPA notified the State that its commitments
would need to be taken through the public hearing process, which would delay EPA's approvability determination.
The State held a public hearing on December 21, 1992, and resubmitted the commitments as an official Governor's submittal
in a letter dated January 13, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 19, 1993, the State of Montana, after providing adequate notice, held a public hearing to entertain public
comment on revisions to the Libby PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP to satisfy several of the Governor's commitments, as discussed above. Following the public hearing, the revisions
to the local air pollution control plan and the Libby PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP were adopted by the State. The Governor of Montana submitted the revised SIP to EPA on May 24, 1993. This submittal
was deemed to be complete six months later on November 24, 1993. The Acting Administrator of EPA Region VIII sent a letter
to the Governor on January 4, 1994, documenting that the submittal was deemed to be complete, and that EPA did review
the May 24, 1993, Libby PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP submittal and found that it met the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The Governor's submittal
letter stated that this new submittal should replace the November 25, 1991, SIP submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, the State has fulfilled all remaining Governor's commitments. EPA is preparing separate actions
on submittals addressing the statewide commitments (New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration
regulations, test methods, and an operating permit program). A detailed description of the Libby commitments is
contained in the TSD for this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this final rule action, EPA is announcing its approval of the revised Montana PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

2. Accurate Emission Inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current
inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emission inventory
also should include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area. Because
the submission of such inventories is a necessary adjunct to an area's attainment demonstration (or demonstration
that the area cannot practicably attain), the emission inventories must be received with the submission (see 57 FR
13539). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Libby's base year emissions inventory was developed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 31, 1987, through November 30, 1988. The results were as follows. Annually, area sources account for 70.8%
of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions, with re-entrained road dust the largest contributor at 62.4%. Residential wood burning, another area
source, accounts for 7.6% of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions in the Libby area. The Stimson Lumber Company
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sawmill and plywood plant is the largest point source, contributing 29.2% of the Libby area emissions. Two-thirds
of its contribution is attributable to fugitive dust.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The emission inventory shows that the emissions are seasonal, with re-entrained road dust the primary source in spring
and summer. Industry is the most important source category in the fall and winter. However, fugitive dust accounts
for a large portion of the industrial emissions: 56.6% in the summer, 48.2% in the fall, and 18.2% in the winter. Re-entrained
road dust is the major area source during the spring (83.7%), summer (53.9%), and fall (41.7%), and residential wood
combustion is the major area source in the winter (27.3%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is approving the emissions inventory because it is accurate and comprehensive and provides a sufficient basis
for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements of sections
172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels which exceed the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). The General Preamble contains guidance
addressing how EPA intends to implement section 189(e) (57 FR 13539&hyph;13540 and 13541&hyph;13542). An analysis
of air quality and emissions data for the Libby nonattainment area indicates that exceedances of the NAAQS are attributable
chiefly to direct particulate emissions from re-entrained road dust and residential wood burning (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 area sources). Neither the emissions inventory nor the CMB analysis for Libby revealed any major stationary sources
of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 precursors. Consequently, EPA has determined that major sources of precursors of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 do not contribute significantly to PM

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels in excess of the NAAQS. The consequence of this finding is to exclude any such sources from the applicability
of PM

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area control requirements. Further discussion of the analyses and supporting rationale for EPA's
finding are contained in the TSD accompanying this notice. Note that while EPA is making a general finding for this
area, today's finding is based on the current character of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources
in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area.
EPA intends to issue future guidance addressing the effect of such potential changes in the significance of precursor
emissions in an area.

6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones which are to
be achieved every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as defined in section
171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). RFP is defined in section 171(l) as
such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by Part D or may reasonably
be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable
date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While section 189(c) plainly provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved until an area is redesignated
attainment, it is silent in indicating the starting point for counting the first 3-year period or how many milestones
must be initially addressed. In the General Preamble, EPA addressed the statutory gap in the starting point for counting
the 3-year milestones, indicating that it would begin from the due date for the applicable implementation plan revision
containing the control measures for the area (i.e., November 15, 1991, for initial moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As to the number of milestones, EPA believes that at least two milestones must be initially addressed. Thus, submittals
to address the SIP revisions due on November 15, 1991, for the initial moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas must demonstrate that at least two milestones will be achieved (1st milestone: November 15,
1991, through November 15, 1994; 2nd milestone: November 15, 1994, through November 15, 1997).

For the initial PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas that demonstrate timely attainment, the emissions reduction progress made between the SIP
submittal (due date of November 15, 1991) and the attainment date will satisfy the first quantitative milestone.
See 57 FR 13539. For areas that demonstrate timely attainment of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS, the milestones beyond the attainment achievement date should, at a minimum, provide for continued maintenance
of the standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 189(c) provides that quantitative milestones are to be achieved ``until the area is redesignated attainment.''
However, this endpoint for quantitative milestones is speculative because redesignation of an area as attainment
is contingent upon several factors and future events. Therefore, EPA believes it is reasonable for States to initially
address at least the first two milestones. Addressing two milestones will ensure that the State continues to maintain
the NAAQS beyond the attainment date for at least some period during which an area could be redesignated attainment.
However, in all instances, additional milestones must be addressed if an area is not redesignated attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated previously, the SIP for the Libby nonattainment area demonstrates attainment of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. The SIP also demonstrates that the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS will be maintained in future years by predicting a 24-hour design concentration of 137.1

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the year 1998. Therefore, EPA is approving the submittal as meeting the quantitative milestone requirement currently
due. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assurance that milestones and reasonable further progress will be achieved is based upon the State adopting and
implementing the particular control measures contained in the SIP which are addressed in Section II.A.3, ``RACM
(including RACT),'' of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, once a milestone has passed, the State will have to demonstrate that the milestone was, in fact, achieved
for the Libby area as provided in section 189(c)(2) of the Act. The State of Montana's PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP indicates that the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences (MDHES) and the Lincoln County Health
Department (LCHD) will submit to EPA a milestone report consistent with federal guidelines by December 31, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All exceedances of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard will be evaluated and a determination made as to the source of the exceedance. Changes in the air quality program
to prevent further exceedances and a timetable for implementation will be developed. Any other EPA requirements
for RFP reports will be incorporated as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Enforceability Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6) and 110(a)(2)(A)
of the Act and 57 FR 13556). The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in
a September 23, 1987, memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions also must contain a program to provide for enforcement of control
measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific control measures contained in the SIP are addressed above in section II.A.3, ``RACM (including RACT).''
The Lincoln County air pollution control ordinances, as included in the SIP, are legally enforceable by LCHD. There
are penalties for noncompliance with the mandatory solid fuel burning device regulation that are $25 for the third
and subsequent violations. There are also penalties for violation of any provision of the open burning regulation
that are: a fine not less than $10 and not more than $200 for each offense, except for burning hazardous wastes (as defined
by 40 CFR part 261), which carries a penalty of a fine not to exceed $10,000 for each offense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Lincoln County Air Pollution Control Program and the associated local regulations are also enforceable by the
MDHES, if the LCHD fails to administer the program. Since the program has been approved by the MBHES in accordance with
section 75&hyph;2&hyph;301 of the Montana Clean Air Act and effectuated by a MBHES order, and since the MDHES can enforce
MBHES orders, the MDHES has independent enforcement powers. Enforcement provisions are found in the Clean Air Act
of Montana, sections 75&hyph;2&hyph;401&hyph;429, Montana Code Annotated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emission limits for the Stimson Lumber Company facility are enforceable by the MDHES through air quality permit

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2627&hyph;M with a final modification date of July 25, 1991. Section 75&hyph;2&hyph;401 of the Montana Clean Air
Act allows the MDHES to seek civil penalties for a violation of a permit limitation. Administrative Rules of Montana
(ARM) 16.8.1112 allows the MDHES to revoke a permit for a violation of a permit limitation. These regulations are contained
in the ARM 16.8.101 through 16.8.1602 and violations of these rules are punishable by civil penalties in an amount
up to $10,000 per day and criminal penalties in an amount up to $1,000 per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State relies on a local government for the implementation of any plan provision, then, according to section 110(a)(2)(E)(iii)
of the Act, the State must provide necessary assurances that the State has responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation
of such plan provision. A State would have responsibility to ensure adequate implementation when, for example, the
State has the authority and resources to implement the provision, and the local entity has failed to do so.

The Lincoln County Air Pollution Control Program was established in accordance with the requirements of section
75&hyph;2&hyph;301 of the Montana Clean Air Act, as amended (1991). A stipulation between the MDHES, the Lincoln
County Commission and the Libby City Council was signed on March 18, 1993, to delineate responsibilities and authorities
between the MDHES and the local authorities. On March 19, 1993, the MBHES held a public hearing and (a) approved the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

The ordinances, stipulation, and board order were submitted to EPA with the Libby PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State also submitted a State Assistant Attorney General's opinion interpreting the authority of the MDHES to
enforce any state and local air quality provisions if a local air quality program fails to do so. In practice, the MBHES
issues a board order when it approves a local program or amendments to a program. Since the Montana Clean Air Act authorizes
the MDHES to enforce board orders issued by the MBHES, the MDHES has the authority to assume jurisdiction over, and
implement, a local program so approved. However, the Montana Clean Air Act also requires a hearing before the MBHES
before such an assumption of jurisdiction and authority can be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

and funding intended to support effective implementation of the control measures.

8. Contingency Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIPs that demonstrate attainment must
include contingency measures. See generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 57 FR 13543&hyph;13544. These measures
were required to be submitted by November 15, 1993, for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures
should consist of other available measures that are not part of the area's control strategy. These measures must take
effect without further action by the State or EPA, upon EPA's determination that the area has failed to make RFP or attain
the PM

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Libby nonattainment area SIP contains contingency measures that address re-entrained road dust (use of liquid
de-icer and expansion of sanding and sweeping area to Air Pollution Control District boundaries) and residential
wood combustion (prohibiting burning except under specified permits for the entire period between October 1 and
March 31 each year). In a May 27, 1994, letter from Doug Skie, EPA, to Jeff Chaffee, MAQB, EPA advised the State that additional
language was needed in the triggering mechanism for the contingency measures. The State is working with the local
governments and health department to adopt the necessary changes. EPA will take separate action on the Libby PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contingency measures. See the TSD for this action for a more detailed discussion of the contingency measure deficiencies.

III. Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP submitted to EPA on May 24, 1993, with final technical corrections dated June 3, 1994, for the Libby, Montana nonattainment
area, with the exception of the contingency measures. Among other things, the State of Montana has demonstrated that
the Libby moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area will attain the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. EPA is also approving the Lincoln County Air Pollution Control Program, which was included
in the Libby SIP submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because EPA considers this action noncontroversial and anticipates no adverse comments, this final approval is
made without prior proposal. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective October 31, 1994 unless, by September 29, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this
action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received,
the public is advised that this action will be effective October 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted, additional submittals for the initial moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, nonattainment new source review program requirements) are due independent of the SIP requirements addressed in
this action. EPA will determine the adequacy of any such submittal as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OMB has exempted this action from review under Executive Order 12866.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation
of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of a state
action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 16, 1994, the final rule establishing the requirements for reformulated gasoline (RFG), and the anti-dumping
provisions for conventional gasoline, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 59 FR 7716. In response to this final rule, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) received numerous questions
regarding the Agency's plans for implementing and assuring compliance with the RFG and anti-dumping regulations.
The Agency has prepared a document which responds to these questions, titled ``Reformulated Gasoline and Anti-Dumping
Question and Answers_July 1, 1994.'' This notice announces the availability of the RFG/anti-dumping regulations
question and answer document, and provides instructions for accessing this document, and other RFG-related documents,
on the Technology Transfer Network Bulletin Board System (TTNBBS). These instructions were widely distributed
on July 1, 1994; however, we are publishing this notice for the benefit of interested persons not on our mailing list.
Finally, it is our intention to make available on the TTNBBS, on a periodic basis, responses to any additional questions
received by the Agency.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region II, announces the deletion of the Wide Beach Development site
from the NPL. The NPL is Appendix B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP),
which EPA promulgated pursuant to Section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act (CERCLA), as amended. EPA and the State of New York have determined that all appropriate Hazardous Substance Response
Trust Fund (Fund)-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented and that no further cleanup by responsible
parties is appropriate. Moreover, EPA and the State of New York have determined that remedial actions conducted at
the site to date have been protective of public health, welfare, and the environment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The site to be deleted from the NPL is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wide Beach Development site, Brant, New York.

The closing date for comments on the Notice of Intent to Delete was April 30, 1994. EPA received two comment letters.
One commentor suggested that deleting the site from the NPL at this time is premature, because he believes that an on-site
wetland was not properly restored and because the owner of the restored wetland has cut down some trees and shrubs located
on the wetland. The commentor also suggested that the site not be deleted from the NPL since a number of contractual
claims have not been resolved with the remedial action contractor. The second commentor expressed concern about
the possible instability of the treated soil that was used as fill on a portion of her property. This commentor also
expressed concern about possible problems disposing of the treated soil, in the event that a home were to be built on
her property. EPA's response to the first commentor is that the design of the wetlands restoration was performed by
an experienced landscape architect and biologist and that the restored wetland is the functional equivalent of the
original wetland. EPA also noted that, because of its small size, this wetland is not covered by New York State wetland
regulations; and since it is an isolated wetland and of limited size, disturbances of up to one acre do not require a
federal permit. Therefore, the land owner's removal of trees and shrubs from the restored wetland is not in violation
of state or federal wetland regulations. In addition, EPA indicated that, since the unresolved claims are contractual
issues, they are not relevant to deleting the site from the NPL. To the second commentor, EPA noted that the treated
soil has been stable since 1991, and that, since the treated soil is nonhazardous, it could be disposed of in the same
manner as any other excavated, nonhazardous soils. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA identifies sites which appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and
it maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of Fund-financed remedial actions.
Any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions in the unlikely event that conditions
at the site warrant such action. Section 300.425 (e)(3) of the NCP states that Fund-financed actions may be taken at
sites deleted from the NPL. Deletion of a site from the NPL does not affect responsible party liability or impede EPA's
efforts to recover costs associated with response efforts.

would provide a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay for such services. The revisions below amend
the rules to permit facilities that provide substantial free or below cost medical services but nonetheless cannot
receive credit for such services under current requirements with an alternative method of compliance that will enable
them to fulfill their uncompensated services obligations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 4, 1993, the Secretary of Health and Human Services published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing
to revise the rules governing what is popularly known as the Hill-Burton uncompensated services program. 58 FR 58828.
Health care facilities covered by the program received construction assistance under two titles of the Public Health
Service Act, Title VI (the ``Hill-Burton Act'', 42 U.S.C. 291, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and Title XVI (42 U.S.C. 300q, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). Under both titles, facilities receiving construction assistance have been required, as a condition of receiving
the construction assistance, to provide an assurance that ``there will be available in the facility or portion thereof
to be constructed or modernized a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor *&blank;*&blank;*.''
42 U.S.C. 291c(e)(2). See also 42 U.S.C. 300s-1(b)(1)(K)(ii). This assurance is known as the ``uncompensated services
assurance.''

Background of the Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The groundwork of the present uncompensated services compliance requirements was laid by comprehensive regulations
that were issued in 1979. 44 FR 29372 (May 18, 1979). The 1979 regulations established numerous compliance requirements
for uncompensated services programs. These included requirements for a minimum level of uncompensated services
to be provided by facilities, an annual compliance level (ACL) of uncompensated services to be provided, make-up
of any deficit in meeting the ACL, national eligibility criteria for determining who is unable to pay, notice requirements,
requirements regarding the timing and documentation of eligibility determinations, reporting and recordkeeping
requirements, and so on.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When experience with the 1979 regulations showed that they created substantial compliance problems for a number
of public facilities, which were amassing large deficits despite serving large numbers of indigent patients on a
free or below cost basis, the regulations were amended. A compliance alternative for public facilities, which is
codified at 42 CFR 124.513, was created. 51 FR 33208 (Sept. 18, 1986). The public facility compliance alternative
provides that a publicly owned and operated facility or quasi-public facility may be certified if it provides health
services to eligible persons under a program of discounted health services and either received for the past three
fiscal years at least 10 percent of its total operating revenue from state and/or local sources to cover operating
deficits attributable to the provision of discounted health services, or provided in those fiscal years uncompensated
services or free or discounted health services in an amount equal to or greater than twice the facility's annual compliance
level. The facility must comply with separate reporting and recordkeeping requirements and is required only to comply
with the requirements relating to certified facilities. A facility may make up previously assessed deficits by showing
that it met the conditions for certification in the deficit period; a Title VI facility may also make up a previously
assessed deficit by remaining certified after its original period of obligation for a period equal to the deficit
period, while a Title XVI facility that cannot show that it met the conditions of certification in the deficit period
must make up any remaining deficit whenever its certification is withdrawn. A facility with an unassessed deficit
may submit an independent certified audit to establish that no, or a lesser, deficit exists.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1987, the Secretary again revised the 1979 regulations. 52 FR 46022 (Dec. 3, 1987). As pertinent here, an additional
compliance alternative for facilities with annual obligations of $10,000 or less was created. See &sect;124.514.
This alternative was adopted to bring the administrative costs of compliance for such facilities more into line with
the actual level of uncompensated services available, with the requirements applicable under &sect;124.514 resembling
those applicable under the public facility compliance alternative.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, the Secretary proposed an additional compliance alternative designed to address the compliance problems
of another class of facilities whose operational characteristics have created intractable compliance problems,
but which cannot qualify for the existing compliance alternatives. Many of these facilities provide substantial
amounts of free or below cost services, generally because they were created to provide services at no or a nominal charge
to all persons, or they serve an indigent population that is entirely covered by third-party programs such as Medicaid.
These facilities, which are generally private, nonprofit organizations, include facilities such as sheltered
workshops, crippled children rehabilitation facilities, cerebral palsy centers, chronic disease hospitals,
Goodwill Centers, facilities for the blind, mental health centers, and Easter Seal Centers. Based on experience
monitoring such facilities' compliance with the uncompensated services regulations since 1979, the Department
determined that many such facilities have accumulated large uncompensated services deficits, typically because
their policies of not charging or of serving populations covered under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governmental indigent care programs preclude receiving credit under the uncompensated services regulations for
the free and below cost care they in fact provide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department identified 180 private, nonprofit outpatient, rehabilitation, and community mental health center
facilities with outstanding uncompensated services obligations which were likely to have provided a large volume
of free or below cost care while receiving little or no uncompensated services credit. A survey of 28 of these confirmed
that there are a number of facilities for which compliance with the uncompensated services requirements is difficult
or impossible, given their charging policies, legal requirements applicable to their operations, characteristics
of their patient populations, or some combination of these factors, but which clearly provide health services without
regard to ability to pay.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Secretary proposed to adopt a compliance alternative for private, nonprofit facilities which
provide a substantial amount of services without regard to ability to pay, but which find it difficult, if not impossible,
to comply with the present uncompensated services requirements. The proposed compliance alternative was substantially
similar to the public facility compliance alternative with respect to requirements for reporting, recordkeeping,
and the make-up of deficits. However, the eligibility criteria differed somewhat. Under the proposed rule, a facility
could qualify for the compliance alternative if it was a private, nonprofit entity falling into one of two categories:
either (1) it received no monies directly from patients with incomes up to twice the poverty level (exclusive of certain
deductible and coinsurance amounts and other required collections), or (2) it received for the three most recent
fiscal years at least 10 percent of its non-Medicaid and non-Medicare operating revenue from philanthropic sources
to cover operating deficits and either provided services under a ``program of discounted health services'' or provided
all services to all persons at no or a nominal charge (exclusive of certain deductible and coinsurance amounts and
other required collections). With respect to the first category, the NPRM stated that in the Department's view those
facilities that collect no monies from patients with incomes up to twice the poverty level are meeting the statute's
objectives. Similarly, with respect to the second category, the proposed percentage of private philanthropic support
was considered to be a proxy for tax support in the public facility context, as such monies are generally contributed
to fund services which are deemed essential or worthwhile, but which are not self-supporting. The ``program of discounted
health services'' criterion is analogous to a similar criterion in the public facility compliance alternative,
and reflects a recognition that many such facilities have in place a mechanism for determining eligibility for such
services by screening for ability to pay. The rationale for the other criterion is self-evident: Clearly, facilities
that provide all services at no or a nominal charge are adequately serving those in their patient population who are
unable to pay. The NPRM also solicited comment on whether the compliance alternative should be expanded to cover public
facilities that do not qualify for the public facility compliance alternative but whose operational characteristics
are similar to the private, nonprofit entities the alternative would cover.

The Department received 23 comments on the proposed rules, principally from rehabilitation and other facilities
and provider associations. While most of the comments received were in favor of the proposed compliance alternative
in principle, many suggested specific changes to the proposed policies. The comments and the Department's responses

a. Inclusion of Public Facilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters recommended that the criteria for certification be changed to permit the inclusion of public
facilities that otherwise meet the criteria for certification. They argued that there is operationally no difference
between such facilities and non-profit facilities that meet the criteria, and that it is unreasonable to penalize
public facilities just because they are public. The Department agrees with these comments and has changed the rules
accordingly, by eliminating proposed &sect;124.516(b)(1), which would have restricted the compliance alternative
to private, nonprofit facilities.

b. No Monies Received From the Indigent
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;124.516(b)(2) would have established, as one alternative criterion for certification, that a facility
received no monies directly from persons with incomes up to twice the poverty level, exclusive of amounts charged
or received for purposes of obtaining reimbursement under third party programs. Several commenters urged that this
criterion be revised to permit receipt of funds from such persons, on the grounds that it is unrealistic to expect a
facility to receive 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
no
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 money from such persons. It was suggested that the criterion be revised to permit receipt of funds up to some amount,
such as 10 percent of operating revenues. The Department has not accepted this suggestion. This criterion was intended
to accommodate those exceptional facilities which routinely provide all services at no charge to persons unable
to pay or which entirely serve populations ineligible for uncompensated services and are thus unable to comply with
the regulations. Facilities that collect monies from patients with incomes below twice the poverty level do not come
within the intent of this criterion. It should be noted, however, that such facilities may nonetheless be able to qualify
for the compliance alternative under a different criterion of the regulation, if they have a ``program of discounted
health services'' and receive the requisite amount of philanthropy. See &sect;124.516(b)(2) below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another suggestion made with respect to this criterion was that amounts collected from patients as part of their Medicaid
``spenddown'' be considered to be included under the exclusionary language of this section, so that collection of
such monies by a facility would not render it ineligible under this criterion. This suggestion has likewise not been
accepted. Spenddown amounts are clearly not within the scope of the exclusionary language as written, as Medicaid
eligibility does not exist until the patient has spent down the requisite amount, and therefore they are not amounts
charged that are reimbursable. Nor do we think the language should be revised to permit inclusion of spenddown amounts
in the amounts permitted to be charged or claimed. As stated above, this criterion is intended to cover a narrow class
of facilities_ones which can be considered to be meeting their Hill-Burton obligation because they are in fact not
receiving monies directly from any patients who would otherwise be eligible for Hill-Burton uncompensated services.
Permitting collection of spenddown amounts would thus not be consistent with the intended scope of this criterion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This criterion has been revised, however, to require that the facility demonstrate that it met the criterion for the
preceding three fiscal years. This revision brings this criterion into line with the 10 percent philanthropy criterion
of &sect;124.516(b)(2), which also requires a demonstration of compliance over the preceding three years. The purpose
of the three-year demonstration in both cases is to give the Secretary a basis for the conclusion that a facility applying
for certification in fact comes within the intended scope of the compliance alternative because of its characteristics
and problems, and that certification is not made based on what may be a one-time aberration in the facility's circumstances.
See &sect;124.516(b)(1) below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested that, in view of the difficulty many nursing homes have in finding individuals who are
eligible for uncompensated services and not also eligible for Medicaid, the Department create a new eligibility
category for persons in nursing homes with incomes up to four times the poverty level. In fact, the Secretary is considering
such a change to the regulations; an NPRM proposing to establish a new ``Category C,'' consisting of persons with incomes
up to three times the poverty level was recently published. 59 FR 15693 (April 4, 1994). It should be noted that, should
this latter policy subsequently be adopted, the Secretary would expect to revise &sect;124.516(b)(1) below to be
consistent with the revision in the underlying regulations.

c. Definition of ``Philanthropy''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the elimination of the restriction of the compliance alternative to private facilities, the Department
has also broadened the examples of ``philanthropy'' in the new &sect;124.516(b)(2)(i). As revised, the term ``philanthropy''
includes state and/or local funding, as it is anticipated that most philanthropic funding for public facilities
will originate from such sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``philanthropy'' has also been clarified by the addition of the phrase ``to cover operating deficits attributable
to the provision of discounted services.'' The added words, among other things, make clear that philanthropic state
or local funding within the scope of this section is different than state or local funds received under entitlement
programs, which have long been considered not to be ``uncompensated services''; see &sect;124.505(a). The additional
language imposes a similar restriction on other forms of philanthropy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the term ``philanthropy'' be further revised to include interest earned on donated
funds. However, since it is the Department's view that interest on donated funds is clearly from a ``philanthropic
source,'' further clarification of the regulation in this respect is not needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
d. Program of Discounted Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One provider group opposed the eligibility criterion permitting certification where a facility has a ``program
of discounted services.'' The group argued that this provision would create a problem under Medicaid and Medicare,
the rules of which prohibit those programs from subsidizing other patients. The Department does not believe that
this is a problem, since the discounts made to patients under a facility's discounted health services program are
not required to be reflected in charges to those programs. Certainly, this has not proved to be a problem with facilities
operating under the general compliance requirements or with facilities certified under the public facility compliance
alternative, which contains the same eligibility criterion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``program of discounted health services'' has been revised, however, by the addition of language
making clear that charges may be made under such a program for the purpose of obtaining third party reimbursements.
This policy was discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule, but was omitted from the proposed rule itself. The change
simply makes the policy of this section consistent with the policy throughout the remainder of the subpart that third
party collections are to be encouraged. See &sect;124.505(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
e. No or Nominal Charge Policies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section has likewise been revised by the addition of the language discussed in the preceding paragraph. One comment
questioned the criterion set out in the proposed rules pertaining to making ``all services of the facility available
to all persons at no or a nominal charge.'' It expressed the concern that a hospital could qualify for the compliance
alternative under this criterion simply by designating some narrow group of services, then making them available
for free or at a nominal charge, while continuing to charge everyone fully for the facility's other services. We do
not share the commenter's concern, as the rule below expressly states that, in order to come within this criterion,
the facility must ``make[ ] all services of the facility available to all persons *&blank;*&blank;*'' See &sect;124.516(b)(2)(ii)(B)
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
f. Other Eligibility Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other proposals for eligibility criteria were received. Several commenters suggested that a facility's Medicaid
census be a basis for eligibility; these commenters suggested that facilities with a 70 percent or greater Medicaid
census be eligible for the compliance alternative. One commenter suggested that long-term care facilities with
characteristics ``similar'' to the proposed eligibility criteria likewise be considered to be eligible for the
compliance alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not persuaded that it should create a special eligibility criterion based on a facility's Medicaid/Medicare
census. Clearly, those facilities that serve large numbers of Medicaid or Medicare recipients are not precluded
from qualifying under one of the criteria below, if they in fact meet those criteria. Indeed, we do not think it would
be consistent with the theory underlying the compliance alternative to craft such an eligibility criterion. The
theory of the compliance alternative is that the facilities who come within it need the alternative because compliance
with the general compliance standards is difficult, if not impossible, for them because of their operational characteristics,
even though they are clearly providing free or below cost services to ``persons unable to pay.'' However, compliance
with the general compliance standards is not impossible for a facility with a 70 percent Medicaid/Medicare census
which charges the remaining 30 percent of its patient population. After all, if none of the remaining 30 percent of
the facility's patient population meets the eligibility criteria of &sect;124.505, the facility will qualify for
the compliance alternative under &sect;124.516(b)(1) below. Thus, it must be assumed that the intent of the proposed
revision would be to permit facilities to qualify for the compliance alternative even though they charge patients
who meet the Hill-Burton eligibility criteria and who thus could be provided uncompensated services.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the comment regarding long-term care facilities, the Department has not created a special criterion
for such facilities. If such facilities meet the eligibility criteria below, they may be certified under the new compliance
alternative. We note, moreover, that the proposed change in eligibility criteria for nursing homes may well relieve
some of the particular difficulties of nursing homes in complying with the general compliance standards.

2. Documentation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments expressed support for minimizing the reporting and recordkeeping required of qualifying facilities
under the proposed compliance alternative. One hospital, however, opposed the proposed rules on the grounds that
they simply created an additional layer of reporting and recordkeeping requirements, stating that the existing
requirements work well. It should be emphasized that the compliance alternative is not meant to create an additional
set of requirements for facilities already complying with the general compliance requirements at &sect;&sect;124.501&hyph;124.512;
rather, the compliance alternative below is designed to relieve facilities which qualify for it from the burden of
complying with the general compliance requirements. Consistent with this approach, the reporting and recordkeeping
required for qualifying facilities is different from that required of most facilities and should generally be considerably
less than that under the general compliance standards. In any event, a facility that is not certified under the compliance
alternative does not have to comply with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements applicable to those facilities
which are certified; concommitantly, a facility that is certified under the compliance alternative is not required
to comply with reporting and recordkeeping requirements other than those that apply to certified facilities. A facility
always has the option of continuing to comply with the general compliance requirements; it can thus ignore the compliance
alternative completely if it decides that compliance with the general compliance requirements makes more sense
for it. Thus, we do not think that this particular concern is justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A couple of commenters pointed out that the proposed means of demonstrating that a facility meets the eligibility
criteria_through audited financial statements_would not necessarily suffice, depending on the criterion involved.
They pointed out that, for example, audited financial statements do not necessarily set forth philanthropic sources
in the level of detail required, or establish a facility's charging policies. They suggested that the rule be amended
to require facilities to contract for such information as part of their audits. The Department agrees with the observation
made about the limitations of audited financial statements, but does not agree with the remedy proposed. Rather,
it is our view that documentation sufficient to establish sources of philanthropy, charging practices and so on can
be provided by other means, and we are reluctant to put facilities to the added expense of contracting for audit services
that they would not otherwise need. Thus, &sect;124.516(c)(1) below has been revised to add a requirement for ``other
documents'' to cover the concern raised by the commenters. The Department will issue program instructions clarifying
what other documents may be required in specific instances.

3. Deficits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that the proposed rules be revised to permit facilities to treat deficits resulting from
Medicaid underpayments as justifiable deficits. However, we are not accepting this comment, as it is not pertinent
to the compliance alternative. The rules below do not distinguish between types of deficits for purposes of deficit
make-up under the alternative, unlike the general compliance requirements, which do draw such a distinction. Compare
&sect;124.516(d)(2) below with &sect;124.503(b). Thus, under the compliance alternative, a certified facility
with a noncompliance deficit may make up the deficit in precisely the same manner as a certified facility with a justifiable
deficit.

4. Other Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments questioned whether vocational services could be counted as uncompensated services under the compliance
alternative; the facilities concerned stated that they have difficulty meeting the ACL since they do not receive
credit for vocational services they provide. The compliance alternative below should relieve this problem for facilities
that are certified, however. Certified facilities will not have to provide a set amount of uncompensated services,
unlike facilities operating under the general compliance requirements. Thus, so long as certified facilities provide
some medical services and otherwise remain in compliance with the requirements for certification, they will be considered
to be in compliance with their uncompensated services assurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the fact that the rules below relieve restrictions on facilities that apply and are certified for the compliance
alternative and impose no additional duties or obligations on other facilities, delay in the effective date of these
rules is not required under 5 U.S.C. 553. For the same reasons, the Secretary hereby finds that good cause exists for
not delaying the effective date of the rules below. The rules are accordingly effective upon publication.

Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule below would generally maintain the existing procedural and reporting requirements for the majority of obligated
facilities, but significantly lessen them for certain private, nonprofit or public facilities. The Department
has determined that the impact would not approach the annual $100 million threshold for major economic consequences
as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory impact analysis is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Secretary certifies that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule contains information collections which have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, and assigned control

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
0915&hyph;0171.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The underlying purpose of this rule is to decrease recordkeeping, reporting, and notification burden for the charitable
facilities. Facilities certified under the charitable facility compliance alternative will no longer be required
to maintain extensive records on uncompensated services (124.510(a)), but instead will have to maintain only records
which document its eligibility for the compliance alternative (124.510(b)). We believe this recordkeeping requirement
imposes no additional burden because these documents are ordinarily retained by facilities. This change is expected
to reduce the recordkeeping burden by 75 hours per facility per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, reporting burden will be reduced. Charitable facilities will be required to apply once for the certification
(124.516(c)), and thereafter will need only to certify their continued eligibility annually (124.509(b)). Currently,
facilities in deficit status, which include most of the charitable facilities, must file a report each year which
documents the amount of uncompensated care provided (124.509(a)). This change in reporting requirements is expected
to reduce the reporting burden by 6 hours per facility in the first year, and by 13.5 hours per facility in subsequent
years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, notification/disclosure burden will be eliminated, because the facilities will no longer be required
to: (1) Publish a notice each year of the availability of uncompensated services (124.504(a)); (2) provide individual
written notices to each person seeking service in the facility (124.504(c)); or (3) provide a determination of eligibility
to each person applying for uncompensated services (124.507). These changes are expected to reduce the notification
burden by 380 hours per facility per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All sections of the regulations that contain reporting, recordkeeping, or notification/disclosure requirements
have been approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act (OMB)

with an estimate of the annual reporting and recordkeeping burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the collection of information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of the requirement for ``other documents'' in &sect;124.516(c)(1) will not affect the burden because
the other documents are expected to be readily available materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimate of 150 applicants was based on a review, prior to development of the NPRM, of data on the kinds of facilities
expected to qualify for the alternative. A recent re-review of the list of facilities indicated that 30 of the facilities
have completed their obligations. With the addition of public facilities in the qualifying criteria, we expect approximately
30 additional facilities to apply for certification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A facility may qualify for certification under this section if it meets the criteria of either paragraph (b)(1) or
paragraph (b)(2) of this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It received, for the three most recent fiscal years, no monies directly from patients with incomes up to double
the current poverty line issued by the Secretary pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9902, exclusive of amounts charged or received
for purposes of claiming reimbursement under third party insurance or governmental programs, such as Medicaid or
Medicare deductible or coinsurance amounts; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) It received, for the three most recent fiscal years, at least 10 percent of its total operating revenue (net
patient revenue plus other operating revenue, exclusive of any amounts received, or if not received, claimed, as
reimbursement under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act) from philanthropic sources to cover operating
deficits attributable to the provision of discounted services. Philanthropic sources include private trusts,

for financial and other objective eligibility criteria and procedures, including notice prior to nonemergency
service, that assure effective opportunity for all persons to apply for and obtain a determination of eligibility
for such services including a determination prior to service where requested; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission's 1994 User Fee Update is adopted substantially as proposed in our notice of proposed rulemaking published
at 59 FR 29586 (June 8, 1994). However, due to recent Congressional action concerning tariff filings and the delay
in implementing optical imaging for tariff filings, Fee Item (74)(i) relating to the filing of tariffs, rates schedules,
and contract and/or contract summaries including supplements, is set at $13 rather that $15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, the description of Fee Item (85) involving valuation of railroad lines in conjunction with purchase offers
is being revised to clarify that the fee applies to offers to subsidize a rail line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission concludes that the fee changes adopted here will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities because the Commission's regulations provide for waiver of filing fees for those entities
which can make the required showing of financial hardship. In addition, the fee policy changes adopted here will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because those changes only involve minor
revisions of the Commission's user fee policy.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS rescinds the closure of the fishery for large coastal sharks conducted in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and
Caribbean Sea. Rescission of the closure of this fishery is necessary because new information indicates that the
second semiannual quota for large coastal sharks has not been taken. Based on revised estimates of landings and projected
catches, a new closure date is established.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Atlantic shark fishery is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP)
for Atlantic Sharks under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
.). Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR part 678.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 678.23(b)(3) of the regulations provides for two semiannual quotas of large coastal sharks to be harvested
in or from the Western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, by owners or operators
of vessels permitted under &sect;678.4. The adjusted second semiannual quota of 1,318 metric tons (mt) is available
for harvest from July 1 through December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), is required under &sect;678.24 to monitor the catch and landing
statistics and, on the basis of these statistics, to determine when the catch of sharks in or from the Western North
Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, will equal any quota under &sect;678.23(b). When
shark harvests reach, or are projected to reach, a quota established under &sect;678.23(b), the AA is further required
under &sect;678.24 to close the fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AA had determined, based on the best available data on reported catch and projections of future landings, that
the semiannual quota for large coastal sharks in or from the Western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico
and Caribbean Sea, for the period July 1 through December 31, 1994, would be attained by August 10, 1994. Therefore,
a closure notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 1, 1994 (59 FR 38943), to take effect August 10, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon further analysis of the landings data, including new information that became available since announcement
of the closure date, the AA has determined that 656.95 mt of the 1,318 mt quota for the large coastal shark fishery remain
unharvested. Therefore, the closure of August 10, 1994, is rescinded effective September 1, to allow an opportunity
for shark fishermen to take their full allocation. The effective date of rescission has been established at September
1, 1994, in response to industry's request for sufficient advance notice of the reopening of the large coastal shark
fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The daily landing rates obtained from the revised estimates indicate that the remaining quota in the large coastal
shark fishery could be harvested within 40 days. Therefore, it is projected that the available quota will be taken
by October 10, 1994, and for vessels issued a permit under &sect;678.4, possession of large coastal sharks from the
management unit will be prohibited as of 0001 hours on October 11, 1994. The AA is announcing this closure date in advance
in response to industry's request for sufficient advance notice of the closure of the large coastal shark fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the closure, for vessels issued a permit under &sect;678.4, possession of large coastal sharks from the management
unit is prohibited, unless the vessel is operating as a charter vessel or headboat, in which case the vessel limit per
trip is four large coastal sharks. However, the sale, purchase, trade, or barter or attempted sale, purchase, trade,
or barter of carcasses and/or fins of large coastal sharks harvested by a person aboard a vessel that has been issued
a permit under &sect;678.4 is prohibited, except for those that were harvested, off-loaded, and sold, traded, or
bartered prior to October 10, 1994, and were held in storage by a dealer or processor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 14 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437l) (``the Act''), as amended by section 119 of the
Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (the ``1987 Act'') and Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing
Act of 1990 (``NAHA''), established the Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP), which was designed to govern the modernization
needs of PHAs and IHAs that own and operate 250 or more public or Indian housing units. PHAs and IHAs that own and operate
fewer than 250 public or Indian housing units are governed by the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(The reader should note that, hereafter, for ease of discussion, the preamble to this final rule uses the terms ``public
housing'' to refer to both public and Indian housing, and ``HAs'' or ``housing agency,'' to refer to both PHAs and IHAs,
unless otherwise stated. In addition, the term ``development'' is used to refer to ``low-income projects,'' as defined
at section 3(b)(l) of the Act.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department promulgated regulations for the CGP and CIAP at 24 CFR parts 905 and 968, and these regulations have
governed the modernization of public and Indian housing assisted under the Act. On February 14, 1992, the Department
published the final rule for the CGP at 57 FR 5514. The February 14, 1992 rule amended the CIAP at 24 CFR part 968, subpart
B, to limit its applicability to HAs that own or operate fewer than 500 public housing units (fewer than 250 units beginning
in Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 1993); added a new subpart C to part 968, which sets forth the new CGP for HAs that own or operate
a total of 500 or more public housing units (250 or more units beginning in FFY 1993); and revised both the CIAP and CGP
programs for purposes of implementing various technical and substantive program amendments contained in sections
509 (b) through (f) of the NAHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 15, 1993, the Department published an interim rule for CIAP at 58 FR 13916 for HAs with less than 250 units in
FFY 1993 and minor technical corrections for CGP. The CIAP interim rule was published in response to public comment
requesting both streamlining and simplification and was also based on experience gained through program operation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 8, 1994, the Department published a proposed CGP rule for comment at 59 FR 10876 (hereinafter referred to as
the ``proposed rule''). The proposed rule requested comments on HUD's efforts to simplify and expedite the CGP planning
and funding process for HAs that own or operate 250 or more public or Indian housing units. HUD also requested comments
on other aspects affecting the operation of the CGP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Summary of Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD received 35 comments in response to the proposed rule for CGP. Comments were received from 23 PHAs, 5 IHAs, one individual
and 6 interest groups including Public Housing Authorities Directors Association (PHADA), National Association
of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO), Council of Large Public Housing Authorities (CLPHA), National
American Indian Housing Council (NAIHC), Association of Community Organization for Reform Now (ACORN), and Pacific
Southwest Region Development and Modernization Coordinators (PSRDMC). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments were overwhelmingly positive and were supportive of HUD's efforts to simplify and expedite the CGP.
Commenters were pleased that HUD had minimized the regulation and provided HAs with more flexibility. The aspects
of this rule which generated the most comment were the proposed full fungibility of work items over a five-year period
and eligible costs, especially management improvements and administrative costs. This summary will outline the
comments with HUD's response in the regulation order. Comments on the public housing regulation (Part 968) and Indian
housing regulation (Part 905) have been combined except where there are differences in the provisions for public
and Indian housing. Miscellaneous comments and responses will follow the comments on the regulations.

Set-Aside for Emergencies and Disasters

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters responded to the proposed change in paragraph (b) of &sect;&sect;905.601 and 968.103 which would
allow all HAs (including smaller HAs that participate in CIAP) to apply for emergency and disaster funds from the $75
million set-aside. Both commenters were supportive of this change which provides another avenue for smaller agencies
to access urgently needed resources; however, one of the commenters did not support the maintenance of the set-aside
out of modernization funds and suggested other fund sources such as National Emergency Relief funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 14 of the Act authorizes this set-aside from modernization funds. The set-aside is part of the formula approach
and makes up for funding shortfalls to address emergencies or disasters. This provision would also allow CIAP HAs
to receive funding for unanticipated emergencies during the period between when CIAP funds are exhausted for the
current year and when funds are available for next year, as well as for disasters at any time during the year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements governing the reserve for disasters and emergencies and the procedures by which an HA may request
such funds are found at &sect;&sect;905.667 (IHAs) and 968.312 (PHAs). HAs (including a PHA that has been designated
as mod troubled under PHMAP or IHAs that are determined to be high risk under &sect;905.135) may obtain funds at any
time, for any eligible emergency work item as defined in &sect;&sect;905.102 or 968.305 (for HAs participating in
CGP, ``CGP HAs'') or for any eligible emergency work item (described as emergency modernization in &sect;&sect;905.102
or 968.205) (for HAs participating in CIAP, ``CIAP HAs''), from the reserve established under &sect;&sect;905.601(b)
or 968.103(b). However, emergency reserve funds may not be provided to a CGP HA that has the necessary funds available
from any other source, including its annual formula allocation under &sect;&sect;905.601 (e) and (f) or 968.103
(e) and (f), other unobligated modernization funds, and its replacement reserves under &sect;&sect;905.666 or
968.310(a)(3). A CGP HA is not required to have an approved comprehensive plan under &sect;&sect;905.672 or 968.320
before it can request emergency assistance from this reserve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emergency reserve funds may not be provided to a CIAP HA that has the necessary funds available from any other source,
including unobligated CIAP, or if CIAP funding is available. A CIAP HA will not be required to repay emergency funds,
because it does not have a future formula allocation of assistance with which to make this repayment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To date, the set-aside has never been depleted in any of the FFYs of CGP operation. This final rule adopts the proposed
rule's provisions. However, the Department is seeking legislation which will permit the set-aside to be used for
other purposes including activities related to the settlement of litigation and desegregation of public housing.

 HUD has retained the proposed rule's provisions on calculation of number of units. In order to treat each HA fairly,
HUD will count units that have reached date of full availability (DOFA) and are under ACC amendment by the first day
in the FFY in which the formula is being run.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All of the IHAs which commented provided suggestions on the treatment of paid-off units. Two commenters were in favor
of modernizing paid-off units only if additional funds are made available (paid-off units being included in the calculation
of units under management for formula funding allocation purposes).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Units which are paid-off, but not conveyed, are included in the calculation of units under management and for purposes
of determining the IHA's formula share until they are conveyed. Upon conveyance, units are removed from the count
of units under management and thereafter are no longer counted in the formula funding calculation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An IHA wanted to be able to work on homes that have been paid-off if the family that paid-off the home is still in possession
of the home, or to work on any home that pays off after submission of the five-year plan, and recommended that paid-off
units should be added to the unit count. One IHA suggested grandfathering all units that were originally submitted
in the five-year plan but have subsequently been paid-off. Another IHA indicated that some Mutual Help participants
are being penalized by the cut-off date, and IHAs should be allowed to work on their homes even if they are paid-off when
the individual has fulfilled all of their obligations by not being delinquent (or who makes the maximum house payments)
and still occupies the home.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has decided to remove the regulatory prohibition against modernizing Mutual Help units which are
paid-off but not conveyed. The Department believes that the only regulatory restrictions on the modernization of
paid-off Mutual Help units should be that: title has not been conveyed to the homebuyer; where the homebuyer has a delinquency
at the end of the amortization period, non-emergency modernization work shall not be done until all delinquencies
are repaid; and, the units shall be identified in the Comprehensive Plan (including the Physical Needs Assessments
and Five-Year Action Plan). The prohibition against performing modernization work on conveyed units is based on
a determination by the Department's Office of General Counsel that statutory authority for the expenditure of modernization
funds is limited to existing public housing units. Once title is conveyed and the unit is no longer covered by the ACC,
the unit is no longer a public housing unit and there is no legal authority for the expenditure of modernization funds
provided under section 14 of the Act. IHAs that wish to modernize conveyed Mutual Help units must obtain funding from
another source; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 proceeds from the sale of homeownership units or Bureau of Indian Affairs Housing Improvement Program funds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the recommendations provided by the commenters concerning whether the unit must be occupied by the
homebuyer that paid it off, the Department believes that prior to conveyance, the unit would be occupied by an eligible
subsequent homebuyer and therefore the unit itself would be eligible for modernization work, where needed. The Department
believes that decisions as to whether the IHA plans to modernize paid-off but not conveyed Mutual Help units at all,
which specific units will be modernized and the level of work to be provided, should be made at the local level by the
IHA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also has removed restrictions on the modernization of paid-off but not conveyed Turnkey III units
to the extent that there is statutory authority to do so. The authority to perform comprehensive modernization on
Mutual Help units provided by the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 does not extend to Turnkey III units. Because
the eligibility of homeowner-occupied Turnkey III units for modernization work is limited, see &sect;905.666 and
&sect;968.310, the regulations have been amended to allow HAs to do work necessary to meet statutory or regulatory
requirements in Turnkey III units which are paid-off, so long as the work is completed prior to conveyance.

Contingency Accounts

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although not proposed by HUD, three commenters recommended an HA-wide line-item account for contingencies. Such
an account could be used for cost overruns and contract modifications (change orders). The commenters called for
money assigned to this account by the HA to be considered ``obligated''. One PHA has found that its underruns on construction
contracts are sufficient to fund most exigencies and act as a de facto contingency account. However, HUD restricts
the use of underruns by requiring that all monies be reprogrammed within the funding program's original obligation
period. It was noted that a contingency line item exists for development funds, and the amount in the contingency line
item could be limited to a fixed percentage of the construction costs and would not require HAs to make numerous revisions
to their budgets. A single revision could be made annually with the contract modifications reflected in the proper
line item.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD generally agrees with these comments and has revised the regulation to permit HAs to budget for a contingency account
for cost overruns and contract modifications. HUD notes that Section 504 accessibility conversion is an eligible
expense under HA-wide physical improvements. Refer to the next section below for a discussion of HA-wide items.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD currently permits a contingency account in its Development Program and has decided to adopt a similar approach
for the CGP. A HA may budget up to 8% of its total annual grant for a contingency account. (A new account will be established
and included on the Annual Statement Form). Money budgeted in a contingency account is considered unobligated until
it is moved to another account and obligated for a cost overrun or other work items. The HA will provide the status of
its contingency account in its annual Performance and Evaluation Report (P&amp;E Report). For example, if an HA uses
$100,000 from its contingency fund for a contract modification in Account 1460, the P&amp;E Report will reflect a
reduction of $100,000 in the contingency account and an increase of $100,000 in Account 1460. The $100,000 will be
obligated when the contract modification is issued under Account 1460. The contingency account will be a fixed account
for each annual grant; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the HA cannot replenish the account as funds are used from it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD wishes to clarify that it does not restrict the use of underruns by requiring that all monies be reprogrammed within
the funding program's original obligation period. Under the CGP, a HA may extend the target dates for fund obligation
in the approved Annual Statement without prior HUD approval whenever any delay outside of the HA's control occurs,
as specified by HUD (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 litigation, HUD or other institutional delay, extended labor strikes, extended material shortages, or need to use
leftover funds) and the extension is made in a timely manner. The need to reprogram unobligated funds resulting from
underruns constitutes a valid reason for self-executing a time extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One HA suggested a two pronged approach for implementing contingency accounts. First, HUD should remove the two-year
obligation deadline and allow HAs to obligate monies at any time in the modernization process provided that the funds
are expended within the 5-year statutory limit. The second component would permit each HA to establish a line-item
contingency account equal to 1%&hyph;2% of the total grant amount in its annual submission. Funds resulting from
underruns or credit contract modifications would be transferred into the contingency account for future use. The
account would not be allowed to exceed 10% of the outstanding grant balance without prior HUD approval. HAs would draw
funds to pay for contingencies from the account as needed. These funds would be added to contract accounts via budget
modifications. In general, excess contingency account funds would be reprogrammed into additional modernization
work. This modernization work could come from anywhere in the HA's physical or management needs assessment or from
eligible management improvements. As the expenditure deadline for a particular funding year nears, HAs would begin
to use the excess funds in that year's contingency account to pay for contract work performed in other funding programs.
At the end of the fifth year, all program funds_including contingency account funds_would be expended. HAs would
prepare for HUD's review and audit, annual reports detailing the use of all contingency funds. In addition, program
close-out reports would provide HUD with a detailed accounting for each contract on which program funds were spent.
An amendment to &sect;&sect;905.666 and 968.310 was also recommended to describe the mechanics for operating a contingency
account.

 HUD wishes to clarify that there is no statutory two-year obligation period, three-year expenditure period, or 5-year
statutory limit for spending funds approved in a particular FFY. However, HUD expects that funds allocated in a FFY,
including those designated by the HA as contingency funds, will be obligated within two years and expended within
three years of approval. If an HA can demonstrate that a longer implementation schedule is necessary (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 size of grant, complexity of work), HUD may approve an obligation/expenditure schedule that exceeds this National
guideline. The HA has responsibility for proposing its implementation schedule, as part of each Annual Work Statement.
Also, as previously noted, the HA may self-execute a time extension of the approved implementation schedule for reasons
outside of its control (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 litigation). In all cases, however, timeliness of obligation and expenditure of funds will be considered in the assessment
of a PHA's modernization performance under the PHMAP.

The HA may initially budget up to 8% of its annual grant for contingencies, and HUD believes that this provides sufficient
flexibility for HAs within each annual grant. When the HA needs to use the funds in this contingency account for cost
overruns or other work within its Five-Year Action Plan, the HA is required to ``move the funds'' through internal
budgeting to other eligible development accounts and then draw down the funds from other line items. After the HA has
moved the funds from the contingency account into other eligible development accounts for purposes of obligation
and expenditure, the HA may not replenish this account because at program completion, this account must be zero. Therefore,
HUD has not adopted the suggestion that funds resulting from underruns or contract modifications be used to replenish
this account since funds in the contingency account must be moved to other line items for drawdown in a timely fashion
to meet the HA's approved implementation schedule. Funds resulting from underruns or credit contract modifications,
as well as funds not needed for contingencies shall be reprogrammed for other modernization work in the approved Five-Year
Action Plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters recommended a HA-wide line item account for relocation services, asbestos testing and abatement,
lead-based paint abatement and ``on demand'' Section 504 accessibility conversions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD recognizes that HAs occasionally encounter work items that are unpredictable, such as lead-based paint abatement
when a child has been identified as having an elevated blood level or the need to modify a unit for physical accessibility.
Therefore, HUD wishes to clarify that HA-wide line item accounts covering HA-wide activities such as lead-based
paint, Section 504 compliance, mitigation of environmental hazards such as asbestos abatement, and modernization
of vacant units is consistent with established program requirements and procedures and does not require any change
to the existing regulation. Note: modernization of vacant units is limited to non-routine maintenance work items.
Routine maintenance is not an eligible modernization cost. Funds budgeted in a HA-wide line item should be based on
historical data. The HA should estimate the amount of funds that it anticipates will be needed, annually, on the above
items. The HA-wide line item would enable the HA to complete these work items at any of its developments, and avoid numerous
budget revisions because the estimated needs at a particular development are under-funded or over-funded. However,
the HA is required to report in the Performance and Evaluation Report on the quantity and cost for each development
where HA-wide activities were carried out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to HA-wide line items, a HA may wish to consider utilizing an indefinite quantity architectural/engineering
(A/E) contract to meet its needs with regard to the above types of work. HAs usually hire A/E firms to provide services
as specific needs arise. Many HAs, however, have the need for a number of A/E services during the course of the next one
or two years. In these cases, the HA may solicit for an indefinite quantity contract where separate orders are issued
to the selected A/E firm for each service as the need arises. Another method similar to this approach is to issue a solicitation
for several A/E firms to provide services on an as-required basis rather than merely one firm. The solicitation would
clearly indicate that the HA anticipates having the need for several A/E services, identify types of services to be
provided for that year, and describe how an A/E firm would be selected among the groups. As the need arises, the HA would
execute contracts with A/E firms for specific tasks in accordance with the procedures identified in the solicitation.
These methods allow the HA to quickly contract for critical services in a timely manner rather than waiting until the
need arises to issue the solicitation and select the needed firm. Further information regarding indefinite quantity
contracts for A/E services is found in paragraph 4&hyph;26 of the Procurement Handbook.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Twenty-eight comments were received on the proposal to raise the cap on management improvements from 10% to 20% and
to permit high performers under PHMAP or IHAs determined by the Field Office to be high performing and with administrative
capacity to exceed the 20% limit. To the maximum extent feasible, the Department proposed that HAs should use management
improvement funds to train residents in carrying out activities related to the modernization-funded physical and
management improvements. Most commenters saw the proposal as a significant improvement. Some noted that this proposal
will not relieve HUD of its responsibility to adequately fund mandates regarding resident services (security improvements,
training, etc.) and operating subsidies. Others opposed the Department for even suggesting that modernization
improvement funds be utilized for resident training activities and preferred that this be left to local discretion.
Many commenters urged a return to ``true'' management improvement activities, rather than recent years' necessity
of funding on-going operational need in HAs in areas of security, drug prevention and enforcement and resident services.
It was recommended that CGP funds should only be used for incremental improvement to equipment and information systems,
but not personnel. It was noted that each HA's modernization grant is based upon a formula allocation, which is based
upon that HA's estimated modernization needs. There is nothing in this method of allocation which reflects or is based
upon a HA's needs for funding for security, resident services, or resident initiatives programs, nor is the formula
allocation process designed to address those needs. Other commenters saw the percentage limitation increase enabling
some HAs to address new and greater problems dealing with crime and security as well as family values. One commenter
supported the proposal because it could result in needed funds for resident training required for compliance with
Section 3 and other programs such as the Family Investment Center Program and Youthbuild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommended that HUD should also broaden the list of allowable management improvements, especially
to include the establishment of preventive maintenance systems as an eligible item under management improvements,
perhaps up to a certain reasonable percentage limit (one recommended 6% of most HA's CGP grants). CLPHA and NAHRO strongly
recommended that management improvement rules allow preventive maintenance to be funded. They recommended where
a low AEL has resulted in seriously declining housing stock with high levels of deferred maintenance, the first few
years of implementing a Preventive Maintenance Program represent a major non-recurring expense in terms of both
manpower and materials. After the first three years, the cost associated with this program was proposed by some commenters
to be reduced to a level that is supportable within the normal operating budget.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD would like to clarify by explicitly adding the example to the regulation that the establishment of a preventive
maintenance system or improvement of an existing system is already an eligible management improvement. The Department
strongly encourages HAs to establish a preventive maintenance system or improve an existing system to assure that
the modernization-funded physical improvements are sustained. A preventive maintenance system must provide for
regular inspections of building structures, systems and units and determine the applicability of work eligible
for operating funds (routine maintenance) and work eligible for CGP funding (non-routine maintenance).

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters opposed the increase to 20% because of their belief that the majority of modernization funds should
go to property improvement. They asserted that the CGP was becoming another HUD social program and stated there were
wastes in the area of management improvements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters requested that the Department reconsider and give the proposed incentive to all standard and high
performing HAs. It was also recommended that subparagraph (f)(1)(iii) should clarify that there is an exception
to the 20% threshold by a cross-reference to (m)(1). Clarification was requested whether a HA must be an over-all high
performer, mod-high performer, both or either.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to the comments, HUD has decided to increase the cap on management improvements from 10% to 20% for all HAs
and to completely remove the cap for PHAs designated as both over-all high performers and mod-high performers under
the PHMAP. HUD does not agree that increasing the allowable management improvement limit moves the CGP towards becoming
another ``HUD social program''. Many management improvements are geared towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness
of a HA's operations and are necessary to sustain the physical improvements. It should be noted that the direct delivery
of social services is an ineligible CGP expenditure. Experience has shown that physical improvements without appropriate
management actions often are not sustained, thereby wasting federal dollars. HUD will continue to strongly suggest
that HAs use management improvement funds for resident training and has retained this suggestion in &sect;968.310(m)(1).

 One IHA commented that there is no equality as to how ACA reviews are conducted at the HUD level since some reviews are
not conducted on site, leading to determinations which may not be accurate. Two IHAs suggested that the criteria for
IHA high performers should be stringent enough that only the best managed IHAs be classified as high performers, and
that all areas of IHA management and operations should be evaluated. They suggested the following criteria: (a) The
IHA must have a final ACA score of 90% or above for two consecutive years, including the FFY that funds are being requested,
and (b) the IHA must be current on all implementation schedules for action CGP and CIAP grants. Two commenters suggested
that HUD consult with interested parties to set guidelines for high performers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD does not agree with the suggestions that ACA scores be used to determine whether an IHA qualifies as a high performer.
The ACA is to be used to highlight areas where training or technical assistance may be needed, identify IHAs with potential
problems, and determine functional areas where reviews are needed. HUD has decided to delay implementation of the
incentive for high performing IHAs in order to maximize the opportunity for consultation with interested parties.
HUD will invite public comment on the criteria to be used to determine high performers when the revised Indian Housing
regulations at 24 CFR part 905 are published as a proposed rule.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD limited HAs to no more than 7% of their annual grant for administrative costs in account 1410, excluding any costs
related to in-house lead-based paint or asbestos testing, in-house A/E work, or other special administrative costs
required by State, Tribal or local law, unless specifically approved by HUD. An additional 2% of the annual grant may
be spent on costs related to travelling to the HA's developments for CGP-related business, as specifically approved
by HUD. Eighteen comments were received on this provision. Most of the comments urged HUD to raise the cap to 10%. Most
found the current 7% to be insufficient to fully administer the modernization program. For example, one commenter
indicated that in a high cost area, the expenses for a construction manager and clerk of the works, with benefits, exceed
the 7% cap. HUD was advised that even HAs which operate in a limited geographical area often require overnight travel
and pay a premium for administration because of the need to operate over several telephone area codes. HAs which have
highly active, very organized Resident Advisory Councils and Resident Management Corporations have higher administrative
costs because of increased level of outreach, planning, consultations and discussions. Similarly, HAs that operate
joint ventures with residents also experience increase administrative costs. Others noted that the present 7% cap
does not reflect the spiraling increase in health benefits, workers compensation, and unemployment insurance premiums
for administrative workers, increase in complexity and resulting staff time to comply with HUD's regulations, and
increase in expenses associated with transitioning from the CIAP model to CGP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters recommended that the word ``in-house'' be deleted, and that any costs related to lead-based paint or asbestos
testing be excluded from the 7% total. Another commenter emphasized the administrative burden that lead-based paint
and asbestos abatement imposes on HAs. Nearly every rehabilitation and remodeling activity in public housing developments
now requires the work of environmental consultants for lead-based paint and/or asbestos testing and abatement.
The oversight and administration of these contracts is very time- and resource-intensive. Some commenters requested
examples of areas where the Field Offices could approve higher limits. HUD was asked to clarify the issue of administration
of force-account labor. It was requested that the regulation state that administrative costs associated with force
account labor used in relationship to resident training programs are eligible management improvement costs. NAIHC
noted that IHAs with force account labor incur additional administrative costs because they need more warehouse
space to house their materials, more administrative staff to process the paperwork, and more financial management
staff to assure records are up-to-date. In addition, development staff spends more time overseeing the entire program.
They recommended that the administrative cost limit be set at 10%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that like management improvements, standard and high performing HAs be allowed to exceed
the 7% level without prior HUD approval. Retaining the additional 2% for CGP travel-related expenses received approval,
but it was recommended that it should not be limited to commercial vendors because some legitimate overnight travel
may be conducted by private or PHA-owned automobiles. Some commenters suggested that the additional 2% should include
some factor related to miles traveled in relationship to density of developments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The comments clearly demonstrate a need for an increase in the administrative cost limit. Accordingly, HUD has raised
the administrative cost limit to 10% for all HAs. Field Offices may approve amounts higher than the 10% limit where
there is sufficient justification to warrant an increase. Because of the increase in the overall administrative
cost limit, HUD has deleted the additional 2% limit related to travel costs. It should be noted that costs related to
lead-based paint or asbestos testing (whether conducted by force account employees or by a contractor) are excluded
from the 10% administrative cost total. In response to the request for clarification on the issue of administration
of force-account labor, it should be noted that non-technical oversight costs associated with force account work
are included in the cost limitations for administrative costs (account 1410). The actual force account labor costs
including direct supervision are charged to the appropriate account for the work being performed,

 Recently, the Public Housing Development Program, revised its cost containment and modest design requirements
to provide HAs with maximum flexibility regarding work items previously considered amenities. Maximum flexibility
is hereby being provided in the CGP. The Department has modified its policy regarding eligible work items under CGP
to allow work items that are modest in design and cost, but still blend in with the design and architecture of the surrounding
communities by including amenities, quality materials and design and landscaping features that are customary for
the locality. The Indian Housing Development Program also encourages IHAs to incorporate culturally relevant design
concepts into their developments. For guidance in culturally relevant design considerations, IHAs may refer to

It should be noted that there will be no increase in operating subsidy due to items added to promote the blend of public
housing into the surrounding neighborhood. Such items may be included in the modernization of a development as long
as the provisions for cost reasonableness are met. The PHA/IHA Board Resolution approving the Comprehensive Plan/Annual
Statement, Form HUD&hyph;52836, will be modified to include a certification that the modernization work will promote
Public and Indian housing that is modest in design and cost, but still blends in with the surrounding community.

 Purchase of maintenance vehicles that are necessary to administer/implement the modernization program are eligible

Program and other programs administered by the HA, the cost of the purchase shall be prorated among programs. By statute,
CGP funds are to be used to improve the physical condition of existing public housing projects and to upgrade the management
and operation of such projects. All work items, including the purchase of equipment, must be directly related to carrying
out the physical and management improvements to HA property.

 Most found that the previous system caused unnecessary confusion and created HA credibility issues with residents
and local government. They agreed with HUD's proposal to eliminate the presumptive estimates since, in general,
they no longer serve a useful purpose. This change eliminates the burden of amending the Five-Year Action Plan and/or

 HAs expressed a need to receive their final formula amounts at the earliest possible date. This would allow HAs to base
proposed work items and budgets on the actual dollars available. Commenters also requested HUD to update the formula
characteristics data in July and August of each year so that the formula characteristics information can be finalized
in September. If the formula characteristics information was ready in September, it could be applied at the earliest
possible date to the congressionally appropriated amount yielding each HA its final funding amount significantly
ahead of the March 1994 date achieved this year. Access to new CGP funds at the earliest possible date is critical to
obligating and expending CGP funds in a timely manner.

Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD will transmit the formula characteristics data to HAs before the end of the current FFY for review and updating
for the next year's formula run. However, since the formula calculation is based on all units that are under ACC and
have reached DOFA by October 1 of the FFY in which the formula is being run, it is not feasible for HAs to return the FCR
until after October 1. Notwithstanding an early review and correction of data, HAs should be aware that the exact amount
of funds available for the CGP may not be known until several months into the FFY. This is due to the need to determine
the following: (1) Amount of funds, if any, carried over from the previous FFY; (2) amount of funds authorized for set-asides
by the Appropriations Act; and (3) shortfalls, if any, in other programs which share the Annual Contributions Account
with the Modernization Program. Once the adjusted total appropriation for the Modernization Program is determined,
then the Department is able to run the modernization formula, which determines the allocation of funds between the
CIAP and CGP, as well as the formula amounts for CGP HAs. However, HUD still anticipates that HAs will have access to
their formula amounts earlier in the FFY since only one formula amount will be provided.

by HUD to determine if they have a valid basis for appeal. Currently, HUD issues virtually no information on how the
amounts are calculated from year to year, other than the formula characteristics which HUD uses as input to the formula.
Commenters requested that HUD provide a simplified explanation to all HAs, including such factors as any set-asides
HUD is making each year off the top of the modernization, the R.S. Means or other factors HUD is using to adjust local
allocation levels, and any deductions HUD is making against the HA's allocation.

 HUD intends to prepare a Notice each FFY that explains any modernization set-asides, deductions and carry-over funds
and the amount of funds allocated to the CIAP and the CGP. HUD will also provide information relative to the R.S. Means
Index used for that FFY. The formula characteristics data used to calculate the formula amount will be transmitted
to the HA with its formula amount.

 HUD gives HAs 30 days to review and advise HUD of errors in the FCR. It does not specify the calculation of the 30 days.
It is recommended that the regulation be redrafted to state ``30 days from the HA's receipt to review and advise HUD
of errors'' because of previous delays (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., up to 15 days before HAs received this year's report). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the appeal of a HA's annual formula allocation can only be based on unique circumstances. HAs suggest that
this is inappropriate and should be changed, but they realized that this would require a statutory amendment. HAs
want to be able to appeal their allocation if it is based on calculations that inaccurately represent a HA's real modernization
needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was also noted that the increase in the amount of time a HA has to appeal based upon error from 30 to 60 days equalizes
the HUD&hyph;HA partnership for appeals based both on error and unique circumstances. However, if HAs do not file
within the time period, they forfeit their appeal rights. In the spirit of true partnership, it was suggested that
if HUD fails to respond to an appeal in either situation within 60 days, HUD should forfeit its right to reject the appeal.
Further, they stated that this would only be effective and fair if HUD officials do not automatically disapprove an
appeal in order to extend the time period.

 HUD acknowledges past difficulty in ensuring that HAs had a full 30 days to review and return the FCR. It would be difficult
to track a HA's receipt of the FCR on an individual basis, and there is a need for a fixed time for HAs to respond. Because
the data changes little on an annual basis, HA review time should be minimal. As previously noted, HUD will send out
the FCR prior to the end of the FFY, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
mid-August), and HA responses will not be due until after October 1. In addition, HUD has revised the regulation to
provide that the HA will have at least 30 days to review and correct errors in the FCR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the commenters recognized that a statutory amendment would be necessary to allow other bases for appeals
of the annual formula allocation, HUD would like to point out that the formula is based on data collected from a major
study of the modernization needs of public and Indian housing agencies. This formula is being used because the modernization
needs study could not provide statistically valid data on modernization needs for every HA. The formula by its nature
cannot be completely accurate in estimating the needs at each HA participating in the CGP, but does provide for a reliable
source of funds to all participating HAs. HAs should also recognize that, because this formula funds on the basis of
relative needs of HAs, a successful appeal by one HA results in the reduction of formula allocations to all other HAs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAs are also advised that the appeals no longer have an extra layer of HUD review. The review and approval of appeals
on the basis of error in data and of the reduced formula because a PHA is mod-troubled have been delegated to the Field
Offices, and this should facilitate HUD's responding to those appeals within the 60-day time frame. The approval
of appeals on the basis of unique circumstances will be approved at the Headquarter's level following review at the
Field Office level. The review at the Regional Office level has been eliminated. Therefore, HUD has not adopted the
suggestion that an appeal is considered approved if HUD does not approve/disapprove within 60 days.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter noted that HUD should be more aggressive in recapturing CGP and CIAP funding which has not been obligated
or expended in a timely manner and should also be more aggressive about reallocating CGP funding withheld from mod-troubled
HAs. It was urged that these funds should be reallocated in a timely fashion to HAs who have proven that they can obligate
and expend the funds in a timely fashion. Commenters were concerned that FFY 1995 CGP funding would be reduced for all
HAs because of the amount of unobligated and unexpended funds. Instead, they suggested that HUD add recaptured and
reallocated funds to new congressional appropriations to put the money where it will get utilized. HAs indicated
that it was unfair to penalize high performing HAs because some HAs have been negligent in obligating and expending
their funds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The commenter should note that section 14 of the Act, as amended, provides the methodology and eligibility for the
reallocation of funds. The Act also establishes a credit system to provide a HA with additional funding after the HA
is determined to be no longer mod-troubled, to compensate for amounts not received because of the mod-troubled designation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department views the recapture of funds from a HA as a last resort since recapture adversely impacts on the residents
who have to continue to live in housing which needs rehabilitation. HUD staff is directed to exhaust all other means
of technical assistance, including requiring alternative oversight by a third party, to help HAs obligate and expend
funds. However, where such assistance does not work, HUD will recapture funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the concern regarding possible reduction in CGP funding, HUD has amended its FY 1995 budget request
to increase by $100 million funding for modernization up to $2.9 billion.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Most commenters agreed with the concept of fungibility of work items to promote expenditure of oldest funds first
and recommended various ways that HUD could further speed up the process. First, to speed the flow of funds in the modernization
pipeline, HUD should substantially speed up HUD's own release of the modernization funds each year. The commenters
believed that most HAs do not get a funding reservation until late summer each year. HUD should be able to make each year's
new funding under CGP available to the HAs by no later than March 1. Commenters disagreed that the two-year obligation
period should begin with the ACC amendment. HAs stated that it can take up to 15 months to receive the ACC amendment.
HUD was asked to improve its performance in this area or continue to allow a five-year period. Allowing a five-year
period would give HAs maximum flexibility in scheduling modernization work. It was suggested that HUD's role should
be limited to monitoring PHA progress through the P&amp;E Report.

 HUD disagrees that it will take up to 15 months for HAs to have an executed ACC amendment and receive funds. HUD has streamlined
the ACC amendment process. As noted in Notice PIH 94&hyph;13 (entitled Expediting Obligation/Expenditure of Modernization
Funds in the Pipeline, issued April 6, 1994), the ACC amendment is prepared by Field Office program staff, reviewed
by the HUD Field Counsel and forwarded to the HA for signature. Unless required by State or local law or the HA by-laws,
the Executive Director is permitted to sign and return the ACC amendment without a Board Resolution. HAs are encouraged
to consider amending their by-laws (where permitted under law) so that a Board Resolution is not required or, if a Board
Meeting is not imminent, the HA may consider conducting a telephone Board Meeting to authorize the signing of the ACC
amendment. After ACC amendment, the Field Office should spread the budget line items in the Line of Credit Control
System/Voice Response System (LOCCS/VRS) as quickly as possible. As to the need to speed up the provision of funds
to HAs, HUD has made significant progress in this regard, and in fact, advised HAs of their funding amount in February
of this year. It is anticipated that additional progress will be made and access to funds will occur even earlier in
the FFY since HUD will provide only one formula amount and the Formula Characteristics Report for the next FFY will
be sent out for review and validation prior to the end of the current FFY. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD must again emphasize that there is no mandatory two-year obligation period, three-year expenditure period,
or 5-year statutory limit for spending funds approved in a particular FFY. Generally, HUD expects that funds allocated
in a FFY will be obligated within two years and expended within three years of approval unless a longer implementation
schedule is approved by HUD. The HA has responsibility for establishing its implementation schedule, as part of its
Annual Statement. In instances where it is unreasonable for a HA to meet the two year-three year expectation for obligation
and expenditure of funds, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., size of grant, complexity of the work, the HA may propose a schedule of longer duration. Also, as previously noted,
the HA may self-execute a time extension of the approved implementation schedule for reasons outside of its control.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD plans to speed up release of modernization funds to the extent possible. However, HUD disagrees that this affects
the modernization pipeline and suggests that addressing the pipeline is a reprogramming issue. For additional guidance
on the issue of reprogramming, see Notice PIH 94&hyph;13.

 Another area commented on as causing delay in the obligation of formula funding is the LOCCS/VRS automated draw-down
mechanism. Problems include systemic problems such as having to draw equal monthly amounts as well as persistent
problems with errors by Field Office staff in placing edits on accounts and not removing them in a timely fashion. Reports
were received indicating that some Field Office staff do not agree with the expedited policies and deliberately delay
the process.

 It was recommended that the obligation requirements should be made consistent with the annual submission section
which allows a HA to self-execute an extension when delays are out of its control. HUD was cautioned that while on the
surface accelerating the program's implementation schedule for obligating and expending funds would suggest a
quicker utilization of these dollars, such an acceleration without a transition period or a recognition of the needs
of larger HAs would likely result in either schedules not being met or those dollars being poorly utilized. They noted
that HAs are still shifting their modernization operations from one based on the CIAP to one based on CGP. HUD was urged
to review and alter other regulatory standards or work practices as the mechanism for accelerating the usage of Federal
modernization dollars.

 HUD again notes that the obligation time-frame is a general rule. If a HA can demonstrate that a longer obligation timeframe
is warranted, HUD may initially approve a time period longer than two years, and subsequently, a HA may extend the approved
implementation schedule if there are reasons outside of its control, as long as the extension is made in a timely manner.

 One HA noted that HUD's proposal was reasonable except for FFY 92 and FFY 93. In those years their plans included making
504 accessibility improvements, assessment and removal of lead-based paint, and capital improvements required
as the result of deferred maintenance and inadequate previous years funding under their operating budget and CIAP.
It was recommended that the changes under proposed rule for obligating funds not be retroactive to FFYs 92&hyph;94.

 This obligation guideline will now appear in the regulation and continues to be a guideline. Approved implementation

 HUD disagrees that a longer period is needed for larger HAs. HUD recognizes the concerns of the New York City Housing
Authority (NYCHA) and other HAs with over 10,000 units. HUD wants to point out that section 14 of the Act does not differentiate
between the types of submissions to be made by HAs participating in the CGP due to their size. Nevertheless, HUD believes
that the NYCHA and other large HAs will be benefitted, along with all other HAs participating in the CGP, as a result
of the simplified requirements contained in this final rule.

 CLPHA mentioned in its comments that HAs on the average nationwide now spend 80% of their modernization funds within
3.25 years from the time they receive their ACC amendment. In a large proportion of cases, the remaining 20% of the funds
are held up for a variety of reasons beyond the control of the HA (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 unsatisfactory performance by contractors, litigation, unforeseen problems with lead-based paint, asbestos,
other hazardous materials or site problems). CLPHA recommended that PHA's PHMAP scores be based on the time it take
them to obligate or expend 80% of their modernization money, since this is much more within the control of the PHA. Another
commenter objected to the all or nothing bases of PHMAP. Although no suggestions were made, the PHA suggested as an
overall recommendation that a PHA's performance be based on whether they have accomplished the scope of work stated
in their work plan as opposed to whether they have residuals resulting from this plan.

 HUD has referred these comments to the PHMAP working group for consideration in the development of a revised PHMAP

of work, HUD may approve a schedule that exceeds the National guideline. PHMAP is based on whether they are performing
under the HUD-approved or extended schedule.

 While commmenters appreciated the mechanism of a prior corrective action order with appeal rights that the proposed

of this penalty, the agency must have been declared mod-troubled for at least one year; (b) The mod-troubled authority
must be failing to meet the objectives set forth in its Memorandum of Agreement; and (c) At least six months prior to
imposing the penalty, a team consisting of HUD personnel and better performing CGP agencies should be sent to the affected
authority to try to assist the agency in getting its program in order. Some commenters agreed that a HUD alternative
management strategy may be imposed as long as the HA is given a voice in the strategy.

 The comments present a rather rigid structure. HUD prefers to work with the HAs on a case-by-case basis and tailor its
technical assistance to HAs based on their specific needs before requiring an alternative strategy. HUD would only
require alternative management by a third party after a corrective action order had been issued and the HA failed to
comply with the order. Examples of technical assistance that may be provided include but are not limited to:

 It was proposed that HUD shall notify HAs of the requested date for submitting or updating a Comprehensive Plan. For
planning purposes, HAs may use the amount they received under CGP in the prior year in developing their Comprehensive
Plan or they may wait for the annual HUD notification of formula amount. One commenter conditionally supported this
proposal, and explained that without the formula amount, forms cannot be completely or accurately filled out. If
there is a major change in the formula amount, the planning and meetings with residents, staff, architects, governmental
agencies would have to be repeated. While the proposal may help, it was noted that it has the potential to also do a lot
of harm by creating more work and putting a HA into a very awkward and damaging position with staff, residents and local
agencies. IHA commenters were in favor of these changes. One commenter objected to the removal of the 30-day notice
for resident groups upon HUD's indication of the estimated funding level.

 A HA has the option to prepare its Comprehensive Plan/Annual Statement based on funding received in the prior year
and make adjustments before submission to HUD if the same amount of funding is not provided in the current year or the
HA can wait for the actual formula amounts before preparing its submission. HUD has retained the proposed provision,
and notes that with one formula amount, any difference between a presumptive estimate and a final formula amount is
eliminated. The accelerated approach which is optional, may use a dollar amount for planning purposes,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 last FFY's final formula amount, that is different from the actual formula amount for the current FFY. If there are
problems associated with that approach, the HA may continue to use the old approach (

must be received in the Field Office no later than July 15 each year in order to allow for the 75-day review period before
the end of the FFY. Since HUD will no longer provide an estimated formula amount, HUD has eliminated the requirement
for the initial notice. The level of detail and the format for the public notice has been left to local discretion.

 HUD proposed to expand the public notice requirements. HAs were to provide public notice of the advance meeting and

The information to be provided in the public notice was also to be expanded to include a summary of activities of the
previous year and progress update, estimated funding level, summary of CGP requirements, the estimated time frames
for completion of the required CGP documents and the requirement for resident participation in the planning, development
and monitoring of modernization activities under the CGP. In order to reach a much broader public, HAs stated that
they would have to use means beyond mailings to current residents. Commenters objected to the use of media such as newspapers,
radio and TV because it would greatly increase the cost to the HA, and HUD should allow an increase in the allowable administrative
costs to cover the additional expense. For the public at large, it was suggested that the HAs state that the required
information is available for inspection at various locations. Presenting a draft P&amp;E Report for all active funding
years would increase the HA's administrative burden. A simplified summary of active modernization projects and
management improvements in a format to be determined by the HA was suggested as sufficient for this stage of the process.

Other commenters found an improvement in the timing and manner of the notice, but also questioned the level of detail.
The listed details were thought to be more appropriate for the resident meetings and public hearings and the notice
should properly indicate that these details will be presented during these forums. Large HAs found there is no way
to simply summarize this information because any summary's level of detail would be so broad that the report would
be meaningless. It was also said to be impossible to summarize large HA's activities and progress on hundreds of contracts
representing hundreds of millions of dollars in contract work on any HA-wide notice. HAs requested the discretion
to provide such detail where feasible and appropriate. Recommended information in resident letters would include
basic information (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 level of funding and the time and place of the advance meeting) with the understanding that additional information
is available upon request at the HA's management office.

 HUD proposed that the HA shall hold, within a reasonable amount of time before the public hearing, an advance meeting
for residents and duly elected resident councils at which the HA shall explain the components of the Comprehensive
Plan. The meeting shall be open to all residents and duly elected resident councils. In addition, HUD requested comments
as to resident consultation regarding changes to the Five-Year Action Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters agreed that the timing of meetings with residents should be the decision of the HA. HUD was requested
to clarify to HAs, residents and HUD Field Offices that the residents' role is to advise and not approve. It was stated
that resident interest and concern are concentrated on the development in which they reside. Given the backlog of
critical work that must be done, such as replacing leaking roofs and complying with HUD mandates, there is often considerable
frustration about the inclusionary planning process when realistically there is not a lot of choice about what will
be done. Another HA noticed that resident involvement has diminished since it began conducting advance meetings.
One commenter objected to the removal of the three-week notification for a public hearing, following the advance
meeting because they considered the current rule to be a reasonable minimum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding resident consultation on changes to the Five-Year Action Plan, NAHRO suggested there is no need for a dollar
threshold nationwide. Each HA has its own method in place for consultation with residents. HAs are currently notifying
residents and their representatives and public officials about the CGP. They questioned what benefit further notification
requirements would provide. One HA proposed written notification to resident council presidents with a meeting
per local needs. They proposed to limit the definition of significant change to instances where a work item is deleted
or postponed from the Five-Year Plan. Modifications resulting from a reprogramming of unobligated funds from a work
item or in response to emergency needs should not be deemed as significant changes for resident consultation purposes.
IHAs that commented suggested that this consultation should be at the discretion of each HA. For a threshold, they
recommended that resident consultation would be in order when significant changes reach the cumulative total of
15% of the total grant amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter did not support putting the burden on the HA to create resident involvement. It was recommended that
HUD should mandate that a minimum of one notice be given to residents of the HA's intent to apply for funds combined with
a notice of one public hearing to solicit input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the proposed rule separates the planning process from the funding process, making resident
participation in the former of little consequence to the latter. Tenant consultation would have no meaningful purpose.
It was also suggested that this is inconsistent with the statute because HUD was fulfilling the resident consultation
requirements simply by engaging tenants in abstract discussions of modernization concerns, unrelated to any particular
year's funding decisions.

 The final rule incorporates the proposed rule provisions. HUD strongly recommends open and full communication between
the residents and the HA throughout the planning and funding process and believes that it is essential to achieve and
sustain viable public and Indian housing. As requested by the comments, the timing of meetings with the residents
should be at the discretion of the HA. HUD has decided not to impose thresholds on resident consultation for changes
within the Five-Year Action Plan. Although resident council involvement is not required whenever work items are
shifted within the Five-Year Action Plan, HUD believes that consultation is generally in the best interest of good
relations between the HA and the residents. The degree of consultation should be consistent with the degree of change
and that determination is at the discretion of the HA. HAs are encouraged to inform residents of significant changes.
Except for emergencies, items which are not in the Five-Year Action Plan require resident consultation and HUD approval
before being undertaken.

 HUD proposed that HAs hold annually at least one public hearing and any appropriate number of additional hearings
to ensure ample opportunity for residents, local government officials and other interested parties to express their
priorities and concerns. HAs were to give full consideration to the comments and concerns of residents, local government
officials, and other interested parties. NYCHA indicated that each year there are too many changes in their plans
to detail at the public hearing. NYCHA urged PHAs to provide detailed resident notification, and the best vehicle
for large PHAs to provide this notification is through Modernization and Maintenance Committee meetings at the development
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, it was commented that presenting a draft P&amp;E Report for all active funding years would increase
instead of decrease the HA administrative burden. The final report would need to prepared again in just a few months.
Adding the P&amp;E Reports to the agenda would compound the confusion in absorbing all this information during meetings.
A simple summary of active modernization projects and management improvements would suffice for this stage of the
process.

 In the final rule, HUD has left the level of detail up to the HA. However, the HA is required to present information on
the Comprehensive Plan/Annual Submission and progress of previously funded modernization programs. Development
level meetings are acceptable, but not required. By statute, HAs must hold at least one public hearing. The number
of additional meetings necessary is left to HA discretion.

 As part of its Comprehensive Plan, a HA is required to prepare various summaries. Some commenters questioned the level
of detail required. Rather than require less detail that would require more explanation after the fact, one HA suggested
that the required level of detail should be such that HUD will be able to make its eligibility and environmental needs
determination at the time of submission. PHADA suggested that the provision of work categories, quantity, and overall
costs, as opposed to work items and individual costs, is a workable compromise. It was requested that the rule more
clearly define the level of detail at this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue related to the level of detail was that because HUD proposes that the level of detail in the Annual Statement
and Five-Year Action Plan be consistent, this would result in increased detail in the balance of the Five-Year Plan.
It was found to be beneficial to use a consistent level of detail for all work, however a HA noted that the level of detail
should be in sufficient detail to relay the scope of work and cost for all reports,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the new Five-Year Plan and the P&amp;E Report. A further breakdown of work items in the P&amp;E Report would be an extraordinary
administrative burden for HAs and contractors and would be of questionable value and accuracy. Detailed cost documentation
exists in HA's files to support any work items that HUD would like to examine more closely.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD has adopted the recommendation that the level of detail be consistent in the Annual Statement, the Five-Year Action
Plan and the P&amp;E Report. The level of detail for physical work includes a description of major work categories,
quantity and cost. The level of detail for administrative and management improvement costs must be sufficient enough
for HUD to make a determination of eligibility. For example, the HA must describe training activities and how they
relate to identified physical or management improvement needs.

 The combination of annual statements and five-year plans at &sect;968.330 presented a statutory issue according
to ACORN. ACORN argued that this contradicts section 14(e)(3)(A) of the Act, which sets forth the requirement of PHAs
to produce an Annual Statement. Further, it was stated that this requirement is clearly distinct from the comprehensive
needs assessment and action plan described in subsections (e)(l)(A) and (e)(l)(D). ACORN stated that the combination
of the Annual Statement with the larger document will make interpretation of the single year's policymaking very
difficult. Site-specific data for residents will become confusing. Since the Five-Year Action Plan and Annual Statement
serve two distinct purposes, and since their merger will entail significant disadvantages in citizen participation,
they argued that the two should remain separate.

 It is not accurate to suggest that HUD has combined the Annual Statement and Five-Year Action Plan in a way that violates
the Act. The information related to the Annual Statement and Five-Year Action Plan remain distinguishable. The work
expected to be accomplished in each of the five years will be identified on a Work Statement for that year by major work
categories. Requiring HAs to only describe a major work category with quantity and cost without specifying work items
within a major work category is in keeping with the statutory intent of granting more flexibility to HAs and eases the
transition to full five-year fungibility. The HA must continue to provide residents with the opportunity to review
the Annual Statement and comment on it, and such comments must be taken into account in finalizing the Annual Statement
prior to submission to HUD. Definitions of Annual Statement, Work Statements and Annual Submission have been added
to the rule.

 Numerous comments were received concerning the level of detail in the Annual Statement versus the level of detail
in the P&amp;E Report. Currently, the level of detail is the same in both documents; however, in the proposed rule,
this provision was modified to require less detail in the Annual Statement and more detail in the P&amp;E Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One HA agreed with HUD's proposal to eliminate the current Annual Statement and Five-Year Action Plan and incorporate
their information into a modified Five-Year Action Plan. They agreed that requiring HAs to describe a major work category
with only quantity and cost without specifying work items is in keeping with the statutory intent of granting more
flexibility to HAs and as such eases the transition to full five-year fungibility. However, they requested that HUD
clarify the issue regarding ineligible costs in the Five-Year Action Plan. To further minimize major disagreements
at the end of the process, CLPHA recommended that HUD should clearly spell out in advance any items which HUD will consider
strictly ineligible. CLPHA urged that the list of ineligible items be shortened and that additional items be made
specifically eligible under CGP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAHR0 supported a five-year ``fungible'' approach to the CGP. However, NAHRO commented on the level of detail to be
required in the new Five-Year Action Plan. NAHRO was concerned by HUD's statement on ineligible costs. It was found
to give HAs the impression that when their P&amp;E Reports are filed with the Field Offices, work items can be disallowed
even if they are eligible expenses. In order for the Five-Year Action Plan to be ``fungible'' the actual details of
how the funds were spent should be included at the end of the year, not at the beginning, in the Annual Submission. Both
Field Offices and HAs should be familiar with eligibility of work items and guidance to both groups about eligible
costs should be clear. However, NAHRO did not want Field Offices to believe that they can disallow eligible items.
According to NAHRO, fungibility should allow the HA to decide what items they will do and where. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four IHAs indicated satisfaction with the guidance on eligible and ineligible costs, but noted that if HUD expands
and or clarify these lists, they suggest that IHA's should be included in developing such lists in light of their unique
modernization needs and differences from PHAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters questioned HUD's proposal that if the HA performs a work item that HUD will not be able to determine if
it was an eligible work item, then HA's would have to repay ineligible costs discovered during review of the P&amp;E
Report. It was suggested that this procedure could permit HUD to fail to properly review and then seek denial of funds
or reimbursement later. A better approach is for HUD to have sufficient detail in the Annual Statement in order to make
an eligibility determination up-front. This eliminates any question of how the HA should proceed. HUD still has the
authority to deny funds or seek reimbursement from the HA that has clearly performed ineligible work. The HA did not
support the Five-Year Action Plan minimal level of detail and the resulting discretion by HUD to seek reimbursement
for ineligible costs. Another suggested approach was to reduce the agency's future CGP amount to recoup the ineligible
expenditure.

CLPHA disagreed with the level of detail being proposed for the Five-Year Action Plan and for the P&amp;E Report. They
suggested that in the Five-Year Action Plan, references to quantities be eliminated and that the ``major work category''
along with a general description be considered acceptable. They acknowledged that PHAs must plan in detail, and HUD
could require them to maintain documentation in their files to support the work activities proposed. CLPHA indicated
that it would be desirable to keep the detail in the P&amp;E statements no greater than in the Five-Year Action Plan.
A further breakdown of work items in the P&amp;E Report would be a heavy administrative burden for PHAs and contractors,
and would be of questionable value and accuracy. For purposes of audits, HUD could reasonably require a PHA to keep
detailed cost documentation in its files, to support any work items that HUD would like to examine more closely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They considered the Two-Year Application a better option for reducing paperwork and the burden of review. The HA supported
the current level of detail required by the Annual Statement and Five-Year Action Plan versus the proposed Five-Year
Action Plan with one level of detail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments regarding the P&amp;E Report were mentioned and responded to above. The level of detail was the greatest
concern. One commenter noted that the proposed amendments will require them to develop the annual P&amp;E Report
in greater detail to cover a lack of detail in the Five-Year Action Plan. Generally, they had been moving from more detail
in the Physical Needs Assessment to lesser detail in their Annual P&amp;E Report. They wished to continue this practice.
They also hoped that HUD would continue to allow HA's to develop facsimiles of required HUD forms for the CGP that work
better with their housing stock while allowing them to work on the forms in spreadsheet format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To satisfy the proposed rule, one commenter thought it would have to keep two sets of records (one to prepare the limited
detail of the Five-Year Action Plan and another to write the P&amp;E Report). This change was found to not result in
any real saving of time or effort for HUD. It may reduce by, at most, two months the up-front processing time reviewing
HA submissions; however, HUD would still have to review each HA's P&amp;E Report in detail for line-item eligibility.
It was proposed that if it is beneficial for a HA to keep the current level of detail in its submitted plans and P&amp;E
Report, it should be able to do so. They suggested the following amendment: ``The Work Statement for all five years
will be, at least, at the current level of detail so that the HA may interchange work items as discussed in &sect;968.320(d)(5)(i).''
Adding any additional post-program review and evaluation was not found to be in the spirit of providing HAs with regulatory
relief. The time saved up-front is not worth the additional time spent responding to audits later on. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters recommended combining the two processes (P&amp;E Report and Annual Submission of Activities and Expenditures)
into one. One HA also requested that HAs not be burdened with generating resident interest in the preparation of this
report.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to permit full fungibility of work items in the Five-Year Action Plan, the level of detail with regard to work
items must be consistent in all five years. HUD proposed limiting the level of detail up-front to reduce administrative
burden to HAs. It was further proposed that HAs provide additional detail in the P&amp;E Report for purposes of determining
eligibility. However, after reviewing the comments, HUD agrees that the level of detail should be consistent in the
Annual Statement, the Five-Year Action Plan and the P&amp;E Report. Also, in keeping with HUD's commitment to simplify
the CGP and provide maximum flexibility wherever possible, HUD has streamlined the level of detail that must be provided.
The rule now requires HAs to specify major work categories, quantities and costs. For example, 100 kitchens at Development
X for a total of $100,000. The level of detail for administrative and management improvement costs must be sufficient
enough for HUD to make a determination of eligibility. HUD already may request additional information (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for eligibility determinations) to facilitate review and approval of the Annual Submission during the 75-day review
period. HUD notes that HAs have the responsibility for ensuring that only eligible modernization work items are charged
to the CGP. As previously noted, work items, including the purchase of equipment, must be directly related to carrying
out physical and management improvements identified in the Needs Assessments. Such work must be modest in design
and cost, but still blend in with the design and architecture of the surrounding community. HAs are advised to keep
supporting documentation relative to work items within the major work category for monitoring and auditing purposes
and such information must be made available to HUD upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD wishes to maintain a partnership with HAs throughout the CGP process and minimize concerns regarding the eligibility
of work items. Eligible work items include those which are modest in design and cost, but still blend in with the design
and architecture of the surrounding communities by including amenities, quality materials and design and landscaping
features that are customary for the locality and culture. However, if a HA has a question on the possible eligibility
of a work item, it should consult with the Field Office. Should a HA expend funds for ineligible work items, HUD will
require repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HAs may develop facsimiles of required HUD forms as long as they contain all of the required information in a format
that reasonably approximates the actual format.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Generally, IHAs supported retaining TDC while HAs preferred other methods. One PHA supported the current method
of TDC and the 90% requirement. However, the PHA suggested that, HAs have the option to use CGP funds to supplement other
funds to demo and replace units where that option is most advantageous to HUD and the HA. Thus, if the HA intends to modernize
a project at 80% of TDC, it should have the option to add 20% of other funding to demolish and rebuild the complex. This
option could require review and approval by HUD, and the Public Hearing and Resident Group review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters noted that often, the HA spends an inordinate amount of time after the architect develops the plans and
specifications trying to determine how or what should be cut from the minimum to construct the development. We should
be striving for quality not a specific quantity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters were pleased with the proposed new way of evaluating cost reasonableness, namely by evaluating the costs
of individual types of work items and comparing them with published private construction cost standards. CLPHA recommended
that a PHA be allowed to demonstrate cost reasonableness under any of the three following methods: (a) The current
approach using 90% of TDCs; (b) the cost reasonableness approach related to the cost of individual work proposed by
HUD in the proposed rule, but also allowing PHAs to submit additional data concerning local market conditions as they
relate to published cost indicators; or (c) sealed pre-bid estimates to be compared to the competitive bids received
for such work. Once approved, the definition used by the PHA would remain constant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested that HUD should allow HAs to develop their own methods of determining the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonableness of planned work. These cost evaluations should not be submitted to HUD on an annual basis and should
not have to be retained by HAs for HUD review. The time and cost of generating this kind of data in a form suitable for HUD
audit could be significant. Pre-bid estimates and competitive bids received for work should be adequate to document
the reasonableness of cost for work items. HUD was urged to use a sufficiently expansive definition of reasonable
cost to permit HAs to utilize very durable materials and construction techniques and revised modernization standards
critical to ensuring a development's long-term viability. HUD was also urged to implement a similar standard for
its development program. In particular, development cost must: (a) Be more reflective of local and changing conditions;
(b) expand beyond the modest design standards; and (c) provide adequate square footage for today's family needs.

NAHRO recommended that the reasonable cost determinations still be compared to the cost of new development. They
also suggested a viability assessment must allow both approaches, a cumulative approach, such as a comparison of
the total cost of modernization as compared to the total cost of new development or as the Department suggests, a cost
reasonable test of the work items proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PHADA applauded the removal of the artificial TDC caps, but remained concerned about the level of detail PHAs will
have to keep in their files and the form of the annual HUD review. Management choices are an essential part of this process
and they were worried about some HUD personnel second-guessing authority decisions, thus leading to huge, unnecessary,
battles. HUD was requested to clearly address the level of detail for filing in the handbook revisions. There was also
an expressed need to prevent redundant files where work is publicly bid and selected architect/engineers provide
cost estimates prior to bidding. No program benefit was found in further administrative procedures that do not impact
construction quality or timeliness of expenditures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One PHA was concerned that if HUD does not establish a procedure it will be left to Field Office definition. The PHA suggested
that local authorities be given the discretion to define reasonableness and have HUD approve the definition. Once
approved, the definition would remain constant. The issue of cost reasonableness also illustrates the need for greater
flexibility to do a cost analysis of rehabilitation of the existing units versus demolition and new construction.
While a PHA does not want to see HUD reduce its responsibility to provide a steady funding source for new construction
of public housing units, they believed that it is important to look at the cost reasonableness. The PHA was also seeking
that the revised regulations permit this flexibility in scattered sites. It could be limited to specific units where
the cost analysis demonstrated the cost-effectiveness and long-term viability of new construction.

 In the rule, HUD has clarified that long-term viability includes ensuring structural/system integrity and full
occupancy. For cost reasonableness, HUD has decided that HAs may choose one of two methods to determine cost reasonableness:
(1) unfunded modernization hard costs do not exceed 90% of computed TDC; or (2) individual work items are reasonable
in accordance with National cost indices, adjusted by local conditions and the HA's own recent procurement experience.

 All but one commenter supported HUD's proposed five-year fungibility. HAs found that full fungibility will allow
HAs more flexibility to undertake and complete rehabilitation and modernization work at their housing developments.
The elimination of the need for preparing amendments for HUD approval before work items may be interchanged from one
year to another was predicted to save countless hours for both HAs and HUD Field Offices. While HAs wholeheartedly
supported fungibility, some indicated a preference for it to be based on the Needs Assessments, rather than the Five-Year
Action Plan. HAs stated a general principle that once a HA has established a need in their Needs Assessments, they would
not have to request prior approval from HUD to fund that item. The condition of a development's physical plant can change
dramatically from one year to the next. HAs, not HUD, were found to be in a better position to decide what work items need
to be funded and when. Any extra level of approval was seen as not keeping with HUD's goal of increasing HA discretion
and responsibility. It was also asserted that this would enable HAs to better and more rapidly address changing conditions
without an extensive, interim public and HUD review process. Such reviews were considered more appropriate at the
annual submission and performance and evaluation stages of the CGP. However, some HAs and CLPHA opposed the proposed
requirement for HUD approval of any item not included in the current five-year plan as unrealistic, overly restrictive
and would negate the benefits intended by full fungibility. Preparing budget revision proposals and the turnaround
time involved in seeking HUD approval could result in project delays. With the increased emphasis for timely obligation
and expenditure of funds, they were concerned that this restriction would make those goals more difficult to achieve.
It was recommended that HAs should be able to add items to their current year modernization activities without HUD
approval if these items are shown in their needs assessment (even if not included in the HA's Five-Year Action Plan),
or are of similar type to items in their approved plan. HAs should also be able to add emergency items, or items certified
by the HA as otherwise eligible and approvable, without further approval from HUD, provided that any items so added
will not result in the deletion of any work item from the Five-Year Action Plan. Only if a HA proposes to delete an item
from its Five-Year Action Plan should it have to notify HUD, or changes should be allowed for any item identified in
an approved needs assessment up to a predetermined percentage cap. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One HA supported the proposal to allow a HA to perform emergency work not outlined in its Five-Year Action Plan without
prior HUD approval. As an incentive for high performers, one HA suggest that high performers should be allowed to not
report on changes in excess of 10% of the grant other than on the yearly P&amp;E Report, along with giving a reason for
the change.

 HUD has adopted the proposed version of fungibility. HUD has not revised its approach to be based on the Needs Assessments
because it would be too broad and would circumvent the resident and local government consultation requirements.
HAs are currently able to add emergency work items, and will continue to be able to do so without HUD approval. HAs cannot
add other work items to the Five-Year Action Plan without HUD approval. Full fungibility will be allowed within the
five-year period spanned by the latest HUD-approved Five-Year Action Plan. It should also be noted that the five-year
fungibility eliminates the need to report on changes in excess of 10% of the annual grant other than on the yearly P&amp;E
Report.

 One commenter saw a need to define fungibility in the rule. The following definition of fungibility was proposed:
``Fungibility. The ability to exchange CIAP or Comprehensive Grant program dollars or work items prospectively
or retroactively, between any years covered by an ACC, Five-Year Action Plan or Needs Assessment.'' It was also noted
that additional references to ``fungibility'' should be altered to conform to this definition.

 Fungibility is a concept reflected throughout the rule. Fungibility permits a HA to substitute any work item from
the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan to any previously approved CIAP budget or CGP Annual Statement and to move
work items among approved budgets without prior HUD approval. This definition of fungibility appears in the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NYCHA indicated that applying fungibility only to those jobs included in the current Five-Year Action Plan is too
restrictive. This HA wanted to be able to apply the fungibility principle to unobligated work items_past, present,
or future (currently in either an approved implementation schedule or their needs assessment (including both CIAP
and CGP-funded items)). By authorizing ``retroactive fungibility'' in the CGP rule and with guidance in the Handbook,
NYCHA expected a significant increase in PHA flexibility and responsiveness to modernization needs. NYCHA suggested
that retroactive fungibility will allow a PHA to close out its older programs on schedule and will also aid in reprogramming
underruns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the time period for the fungibility of work items, it was suggested that full fungibility should be
allowed within the five-year period spanned by a Five-Year Action Plan's rolling base. If fungibility is tied to our
initial Five-Year Action Plan (submitted in FFY 92), they expected to move work items from FFY 96 into their FFY 94 CGP
budget, but not items from FFY 97. If fungibility is tied to the rolling base Five-Year Action Plan, developed each
year by dropping off the initial year and adding a subsequent year for their Annual Submission, they could move work
items from FFY 98 into their FFY 94 CGP budget. Another commenter found it would be much simpler to have a fixed five-year
period with changes and updates made annually to that plan. In the fifth year a new Five-Year Action Plan for the next
five years would be submitted and approved. This HA found a lot of difficulty in trying to explain to residents that
the first year of the 1993 budget was the same as the second year of the 1992 budget but that they were different because
some items had been revised or changed.

 HUD does not agree with the suggestions that fungibility should apply to all unobligated work items and any work items
in the Needs Assessment. If HUD permitted the use of the Needs Assessments for purposes of fungibility, the five-year
planning and resident partnership processes could be circumvented. The Five-Year Action Plan has a rolling base
and is updated annually. The approval of the Five-Year Action Plan submitted for the current FFY supersedes other
previously approved Five-Year Action Plans. For example, the current Five-Year Action Plan may cover FFYs 1994&hyph;1998.
However, a HA may substitute a major work category from the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan into a 1992 CGP or
a 1991 CIAP budget, but it cannot substitute work that only appears in the Needs Assessments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be clarified that HUD approval is not required for moving previously approved work among previously approved
budgets. In addition, HUD approval is not required for reprogramming if funds remain after completion of a work item
where the funds will be used for any item in the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan or an approved CIAP budget or Annual
Statement. The HA may also self-execute a time extension, if necessary, to use the leftover funds.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the proposed rule, fungibility centers on the interchangeability of work items between funding programs prior
to obligation. However, for one large HA, fungibility of dollars during the expenditure period would be just as useful.
Numerous circumstances beyond a PHA's control can make it impossible to close a contract, and with it the funding program,
within the five-year statutory limit. When such circumstances occur, the monies remaining in a funding program about
to expire should be used for payments on contracts in later funding programs. In a sense, PHAs would be creating post-award,
``split funded'' contracts. Fungibility of dollars is the expenditure version of using old money first. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Post-obligation fungibility of contract dollars would allow PHAs to closeout old funding programs within the five-year
funding deadline and would yield a more accurate picture of the PHAs ability to expend modernization funds. The rule
should provide directly for post-obligation fungibility, and this important subject should not be left for handbook
interpretation, as suggested in the proposed rule's preamble.

 As previously noted, there is no statutory five-year funding deadline. HUD wishes to emphasize that fungibility
relates to major work categories, not dollars. The dollars approved in a particular grant, e.g., 701, are tracked
against that grant number. A HA may fund work categories in total or in part from a particular grant. If the cost of a work
category is in excess of the funds available in 701, the HA may charge up to the total amount of funds remaining in 701
and add that work category to another grant, e.g., 702. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department issued Notice PIH 94&hyph;13 (HA), Expediting Obligation/Expenditure of Modernization Funds in
the Pipeline, on April 6, 1994. HAs should refer to this Notice which specifically discusses methods which HAs may
wish to use to obligate and expend their oldest modernization funds before charging work against newer programs.

 One commenter suggested a revised CGP process. It would require an approval process only every five years. The plan
would be updated annually with changes made to reflect actual funding costs as tasks are completed, items added and/or
deleted from the Plan or moved to different years. A new fifth year would not be added each year. Only new items added
to the Plan would require HUD approval and interim year changes would require documented consultation with the tenants
at a public meeting. PHAs could expend funds from any grant year against any item in the approved Plan. An example of
a Plan was also provided.

As previously mentioned only one commenter opposed the proposed fungibility provisions. They argued that this was
an attempt to circumvent the statutory five-year planning requirements. They asserted that full fungibility is
inconsistent with the Act because it violated the requirement of a schedule to prioritize work items during the Five-Year
Action Plan. The full fungibility was said to remove the scheduled order of the planning process. The second perceived
inconsistency was the exemption of HAs from the amendment process outlined in the Act which describes how changes
to the approved plan may be made. They interpreted the Act to require HAs to wait until their submission of an annual
statement, with appropriate tenant consultation and public comment, before elements of the comprehensive plan
are to be changed. It was also stated that full fungibility is bad public policy. The proposed rule gives HAs absolute
discretion over modernization funds upon award. They found this to be an abdication of Federal responsibility. They
asserted that this approach is also problematic because modernization is a troubled program with an enormous pipeline
and an inability to impact the profound repair needs in public housing. HUD was charged with the failure of the modernization
program due to its poor oversight and HA's weak management practices and financial operations.

 HUD cannot change the comprehensive grant process to a once every five years submission process. The Act requires
an Annual Statement. The Five-Year Action Plan is also a statutory requirement. Fungibility is not inconsistent
with the Act. The Act provides that as long as the activities and expenditures are consistent with the approved plan,
the HA shall have total discretion in expending assistance for any activity or work set forth in the plan. HAs are to
certify that they have provided residents of the housing affected by the planned activities the opportunity to review
the Annual Statement and comment on it, and that such comments have been taken into account in formulating the Annual
Statement as submitted to the Secretary.

 The Act requires that work items be included in a Comprehensive Plan or Annual Statement before modernization funds
may be spent on the work items, except in the case of emergencies. The Act also provides that work items may not appear
in the Annual Statement or Five-Year Action Plan unless the need for the work has been identified in the Physical or
Management Needs Assessments. Therefore, this comment was not accepted because the Needs Assessments have to be

 HAs and CLPHA objected to the requirement for submission of a totally new Comprehensive Plan in the sixth year of a HA's
participation in the CGP, but suggested allowing HAs to keep updating the Five-Year Action Plan's rolling base so
that it would continue indefinitely. Another comment was that the requirement for a development-by-development
analysis of whether the improvements will (a) reasonably ensure the long-term viability of the development at a reasonable
cost or (b) is necessary to maintain habitability until residents can be relocated does not accomplish any purpose.
Another commenter suggested that HUD's inclusion of ``essential non-routine maintenance necessary to maintain
habitability'' is good but requires further clarification (such as including routine maintenance costs that are
excessively high as a direct result of the units' need for comprehensive modernization work).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD has retained the requirement for the submission of an updated Comprehensive Plan every sixth year. However, the
submission requirements have been reduced by eliminating two components of the Executive Summary, which are the
strategy statement and the statement regarding the HA's plans for developments funded for comprehensive modernization
under CIAP. Therefore, the additional documents which must be submitted in the sixth year are: Summary of total preliminary
estimated costs; description of the resident participation process and summary of general issues; and revised and
updated Physical and Management Needs Assessments. The Five-Year Action Plan, which is also part of the Comprehensive
Plan, must be submitted in any case. While HAs may elect to update annually the Physical and Management Needs Assessments
by eliminating work already funded and adding newly identified work, there is no requirement for HAs to submit these
updates to HUD. HAs are only required to submit updated Needs Assessments to HUD if they wish to undertake work which
was not previously identified on the Needs Assessments. HUD feels that a completely updated Comprehensive Plan every
sixth year will provide valuable information to both HUD and the public on how well the CGP is meeting HA needs, as well
as the types and dollar estimates of unmet needs.

The Act requires the development-by-development analysis of whether the improvements will reasonably ensure the
long-term viability of the development at a reasonable cost. HUD has added the alternative of maintaining habitability
where reasonable cost cannot be met and an interim period is needed to provide housing until relocation for the residents
can be arranged. When providing ``essential non-routine maintenance necessary to maintain habitability'', a HA
is required to do so in the most efficient and economical manner and within the eligibility guidelines of the CGP. Routine
maintenance costs are ineligible. However, work items that would ordinarily be performed on a regular basis but have
become substantial in scope because they have been put off, and involve expenditures that would otherwise materially
distort the level trend of maintenance expenses are eligible CGP costs under the definition of nonroutine maintenance.

mechanics in the process. Similar questions as previously raised above were expressed on the fungibility of work
items between years and the requirement for HAs to consult to the extent practicable with residents on significant
changes. One HA noted that based on their experience with HUD, the term practicable imposed an impossibly high standard

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters raised the same issues on the annual submission procedures as they did for the Five-Year Action Plan and
Comprehensive Plan. Most HAs agreed that they would prefer to develop their preliminary plans based upon the amount
of money they had received in the prior year, and not finalize these plans until HUD announces the final amounts for
the current year. The public notice, advance meetings, public hearing, and level of detail concerned many commenters.
Commenters also suggested that either some parameters be defined regarding the time allotment for corrections or
that some other mechanism be defined by which a HA may have recourse to unreasonable time constraints. Commenters
supported the proposal authorizing HAs to self-execute an extension of target dates contained in the annual submission
for fund obligation and expenditure when a delay outside of its control occurs. Penalties for missed target dates
concerned the commenters. One HA suggested an option of a two-year application that eliminates one year of application.
NAHRO suggested that the P&amp;E Report be submitted at the same time as the annual submission of the Five-Year Action
Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters supported the proposal which requires only an annual report and its intent to involve HA residents. However,
HUD was directed not to place a burden on HAs to create resident interest and councils. It was proposed that HUD should
mandate that HAs make information available, and the methods and format should be left to local discretion. Only one
hearing each year was recommended and advanced meetings were not needed because the residents should have been working
on the plan and know what it contains. HUD was asked to develop a system by which it could certify that authorities with
effective resident participation processes would not have to have an advance hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CLPHA agreed that HAs should be allowed the option of advance planning, to complete their annual updates before the
final modernization awards are announced. However, they urged HUD not to require HAs to do this because local circumstances
vary.

 These comments have been addressed above. HUD again emphasizes that the Annual Statement is statutory. HUD reviews
the P&amp;E Report before approving the next year's submission in order to determine if corrective actions are needed.
Therefore, NAHRO's suggestion for simultaneous submission could hinder early approval of the Annual Statement
and access to funds. HAs must be accountable to the residents. There must be a partnership process which is documented.
HAs must annually conduct both an advance meeting and a public hearing. The format has been left to HA discretion. Also,
as previously mentioned, HUD is providing the option for advance planning.

 As previously mentioned in other comments, it was suggested that this section should also clarify timeliness. When
referring to the obligation of funds, it was suggested that it should make reference to legitimate self-executed
time extensions and also take into consideration any other delays that were outside of the HA's control.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Timeliness includes meeting HUD-approved implementation schedules, or HA-executed time extensions which are
the result of delays beyond the control of the HA. HUD annually reviews these schedules and may review these schedules
more frequently as needed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters emphasized that HAs should be given discretion, flexibility, responsibility and control of their CGPs.
Changes to the CGP program should contribute to the greater discretion, flexibility, responsibility and control
of the local HAs and their residents. HAs should maintain control over methods of working with and meeting with residents,
determining and prioritizing needed improvements, determining the methods to accomplish these improvements,
establishing budgets, generating bid documents, entering into contracts, and determining the clearest methods
of providing HUD with required information such as comprehensive plans, annual submissions and P&amp;E Reports.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters recommended that HUD eliminate the thresholds for LOCCS/VRS because they found the threshold amounts
are insufficient and result in Field Office review for approval. They found this is often time consuming and results
in delays in payments and delays in fund expenditure. HAs favored eliminating the percentage limitations on monthly
draw-downs. In addition, it was recommended that the eight percent draw-down limit be lifted for high performers.
It was noted that because the modernization process results in low levels of expenditure during early design phases
and high levels of expenditures when one or more construction contracts are in process, HAs have frequently exceeded
the percentage limitation and delayed requesting funds or sought HUD approval to request additional funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 LOCCS/VRS contains an edit limiting the total cumulative amount that any HA can draw down in a current month without
triggering Field Office review. The limit is set forth as a percentage of the annual grant and varies by size of the annual
grant (from 2 percent to 8 percent). The Department is reevaluating these percentages to determine if they are overly
restrictive and result in an excessive number of requisitions requiring Field Office review. If the Department finds
this to be the case, the Department will adjust the percentages accordingly. However, it should be noted that Field
Office review should not result in lengthy delays in payment. When a HA's voucher is flagged for review, the HA should
immediately call the Field Office and explain the circumstances. Based on the HA's telephone explanation, the Field
Office may decide to release the voucher or request additional documentation. Extensive documentation is not needed
in most cases.

 Once the ACC amendment is executed by HUD, the Field Office must enter the Budget Line Items (BLIs) into LOCCS/VRS before
HAs may requisition funds. The Field Office may not enter the BLIs into LOCCS/VRS before the fund obligation (ACC amendment)
is recorded in the Program Accounting System (PAS).

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter opposed entering expended and obligated funds into LOCCS on a quarterly basis because it requires extensive
research and data preparation as well as requiring more frequent budget revisions. A two-day turnaround on the supply
of funds through the LOCCS was requested (currently it is three days). Full fungibility was also requested to be reflected
in LOCCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department believes that obtaining quarterly information on obligations and expenditures is essential to monitoring
implementation progress by HAs. This requirement should not be burdensome since HAs should be maintaining this information
as part of their own financial systems and controls. The Department would like to point out that the need for budget
revisions triggered by obligations and expenditures will be greatly diminished by the provision of fungibility.

 The Department has taken steps to revise the existing BLI edits in LOCCS/VRS to accommodate fungibility. Specifically,
the existing soft edit of 110% will be removed for the following BLIs: 1430, 1440, 1450, 1460, 1465, 1470, 1475, and
1495. In addition, the existing edits for BLIs 1408 and 1410 will be revised.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters suggested changes regarding space guidelines. One PHA suggested that HUD should delete the maximum
space guidelines for administrative, maintenance and community space. Instead, PHAs should determine the amount
of space, the configuration of space and type of space appropriate based on the intended usage. The needs and usages
of space were stated to vary widely and did not warrant an arbitrary imposition of a set square footage criteria. Providing
space for service providers serving HA residents including community organizations, Head Start, early childhood
education, parent education, English as a second language, medical clinics, food shelf, teen centers, drug elimination
activities, employment and Section 3 training, family self-sufficiency should be a high priority for use of these
HUD funds.

 Non-dwelling space standards are to be viewed as guidance, not mandatory. HAs may exceed the standards. However,
the Department notes that modernization funds may be used only to provide space which is primarily for the benefit
of the public housing residents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Another PHA suggested that HAs should have the ability to convert all existing non-dwelling space (whether previous
dwelling space or not) into dwelling space. This ability could ease the unit loss impact of complying with Section
504 as well as address design deficiency conditions.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The CGP Handbook 7485.3 cites the extension of exterior walls to enlarge interior dwelling space or provide for physical
accessibility as an ineligible work item. HUD has decided to revise its policy and to amend the regulations to allow
the adding of dwelling space to existing units, including Mutual Help and Turnkey III units. However, it is noted that
HAs are not required to exercise this option in order to meet 504 requirements. Modernization funds may not be used
to construct or acquire additional public housing units. The HA may use its own funds to provide additional dwelling
units, but without a reservation of development funds, such units will not be covered by the ACC and, therefore, not
included in the operating subsidy calculation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One comment was received which indicated that the proposal to require HUD conduct environmental reviews of all proposed
activities in the Five-Year Action Plan should be a part of the burden on the HA to obtain an independent environmental
analysis and submit it to HUD prior to modernization activities occurring. The commenter concluded that HUD did not
have the travel funds nor the staff to do this type of review and suggested that HAs could hire and train residents out
of management improvement funds to perform these reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is required by law to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and related environmental
and historic preservation laws before approving funding for specific developments. The provision for fungibility
of work within the entire Five-Year Action Plan means that the Department must make this determination on an annual
basis for each development within the Five-Year Action Plan. This responsibility cannot be delegated to HAs. On April
11, 1994, S. 1299 became law, and added, among other things, a new Section 26 to the United States Housing Act of 1937,
as amended. This new Section 26 authorizes the Department to designate a State or unit of general local government
to assume the responsibilities for environmental review. The authorization for State and local governments to conduct
such reviews continues a statutory precedent embodied in the legislation of other HUD programs. The delegations
are limited to entities with general governmental powers to control development, land use, development standards
and special mitigation requirements. HAs do not possess these powers and do not qualify for such delegations. In order
to implement this new Section 26, the Department must issue regulations after consultation with the Council on Environmental
Quality. Until those regulations are issued, the Department must continue to comply with NEPA and related environmental
and historic preservation laws by undertaking the required reviews itself and cannot delegate any responsibilities
to State or local governments. In addition, it should be noted that Field Offices are encouraged to maintain previously
completed environmental reviews on file and update them as necessary when undertaking the required reviews.

Comments:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments were made on HUD's discussion of procurement procedures in the preamble to the proposed rule.
CLPHA indicated that PHAs have identified possible conflicts between comprehensive grant procurement procedures
and the requirements of other HUD procurement rules. CLPHA recommended that HUD ask PHAs for recommendations in this
area, then follow up to clarify these areas and provide PHAs with greater flexibility and consistency. One PHA wanted
to see additional information addressing contract administration in the revised CGP Handbook. PHAs and CLPHA recommended
an extensive review of procurement requirements to identify proper and appropriate ways to simplify or ease how HAs
contract for work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suggested items included establishing procedures for HAs to better utilize alternative procurement vehicles like
state procurement, job order contracting, and a revived, modified HUD Consolidated Supply Program and accelerating
the approval process of HUD Form 5230, the Previous Participation Certificate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A PHA suggested the use of competitive proposals and indicated that the seven percent administrative cost limit would
not be required to be increased because it would be part of the contract cost. Another commenter disagreed and indicated
that this method was not successful for development of public housing units and would not be appropriate for modernization
except on a small scale at a limited number of HAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's clarification on the use of indefinite quantity contracts for A/E services and the ability to perform modernization
work through competitive proposals was viewed as a real benefit in expediting construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One PHA disagreed with the limit on modifications or contract modifications in the Handbook (7460.8, REV.1 dated
1/14/93, paragraph 11&hyph;1 (e). They challenged the rational for this requirement since they may award construction
contracts exceeding several million dollars without prior HUD approval, but must obtain HUD approval on all contract
modifications exceeding $25,000. In addition, HAs are not required to forward contract documents to the Field Offices
which would appear to make it difficult to approve any contract modification. The present process was found to slow
down construction. It was requested that HAs be allowed to authorize contract modifications up to 10% of the original
contract amount without prior HUD approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CLPHA commented that pre-qualification of vendors should be encouraged and expedited.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Seven comments were received on HUD's proposal to monitor each HA's Section 3 efforts. One commenter noted that HUD
did not specify which division or department would do this, and recommended that training should be provided. One
commenter cautioned HUD on the impact its proposals would have on CGP and recommended HUD gather input from people
who work in this area. To further Section 3 efforts, a PHA suggested that residents registered with the HA as trainees
be exempt from the HUD-determined wage Rates and Davis-Bacon wage rates. The resident trainee rates could be approved
by HUD the same as HUD determined wage rates. By analogy to Connecticut law, one PHA noted that their housing construction
programs required 25% of the dollar value of the contract be sub-contracted to Minority Business Enterprises and
that 25% of that amount be awarded to Women's Business Enterprises. This was stated to produce verifiable results
and has been very effective. Another PHA supported HUD's effort and suggested HA's focus more of their resources on
the Section 3 process and involve more residents in the distribution of work and training program. CLPHA indicated
that by FFY 95, HUD expects to have an effective final rule implementing the amended Section 3 which proposes that PHAs
certify as to compliance with Section 3 and provide anticipated projections based on best efforts. PHAs can certify
as to compliance with Section 3 but CLPHA stated it was unreasonable to expect projections as to the number of jobs or
type of training available through various contracts. This was found to only be determined by the successful contractor.
The additional costs of carrying out Section 3 training should also be taken into account in evaluating bids according
to CLPHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAHRO disagreed with any request for numerical targets because annual targets are influenced by a number of factors
beyond the PHA's or contractor's control, and monitoring and reporting regarding such targets creates paper games.
NAHRO did not find a program-by-program approach to necessarily be effective in creating real employment for residents.
NAHRO recommended that PHAs establish goals authority-wide to comply with Section 3, of which CGP is one component.
To foster successful implementation of Section 3, HUD should work with public housing industry groups as well as contractors
and unions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Section 3) (as amended by the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992) requires that employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal financial assistance
for housing and community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed toward low- and
very low-income persons, particularly, those who are recipients of government assistance for housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of Section 3 apply to HAs for modernization activities, notwithstanding the amount of the assistance
provided to the HA or the amount of the contract or subcontract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For CGP, the Section 3 rule requires HAs to certify compliance with Section 3 and demonstrate this compliance by committing
``to the greatest extent feasible'' to meet the numerical goals set in the Section 3 interim rule (24 CFR 135.30). For
CGP, HUD requested through the letter transmitting the FY 1994 presumptive estimate, that each HA to the greatest
extent feasible, establish and commit to numerical goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each HA is required to submit, with the annual P&amp;E Report, an annual Section 3 report on Form HUD&hyph;60002. The
HA must document actions taken to comply with the requirements of Section 3, the results of actions taken and impediments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the process of development of the Section 3 interim rule and data collection, the Department held meetings
with various housing authorities, industry groups and organizations which are currently subject to compliance
with Section 3 or share interest in the regulatory implementation of Section 3.

 Three commenters concluded that a constant or increasing level of funding for CGP is required if HAs are to complete
required improvements on public housing properties to ensure their long-term viability. Decreases in funding levels
results in only emergency work being completed and destroys HA's ability to do long range planning and follow thorough
on commitments made to the residents. Significant decreases from year to year (anything exceeding 10%) was stated
to result in delays in implementing completed design work (risking the need to revise work based on changing existing
conditions) and decreased resident participation and interest.

 Wage rate determinations have become increasingly problematic in their timing and completeness. They are received
after contracts are executed and sometimes many months of construction has already been completed. Often there is
no wage rate determination given for requested classifications.

 The Department is unaware of any widespread or systemic problems involving the provision of Davis-Bacon wage determinations
for modernization projects. HUD is installing a Davis-Bacon wage determination database to expedite the provision
of determinations.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Expedite wage-rate issuances. HUD should expedite Davis-Bacon issuances and eliminate variances between HUD and
DOL requirements. The date of the wage decision should be the date of the start of the contract. HAs shouldn't have to
delay opening of the bids because of a ``pending wage decision.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD works closely with DOL to assure that wage determinations are made available for projects in a timely manner. This
means that the wage determinations must be made available for incorporation into bid solicitations. There are projects
which are subject to HUD-determined wage rates (``non-routine'' maintenance) rather than DOL-determined wage
rates which are issued under the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts. Resultant variations in wages which may be issued are
due to the fact that the work is defined differently and the rates are determined under separate legal authorities.
The applicable Davis-Bacon wage determination for a particular project is ``locked in'' at the award of the contract.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An HA suggests that HUD encourage local expenditures. Although Consolidated Supply type programs provide competitive
rates, they do nothing for the local economy. The HA suggested that HUD emphasize the ``buy locally'' proposition
in order to best stimulate the HA's local economy.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HAs are required to follow the Department's regulation at 24 CFR 85.36 for the procurement of goods and services. This
regulation was developed pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;102, Uniform Administrative
Requirements for Grants to State and Local Governments, to provide consistent government-wide procurement standards
in Federal grant programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the fundamental principles of the regulation is that all procurements are to be conducted in a manner to promote
full and open competition. The principle is intended to ensure equal treatment among contractors, while providing
the most advantageous prices in the market place, particularly when the Federal government is providing the funds.
Consistent with the concept of providing equal treatment among contractors is a specific requirement in the regulation
prohibiting the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-state or local geographical preferences in the
award of contracts. Further, restricting competition to local contractors will not yield HAs the best prices in the
market place. This is particularly important with limited Federal resources. Accordingly, the Department does
not accept the comment that HUD should emphasize the ``buy locally'' proposition in order to stimulate the HA's local
economy.

HUD Assistance: Handbook and Field Offices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nine comments provided advice on better ways to give assistance to program participants. One suggestion was to reinforce
the concept of enhanced flexibility with rational handbook guidelines and grant Field Offices sufficient authority
to adapt the regulation to local conditions. Field Office and PHA partnerships were praised such as the relationship
between the St. Paul HA and the Minneapolis Field Office. Further delegation of approvals and discretion to Field
Offices was suggested. Additional Field Office staff training was recommended. The Handbook was found to be deficient
on implementation guidance. IHAs expressed a need for extensive assistance on the new rule. Four IHAs also strongly
recommended that each Office of Native American Programs should have a full time CIAP/CGP Director/Coordinator
or fund NAIHC additional monies to allow them to give technical assistance to those IHAs needing additional support.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD was directed to give clear, strict instructions to its Field Offices that establish time deadlines for Field Office
action on HA requests, including approvals of RFPs, recommendations for awards, 2530 approvals and approving of
waivers. If HUD does not act within 14 days, HAs suggested that the items should be approved. Departmental review and
approval of CGP submissions was also mentioned as improving but HAs wanted mandated deadlines for HUD approval and
no continuous review of previous approvals. Field Office oversight of troubled HAs was criticized for lacking in
clear direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CLPHA and the NYCHA recommended that HUD's rules and procedures for CGP should vary much more widely to acknowledge
the differences between modernization programs at HAs of different sizes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD will take these comments regarding better assistance to program participants into account when it revises the
CGP Handbook. Recently, HUD completed its reorganization of the Field Offices. Regional Offices were eliminated
and revised delegations of authority were provided to the Field Offices. IHAs are advised that technical assistance
is already in place. HUD will make its best efforts to provide timely reviews. However, HUD cannot always respond to
HA requests within 14 days in all cases.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 CLPHA requested that HUD allow HAs much wider latitude in meeting 504 requirements, to take into account the current
configuration of buildings and units and the comparative suitability of individual buildings for 504 modifications.
They also requested that HUD speed up its decisions concerning 504 requirements under modernization and noted that
Field Offices sometimes make unreasonable demands on the HAs, and there is no official HUD guidance in this area.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is unclear what the commenter intended. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a civil rights statute.
The current regulation at 24 CFR part 8 provides HAs with a considerable amount of latitude to take into consideration
current building and site configuration. When an HA undertakes new construction or substantial or other alterations
with respect to a given project, the HA has the authority to determine which are the units, buildings and sites in which
the required number of accessible units will be located. The following are several examples of how the regulation
provides latitude:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Section 8.23(b) of the regulation requires that when ``other alterations'' are undertaken, accessible units be
provided to ``the maximum extent feasible.'' The regulation indicates that this requirement shall not be interpreted
as requiring that an HA make a dwelling unit accessible if doing so would impose an undue financial and administrative
burden on the operation of the development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Section 8.26 requires that units be distributed throughout developments and sites and shall be available in a range
of sizes and amenities. The regulation, however, indicates that this provision shall not be construed to require
the provision of an elevator solely for the purpose of permitting the location of accessible units above or below grade
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Section 8.32 provides that compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) shall be deemed
to comply with the 504 requirements and that departures from UFAS are permitted where substantially equivalent or
greater access to and usability of the building is provided. Since the regulation does not mandate the use of UFAS,
the HA is free to use another standard as long as it is at least equal to or greater than this standard. Further, this part
of the regulation indicates that the HA is not required to make building alterations that have little likelihood of
being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the Department believes that HAs do have wide latitude in determining the location of accessible units, it is
important to emphasize that such latitude should not be construed as relieving HAs from the specific requirements
mandated by the statute or regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also is unclear why Field Offices should be slow making decisions concerning 504 requirements. Further,
the Department disagrees that there is ``no guidance'' with respect to 504 requirements. The requirements for compliance
with Section 504 are outlined in 24 CFR part 8 and UFAS. There may be individual unusual or unique situations which require
a more detailed solution in order for particular design to meet these requirements.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One HA found it impossible to accomplish a comprehensive improvement program for a given development because of the
incremental approach resulting from CGP. Developments with needs for major redesign of obsolete systems have inadequate
funds to complete this work. A solution proposed was to eliminate the requirement that prohibits previous use of CIAP
or CGP funds on a development seeking MROP eligibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD is seeking repeal of MROP. There is a statutory prohibition against using modernization funds on a building being
funded with MROP funds. HUD's Office of General Counsel has determined that this prohibition does not last forever.
Accordingly, the Department has determined that a development or a building which has been funded under MROP after
FFY 1988 is eligible for modernization funding if it has reached DOFA. Also, a development or a building which has been
funded under MROP during FFYs 1986&hyph;1988 is eligible for modernization funding if all MROP funds have been expended.

The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The rule provides revisions to the existing CGP under which HAs receive modernization assistance
from HUD on the basis of a formula. HUD does not anticipate a significant economic impact on small entities since HAs
will continue to carry out their modernization activities by entering into contracts for the work as they now do.

Federalism,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their
political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review
under the order. The revised CGP is consistent with federalism principles since it reduces unnecessary burdens on
HAs. While the program is revised, the primary change is only in the way that HUD processes and reviews HA modernization
activities, and not the modernization activities. Since participation by HAs is discretionary, this rule lacks
the direct and substantial effects on HAs required for a policy with federalism implications under the Order.

or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.
The rule does not have the potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, or general well-being,

On February 26, 1990, the Department published an interim rule (24 CFR part 87) advising recipients and subrecipients
of Federal contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and loans of a prohibition mandated by Congress. Section 319
of the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;121, approved October 23, 1989) generally
prohibits recipients of Federal contracts, grants, and loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive
or Legislative branches of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The interim
rule generally prohibits the awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient
has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying. In addition, the recipient must also file a disclosure
if it has made or has agreed to make any payment with nonappropriated funds that would be prohibited, if paid with appropriated
funds. IHAs established by an Indian Tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded from
coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from the statute's coverage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certification and disclosure requirements apply to all grants in excess of $100,000. All potential grantees
are required to submit the certification, and to make the required disclosure if the grant amount exceeds $100,000.
Potential grantees should refer to 24 CFR part 87 for the language for the certification and disclosure. The law provides
substantial monetary penalties for failure to file the required certification or disclosure.

For each FFY, HUD shall reserve from amounts approved in the appropriation act for grants under this part and part 968
of this title, $75 million (which shall include unused reserve amounts carried over from previous FFYs), which shall
be made available to IHAs and PHAs for modernization needs resulting from natural and other disasters, and from emergencies.
HUD shall replenish this reserve at the beginning of each FFY so that it always begins with a $75 million balance. Any
unused funds from previous years will remain in the reserve until allocated. The requirements governing the reserve
for disasters and emergencies and the procedures by which an IHA may request such funds, are set forth in &sect;905.667.

. Eligible modernization work on any Turnkey III units that have been paid-off, but not conveyed, by the time the CIAP
application or CGP Annual Statement is submitted, is limited to work which is necessary to meet statutory requirements
(e.g., accessibility for disabled persons, lead-based paint testing, interim containment, professional risk
assessment and abatement). Such work must be completed prior to conveyance. Turnkey III units that have not been paid-off
at the time the CIAP application or CGP Annual Statement is submitted and for which work is included in the CIAP application
or CGP Annual Statement, are eligible for any physical improvements provided under &sect;905.666(d) even where
the units are subsequently paid-off before the work is completed, so long as the work is completed prior to conveyance.

. An IHA may use CIAP or CGP funds under this subpart for the purposes of modernizing a Mutual Help unit which is paid-off,
but not conveyed, and may do so only with a unit which the IHA has identified in its CIAP application or Comprehensive
Plan (including Five-Year Action Plan and Annual Statement). In accordance with the provisions of &sect;905.440
(e)(8), an IHA may perform non-emergency work on a paid-off Mutual Help unit only after all delinquencies are repaid.

e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, accessibility for disabled persons, lead-based paint testing, interim containment, professional risk assessment,
and abatement) and the correction of development deficiencies. Notwithstanding the above requirement, an IHA may,
with prior HUD approval, complete non-emergency physical improvements on any homeownership unit where the IHA demonstrates
that, due to economies of scale or geographic constraints, substantial cost savings may be realized by completing
all necessary work in a development at one time.

. Eligible costs include alterations, betterments, additions, replacements, and non-routine maintenance that
are necessary to meet the modernization and energy conservation standards prescribed in &sect;905.603. These mandatory
standards may be exceeded only when the IHA determines that it is necessary or highly desirable for the long-term physical
and social viability of the individual development. If demolition or disposition is proposed, the IHA shall comply
with 24 CFR part 905, subpart M. Additional dwelling space may be added to existing units.

for substantial rehabilitation and subsequent sale. In addition, an IHA must demonstrate in its needs assessment
that the IHA has homebuyers who are both eligible for homeownership, in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR
part 905 (Subpart G), and who have demonstrated their intent to be placed into each of the Turnkey III units proposed
to be substantially rehabilitated;

(for IHAs participating in CIAP), from the reserve established under &sect;905.601(b). However, emergency reserve
funds may not be provided to an IHA participating in CGP that has the necessary funds available from any other source,
including its annual formula allocation under &sect;905.601(e) and (f), other unobligated modernization funds,
and its replacement reserves under &sect;905.666. An IHA is not required to have an approved comprehensive plan under
&sect;905.672 before it can request emergency assistance from this reserve. Emergency reserve funds may not be provided
to an IHA participating in CIAP unless it does not have the necessary funds available from any other source, including
unobligated CIAP, and no CIAP modernization funding is available from HUD for the remainder of the fiscal year.

General.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The plan shall include, on a development-by-development basis, an analysis of whether completion of the improvements
and replacements identified under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section will reasonably ensure the long-term
physical and social viability, including achieving structural/system soundness and full occupancy of the development
at a reasonable cost. For cost reasonableness, the IHA may choose to use the 90% of Total Development Cost (TDC) approach
(the preliminary estimate of hard costs for work proposed at the development is 90% or less of TDC) or a cost reasonableness
approach related to the cost of individual work items as indicated by National cost indices, adjusted by local conditions
and the IHA's own recent procurement experience. The IHA shall keep documentation in its files to support its reasonable
cost determinations of each major work item (e.g., kitchen cabinets, exterior doors). HUD will review cost reasonableness
as part of its review of the Annual Submission and the Performance and Evaluation Report. Where necessary, HUD will
review the IHA's documentation in support of its cost reasonableness;

Where an IHA's analysis of a development, under paragraph (d) of this section, establishes that completion of the
identified improvements and replacements will not result in the long-term physical and social viability of the development
at a reasonable cost, the IHA shall not expend CGP funds for the development, except for emergencies and essential
non-routine maintenance necessary to maintain habitability until residents can be relocated. The IHA shall specify
in its Comprehensive Plan the actions it proposes to take with respect to the non-viable development (e.g., demolition
or disposition under 24 CFR part 905, subpart M).

The Comprehensive Plan shall include a rolling Five-Year Action Plan to carry out the improvements and replacements
(or a portion thereof) identified under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. In developing its Five-Year
Action Plan, the IHA shall assume that the current year funding or formula amount will be available for each year of
its Five-Year Action Plan, whichever the IHA is using for planning purposes, plus the IHA's estimate of the funds that
will be available from other sources, such as State, local and tribal governments. All activities specified in an
IHA's Five-Year Action Plan are contingent upon the availability of funds;

After HUD approves the Comprehensive Plan (including the Five-Year Action Plan), or any amendments to the plan, it
shall be binding upon HUD and the IHA, until such time as the IHA submits, and HUD approves, an amendment to its plan.
The IHA is expected to undertake the work set forth in the Annual Statement. However, the IHA may undertake any of the
work identified in any of the other four years of the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan, current approved Annual
Statement or previously approved CIAP budgets, without further HUD approval. Actual uses of the funds are to be reflected
in the IHA annual Performance and Evaluation Report for each grant. See &sect;905.684. The IHA is encouraged to inform
the residents of significant changes (such as changes in scope of work or whenever it moves work items within the approved
Five-Year Action Plan). Documentation of that information shall be retained in IHA files. If HUD determines as a result
of an audit or monitoring findings that an IHA has provided false or substantially inaccurate data in its Comprehensive
Plan/Annual Submission or has circumvented the intent of the program, HUD may condition the receipt of assistance,
in accordance with &sect;950.687. Moreover, in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 1001, any individual or entity who knowingly
and willingly makes or uses a document or writing containing any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry,
in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States, shall be fined not more than
$10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.

The Annual Submission is a collective term for all documents which the IHA must submit to HUD for review and approval
before accessing the current FFY grant funds. Such documents include the Annual Statement, Work Statements for years
two through five of the Five-Year Action Plan, local government statement, IHA Board Resolution, materials demonstrating
the partnership process and any other documents as prescribed by HUD. For planning purposes, an IHA may use either
the amount of funding received in the current year or the actual formula amount provided in HUD's notification under
&sect;905.669(b)(1) in developing the Five-Year Action Plan for presentation at the resident meetings and public
hearing. Work Statements cover the second through the fifth years of the Five-Year Action Plan and set forth the major
work categories and costs by development or IHA-wide which the IHA intends to undertake in each year of years two through
five. In preparing these Work Statements, the IHA shall assume that the current FFY formula amount will be available
in each year of years two through five. The Work Statements for all five years will be at the same level of detail so that
the IHA may interchange work items as discussed in &sect;905.672(d)(5)(i). An IHA may budget up to 8% of its annual
grant in a contingency account for cost overruns.

Resident and local government participation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An IHA is required to develop its Annual Submission, including any proposed amendments to its Comprehensive Plan
as provided in &sect;905.672(e), in consultation with officials of the appropriate governing body (or, in the case
of an IHA with developments in multiple jurisdictions, in consultation with the CEO of each such jurisdiction or with
an advisory group representative of all jurisdictions) and with residents and duly elected resident organizations
of the developments covered by the Comprehensive Plan, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within a reasonable amount of time before the advance meeting for residents under paragraph (d)(2) of this section,
and the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the IHA shall annually provide public notice of the
advance meeting and the public hearing in a manner determined by the IHA and which ensures notice to all duly elected
resident organizations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Advance meeting with residents. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IHA shall at least annually hold a meeting open to all residents and duly elected resident organizations. The advance
meeting shall be held within a reasonable amount of time before the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
The IHA will provide residents with information concerning the contents of the IHA's Five-Year Action Plan (and any
proposed amendments to the IHA's Comprehensive Plan to be submitted with the Annual Submission) so that residents
can comment adequately at the public hearing on the contents of the Five-Year Action Plan and any proposed amendments
to the Comprehensive Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Public hearing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IHA shall annually hold at least one public hearing, and any appropriate number of additional hearings, to present
information on the Annual Submission and the status of prior approved programs. The public hearing shall provide
ample opportunity for residents of the developments covered by the Comprehensive Plan, officials of the appropriate
governing body, and other interested parties, to express their priorities and concerns. The IHA shall give full consideration
to the comments and concerns of residents, local government officials, and other interested parties in developing
its Five-Year Action Plan, or any amendments to its Comprehensive Plan.

Expedited scheduling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
IHAs are encouraged to hold the meeting with residents and duly elected resident organizations under paragraph (d)(2)
of this section, and the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section between July 1 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., after the end of the program year_June 30) and September 30, using the formula amount for the current FFY. If an IHA
elects to use such expedited scheduling, it must explain at the meeting with residents and duly elected resident organizations
and at the public hearing that the current FFY amount is not the actual grant amount for the subsequent year, but is rather
the amount used for planning purposes. It must also explain that the Five-Year Action Plan will be adjusted when HUD
provides notification of the actual formula amount, and explain which major work categories at which developments
may be added or deleted to adjust for the actual formula amount and that any added work categories/developments will
come from the Comprehensive Plan.

The Annual Statement for each year must include, for each development or on an IHA-wide basis for management improvements
or certain physical improvements for which work is to be funded out of that year's grant: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A list of development accounts with an identification of major work categories; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The cost for each major work category, as well as a summary of cost by development account; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The IHA-wide or development-specific management improvements to be undertaken during the year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For each development and for any management improvements not covered by a HUD-approved management improvement
plan, a schedule for the use of current year funds, including target dates for the obligation and expenditure of the
funds. In general, HUD expects that an IHA will obligate its current year's allocation of CGP funds (except for its
funded replacement reserves) within two years, and expend such funds within three years, of the date of HUD approval,
unless longer time-frames are approved by HUD due to the size of the grant, the complexity of the work, and other factors;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A summary description of the actions to be taken with non-CGP funds to meet physical and management improvement
needs which have been identified by the IHA in its needs assessments; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

General
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An Annual Submission accepted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall be considered to be approved,
unless HUD notifies the IHA in writing, postmarked within 75 calendar days of the date that HUD receives the Annual
Submission for review under paragraph (c) of this section, that HUD has disapproved the Annual Submission, indicating
the reasons for disapproval, the modifications required to make the Annual Submission approvable, and the date by
which such modifications must be received by HUD. HUD may request additional information (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for eligibility determinations) to facilitate review and approval of the Annual Submission during the 75-day review
period. HUD shall not disapprove an Annual Submission on the basis that the Department cannot complete its review
under this section within the 75-day deadline;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bases for disapproval for Annual Submission. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD shall approve the Annual Submission, except where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plainly inconsistent with Comprehensive Plan. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD determines that the activities and expenditures proposed in the Annual Submission are plainly inconsistent
with the IHA's approved Comprehensive Plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Contradiction of IHA resolution. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD has evidence which tends to challenge, in a substantial manner, the certifications contained in the board resolution,
as required by &sect;905.672(d)(7).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Amendments to Annual Statement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IHA shall advise HUD of all changes to the IHA's approved Annual Statement in its Performance and Evaluation Report
submitted under &sect;905.684. The IHA shall submit to HUD for prior approval any additional work categories (except
for emergency work) which are not within the IHA's approved Five-Year Action Plan.

Failure to obligate formula funds.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the IHA fails to obligate formula funds within the approved or extended time period, the IHA may be subject to an alternative
management strategy which may involve third-party oversight or administration of the modernization function.
HUD would only require such action after a corrective action order had been issued under &sect;905.687 and the IHA
failed to comply with the order. HUD could then require an alternative management strategy in a corrective action
order. An IHA may appeal in writing the corrective action order requiring an alternative management strategy within
30 calendar days of that order. HUD Headquarters shall render a written decision on an IHA's appeal within 30 calendar
days of the date of its receipt of the IHA's appeal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Extension of time for performance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An IHA may extend the target dates for fund obligation and expenditure in the approved Annual Statement whenever any
delay outside the IHA's control occurs, as specified by HUD, and the extension is made in a timely manner. Such revision
is subject to HUD review under &sect;905.687(a)(2) as to the IHA's continuing capacity. HUD shall not review as to
an IHA's continuing capacity any revisions to an IHA's Comprehensive Plan and related statements where the basis
for the revision is that HUD has not provided the amount of assistance set forth in the Annual Submission, or has not
provided such assistance in a timely manner.

(i) In making this determination, HUD will review the IHA's performance to determine whether the modernization activities
undertaken during the period under review conform substantially to the activities specified in the approved Five-Year
Action Plan. HUD will also review an IHA's progress against the implementation schedules for purposes of determining
whether the IHA has carried out its modernization activities in a timely manner;

(iii) In determining whether the IHA has made reasonable progress, HUD will take into account the level of funding

and expends such modernization funds within three years of ACC amendment execution, or such longer period if approved
by HUD or extended by the IHA for reasons outside of its control in an implementation schedule. The IHA must demonstrate
to HUD's satisfaction that any lack of timeliness (beyond the time periods specified in this paragraph or date specified
in a HUD approved implementation schedule) has resulted from factors beyond the IHA's control. If the IHA fails to
obligate formula funds within the approved or extended time period, the IHA may be subject to an alternative management
strategy which may involve third-party oversight or administration of the modernization function. HUD would only
require such action after a corrective action order had been issued under this section and the IHA failed to comply
with the order. HUD could then require an alternative management strategy in a correction action order. An IHA may
appeal in writing the corrective action order requiring an alternative management strategy within 30 calendar days
of that order. HUD Headquarters shall render a written decision on an IHA's appeal within 30 calendar days of the date
of its receipt of the IHA's appeal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Modernization work on a Turnkey III unit shall not increase the purchase price or amortization period of the home.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paid-off units.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Eligible modernization work on any Turnkey III units that have been paid-off, but not conveyed, by the time the CIAP
application or CGP Annual Statement is submitted, is limited to work which is necessary to meet statutory requirements
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 accessibility for disabled persons, lead-based paint testing, interim containment, professional risk assessment
and abatement). Such work must be completed prior to conveyance. Turnkey III units that have not been paid-off at the
time the CIAP application or CGP Annual Statement is submitted and for which work is included in the CIAP application
or CGP Annual Statement, are eligible for any physical improvements provided under &sect;968.310(d) even where
the units are subsequently paid-off before the work is completed, so long as the work is completed prior to conveyance.

Other.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The homebuyer family must be in compliance with its financial obligations under its homebuyer agreement in order
to be eligible for non-emergency physical improvements, with the exception of work necessary to meet statutory and
regulatory requirements, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 accessibility for disabled persons, lead-based paint testing, interim containment, professional risk assessment,
and abatement) and the correction of development deficiencies. Notwithstanding the above requirement, a PHA may,
with prior HUD approval, complete non-emergency physical improvements on any homeownership unit where the PHA demonstrates
that, due to economies of scale or geographic constraints, substantial cost savings may be realized by completing
all necessary work in a development at one time.

of this title, $75 million (which shall include unused reserve amounts carried over from previous FFYs), which shall
be made available to PHAs and IHAs for modernization needs resulting from natural and other disasters, and from emergencies.
HUD shall replenish this reserve at the beginning of each FFY so that it always begins with a $75 million balance. Any
unused funds from previous years will remain in the reserve until allocated. The requirements governing the reserve
for disasters and emergencies and the procedures by which a PHA may request such funds, are set forth in &sect;968.312.

. A PHA (including a PHA that has been designated as mod troubled under PHMAP) may obtain funds at any time, for any eligible
emergency work item as defined in &sect;968.305 (for PHAs participating in CGP) or for any eligible emergency work
item (described as emergency modernization in &sect;968.205) (for PHAs participating in CIAP), from the reserve
established under &sect;968.103(b). However, emergency reserve funds may not be provided to a PHA participating
in CGP that has the necessary funds available from any other source, including its annual formula allocation under
&sect;968.103 (e) and (f), other unobligated modernization funds, and its replacement reserves under &sect;968.310(a)(3).
A PHA is not required to have an approved comprehensive plan under &sect;968.320 before it can request emergency assistance
from this reserve. Emergency reserve funds may not be provided to a PHA participating in CIAP unless it does not have
the necessary funds available from any other source, including unobligated CIAP, and no CIAP modernization funding
is available from HUD for the remainder of the fiscal year.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The plan shall include, on a development-by-development basis, an analysis of whether completion of the improvements
and replacements identified under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section will reasonably ensure the long-term
physical and social viability, including achieving structural/system soundness and full occupancy, of the development
at a reasonable cost. For cost reasonableness, the PHA may choose to use the 90% of Total Development Cost (TDC) approach
(the preliminary estimate of hard costs for work proposed at the development is 90% or less of TDC) or a cost reasonableness
approach related to the cost of individual work items as indicated by National cost indices, adjusted by local conditions
and the PHA's own recent procurement experience. The PHA shall keep documentation in its files to support its reasonable
cost determinations of each major work item (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, kitchen cabinets, exterior doors). HUD will review cost reasonableness as part of its review of the Annual Submission
and the Performance and Evaluation Report. Where necessary, HUD will review the PHA's documentation in support of
its cost reasonableness;

 Where a PHA's analysis of a development, under paragraph (d) of this section, establishes that completion of the identified
improvements and replacements will not result in the long-term physical and social viability of the development
at a reasonable cost, the PHA shall not expend CGP funds for the development, except for emergencies and essential
non-routine maintenance necessary to maintain habitability until residents can be relocated. The PHA shall specify
in its Comprehensive Plan the actions it proposes to take with respect to the non-viable development (

its Five-Year Action Plan, whichever the PHA is using for planning purposes, plus the PHA's estimate of the funds that
will be available from other sources, such as State and local governments. All activities specified in an PHA's Five-Year

 After HUD approves the Comprehensive Plan (including the Five-Year Action Plan), or any amendments to the plan, it
shall be binding upon HUD and the PHA, until such time as the PHA submits, and HUD approves, an amendment to its plan.
The PHA is expected to undertake the work set forth in the Annual Statement. However, the PHA may undertake any of the
work identified in any of the other four years of the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan, current approved Annual
Statement or previously approved CIAP budgets, without further HUD approval. Actual uses of the funds are to be reflected
in the PHA annual Performance and Evaluation Report for each grant. See &sect;968.340. The PHA is encouraged to inform
the residents of significant changes (such as changes in scope of work or whenever it moves items within the approved
Five-Year Action Plan). Documentation of that information shall be retained in PHA files. If HUD determines as a result
of an audit or monitoring findings that a PHA has provided false or substantially inaccurate data in its Comprehensive
Plan/Annual Submission or has circumvented the intent of the program, HUD may condition the receipt of assistance,
in accordance with &sect;968.345. Moreover, in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 1001, any individual or entity who knowingly
and willingly makes or uses a document or writing containing any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry,
in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States, shall be fined not more than
$10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Annual Submission is a collective term for all documents which the PHA must submit to HUD for review and approval
before accessing the current FFY grant funds. Such documents include the Annual Statement, Work Statements for years
two through five of the Five-Year Action Plan, local government statement, PHA Board Resolution, materials demonstrating
the partnership process and any other documents as prescribed by HUD. For planning purposes, a PHA may use either the
amount of funding received in the current year or the actual formula amount provided in HUD's notification under &sect;968.315(b)(1)
in developing the Five-Year Action Plan for presentation at the resident meetings and public hearing. Work Statements
cover the second through the fifth years of the Five-Year Action Plan and set forth the major work categories and costs
by development or PHA-wide which the PHA intends to undertake in each year of years two through five. In preparing these
Work Statements, the PHA shall assume that the current FFY formula amount will be available in each year of years two
through five. The Work Statements for all five years will be at the same level of detail so that the PHA may interchange
work items as discussed in &sect;968.320(d)(5)(i). A PHA may budget up to 8% of its annual grant in a contingency account
for cost overruns.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After receiving HUD notification of the formula amount and estimating how much funding will be available from other
sources, such as State and local governments, and determining its activities and costs based on the current FFY formula
amount, the PHA shall submit its Annual Submission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Acceptance for review.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Upon receipt of an Annual Submission from a PHA, HUD shall determine whether:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Annual Submission contains each of the required components; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The PHA has submitted any additional information or assurances required as a result of HUD monitoring, findings
of inadequate PHA performance, audit findings, and civil rights compliance findings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the PHA has submitted a complete Annual Submission and all required information and assurances, HUD will accept
the submission for review, as of the date of receipt. If the PHA has not submitted all required material, HUD will promptly
notify the PHA that it has disapproved the submission, indicating the reasons for disapproval, the modifications
required to qualify the Annual Submission for HUD review, and the date by which such modifications must be received
by HUD.

Resident and local government participation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A PHA is required to develop its Annual Submission, including any proposed amendments to its Comprehensive Plan as
provided in &sect;968.320 (b) and (c), in consultation with officials of the appropriate governing body (or, in the
case of a PHA with developments in multiple jurisdictions, in consultation with the CEO of each such jurisdiction
or with an advisory group representative of all jurisdictions) and with residents and duly elected resident councils
of the developments covered by the Comprehensive Plan, as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Within a reasonable amount of time before the advance meeting for residents under paragraph (d)(2) of this section,
and the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the PHA shall annually provide public notice of the
advance meeting and the public hearing in a manner determined by the PHA and which ensures notice to all duly elected
resident councils;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Advance Meeting with residents.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PHA shall at least annually hold a meeting open to all residents and duly elected resident councils. The advance
meeting shall be held within a reasonable amount of time before the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
The PHA will provide residents with information concerning the contents of the PHA's Five-Year Action Plan (and any
proposed amendments to the PHA's Comprehensive Plan to be submitted with the Annual Submission) so that residents
can comment adequately at the public hearing on the contents of the Five-Year Action Plan and any proposed amendments
to the Comprehensive Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public hearing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PHA shall annually hold at least one public hearing, and any appropriate number of additional hearings, to present
information on the Annual Submission and the status of prior approved programs. The public hearing shall provide
ample opportunity for residents of the developments covered by the Comprehensive Plan, officials of the appropriate
governing body, and other interested parties, to express their priorities and concerns. The PHA shall give full consideration
to the comments and concerns of residents, local government officials, and other interested parties in developing
its Five-Year Action Plan, or any amendments to its Comprehensive Plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Expedited scheduling.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 PHAs are encouraged to hold the meeting with residents and duly elected resident councils under paragraph (d)(2)
of this section, and the public hearing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section between July 1 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 after the end of the program year_June 30) and September 30, using the formula amount for the current FFY. If a PHA elects
to use such expedited scheduling, it must explain at the meeting with residents and duly elected resident councils
and at the public hearing that the current FFY amount is not the actual grant amount for the subsequent year, but is rather
the amount used for planning purposes. It must also explain that the Five-Year Action Plan will be adjusted when HUD
provides notification of the actual formula amount, and explain which major work categories at which developments
may be added or deleted to adjust for the actual formula amount and that any added work categories/developments will
come from the Comprehensive Plan.

(4) For each development and for any management improvements not covered by a HUD-approved MOA or management improvement
plan, a schedule for the use of current year funds, including target dates for the obligation and expenditure of the
funds. In general, HUD expects that a PHA will obligate its current year's allocation of CGP funds (except for its funded
replacement reserves) within two years, and expend such funds within three years, of the date of HUD approval, unless
longer time-frames are approved by HUD due to the size of the grant, the complexity of the work, and other factors;

Submission for review under paragraph (c) of this section, that HUD has disapproved the Annual Submission, indicating
the reasons for disapproval, the modifications required to make the Annual Submission approvable, and the date by
which such modifications must be received by HUD. HUD may request additional information (e.g., for eligibility
determinations) to facilitate review and approval of the Annual Submission during the 75-day review period. HUD
shall not disapprove an Annual Submission on the basis that the Department cannot complete its review under this section
within the 75-day deadline;

The PHA shall advise HUD of all changes to the PHA's approved Annual Statement in its Performance and Evaluation Report
submitted under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;968.305. The PHA shall submit to HUD for prior approval any additional work categories (except for emergency
work) which are not within the PHA's approved Five-Year Action Plan.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Failure to obligate formula funds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the PHA fails to obligate formula funds within the approved or extended time period, the PHA may be subject to an alternative
management strategy which may involve third-party oversight or administration of the modernization function.
HUD would only require such action after a corrective action order had been issued under &sect;968.345 and the PHA
failed to comply with the order. HUD could then require an alternative management strategy in a corrective action
order. A PHA may appeal in writing the corrective action order requiring an alternative management strategy within
30 calendar days of that order. HUD Headquarters shall render a written decision on a PHA's appeal within 30 calendar
days of the date of its receipt of the PHA's appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Extension of time for performance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A PHA may extend the target dates for fund obligation and expenditure in the approved Annual Statement whenever any
delay outside the PHA's control occurs, as specified by HUD, and the extension is made in a timely manner. Such revision
is subject to HUD review under &sect;968.345(a)(2) as to the PHA's continuing capacity. HUD shall not review as to
a PHA's continuing capacity any revisions to a PHA's Comprehensive Plan and related statements where the basis for
the revision is that HUD has not provided the amount of assistance set forth in the Annual Submission, or has not provided
such assistance in a timely manner.

ACC Amendment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After HUD approval of each year's Annual Submission, HUD and the PHA shall enter into an ACC amendment to obtain modernization
funds. The ACC amendment shall require low-income use of housing for not less than 20 years from the date of the ACC amendment
(subject to sale of homeownership units in accordance with the terms of the ACC).

As HUD may require, the PHA shall execute and file for record a Declaration of Trust as provided under the ACC to protect
the rights and interests of HUD throughout the 20-year period during which the PHA is obligated to operate its developments
in accordance with the ACC, the Act, and HUD regulations and requirements.

(i) In making this determination, HUD will review the PHA's performance to determine whether the modernization activities
undertaken during the period under review conform substantially to the activities specified in the approved Five-Year
Action Plan. HUD will also review a PHA's progress against the implementation schedules for purposes of determining
whether the PHA has carried out its modernization activities in a timely manner; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) HUD will review a PHA's performance to determine whether the activities carried out comply with the requirements
of the Act, including the requirement that work carried out meets the modernization and energy conservation standards
in &sect;968.115, this part, and other applicable laws and regulations. This review should also include a review
of the PHA's section 3 (of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968) past performance.

by HUD or extended by the PHA for reasons outside of its control in an implementation schedule. The PHA must demonstrate
to HUD's satisfaction that any lack of timeliness (beyond the time periods specified in this paragraph or date specified
in a HUD approved implementation schedule) has resulted from factors beyond the PHA's control. If the PHA fails to
obligate formula funds within the approved or extended time period, the PHA may be subject to an alternative management
strategy which may involve third-party oversight or administration of the modernization function. HUD would only
require such action after a corrective action order had been issued under this section and the PHA failed to comply
with the order. HUD could then require an alternative management strategy in a corrective action order. A PHA may appeal
in writing the corrective action order requiring an alternative management strategy within 30 calendar days of that
order. HUD Headquarters shall render a written decision on a PHA's appeal within 30 calendar days of the date of its
receipt of the PHA's appeal.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule implements provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the Act) that require a $25
location fee and a $100 annual maintenance fee for each mining claim and site located and held under the general mining
laws. The fee requirements remain in effect through 1998, and apply to the assessment years 1994&hyph;95 through
1998&hyph;99. The final rule establishes the procedures for paying and administering the required annual maintenance
and location fees, puts into regulation the statute's mandatory payment deadlines and its mandatory provision that
failure to pay the fees on time constitutes abandonment of the claim or site, amends the recording and assessment work
regulations to conform to the requirements of the Act, and establishes procedures by which small miners may obtain
a waiver from payment of the maintenance fee. The final rule also implements the new location and recording requirements
for mining claims located on Stockraising Homestead Act lands. These requirements are contained in the Act of April
16, 1993 (107 Stat. 60). It also removes obsolete or expired provisions, and consolidates provisions that are still
in force and effect in the regulations concerning location and entry of mining claims and sites on coal bearing lands,
National Park System units, the King Range Conservation Area, and Indian reservations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposed rule amending certain sections of the regulations at 43 CFR parts 3720, 3730, 3800, 3810, 3820, 3830, and
3850 was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24572). There were 25 comments received regarding the proposal. Six comments were received from
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) State Offices, 4 comments were received from private attorneys, 3 comments were received
from individuals not connected with the mining industry, 3 comments were received from mining claimants, 3 comments
were received from mining industry organizations, 1 comment was received from an individual in a mining-related
business, 1 comment was received from a county government, 1 comment was received from an environmental group, 1 comment
was received from a mining company, 1 comment was received from a Forest Service employee, and 1 comment was received
from an individual BLM employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d), for good cause finds that it would not be in the public
interest to delay the effective date until 30 days after publication. The deadline for payment of the annual maintenance
fee is August 31, 1994. The mining industry needs as much time as possible to comply with the rule, and the BLM State Offices
will not be able to accept filing and payments, or to assist the public in other ways, until the rule is effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule contained several references to the Act of October 5, 1992, which established the mining claim rental
fee that has been in effect since the date of its enactment and which will expire on September 30, 1994. For the sake of
simplicity, and because (1) The maintenance fee essentially replaces the original rental fee, (2) the rental fee
statute will expire on September 30, and (3) any remaining issues regarding the rental fee can be dealt with using the
regulations that implemented the October 5, 1992, Act, which were codified in the 1993 Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR), all references to the 1992 Act have been removed from this final rule, including references to rental fees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments addressed all aspects of the proposed rule. They were all given careful consideration and are addressed
in this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether the $10 service charge for recording notices of location was being eliminated. The answer
is no, because it is required for cost recovery purposes. The service charge requirement is retained in &sect;3833.1&hyph;4(a).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment expressed uncertainty as to when the new maintenance fee was to be effective. The maintenance fee for existing
claims is first due to be filed on or before August 31, 1994, to hold the claim for the 1994&hyph;1995 assessment year.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that the maintenance fee should not be subject to increases tied to the consumer price index and
that such increases would put the fee out of sight for small miners. The comment further stated that these increases
should not apply to those holding 10 or fewer claims. The provision to adjust maintenance fees to reflect changes in
the consumer price index is statutory and cannot be changed in this rule. However, it would not affect small miners
who file a valid waiver certification statement. Such individuals would not have to pay the maintenance fee, but would
continue to perform $100 worth of assessment work as required by the Mining Law of 1872. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that this rule and other unspecified changes in the Mining Law were being done without congressional
authorization and are putting the mining industry out of business. The rule is being promulgated and is explicitly
required by Section 10106 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (107 Stat. 407), as enacted by Congress.
Despite the reduction in active mining claims on Federal lands since $100 fees were first required in the 1992&hyph;93
assessment year, there is no substantial evidence to suggest that the fee is driving the bona fide mining industry
out of business.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment objected to the short notice given in the proposed rule on May 11, 1994, that assessment work to hold the
claim for those claimants qualifying as small miners for the assessment year beginning on September 1, 1994, must
be completed in the assessment year ending on that date. However, enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act on August 10, 1993, predated the beginning of the assessment year ending on September 1, 1994, and served as ample
notice for those claimants seeking to qualify as small miners under the new legislation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment objected to any change in the Mining Law. Since the Congress has amended the Mining Law to require a maintenance
fee, no changes in the rule are warranted as a result of this comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments stated that references to the due date for payment of the initial maintenance fee, which is made at recordation
of the notice of location and within 90 days after location, were ambiguous. The comment identified the problem as
a possible conflict between the location date on the notice of location and the location date under State law. However,
pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 28, the date of the location of the mining claim is fixed under State law, and that is the date used
by BLM to determine the 90-day period under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) (43 U.S.C. 1701

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment from a county government stated that the removal of the requirement to file assessment work with BLM for
those who pay the maintenance fee will cause the same problems as those that occurred under the rental fee requirements
imposed by the Interior Department and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1993. The comment stated that because
the Federal requirement to record annual labor with BLM had been lifted, filings were not being made with county recorders,
affecting the record title history as well as State tax collections. Filings may still be required under State law.
If State law does not require filing with county recorders, then State law could be amended to remedy the problem. Also,
miners may risk losing their claims to third parties if they do not record with county recorders, and are urged to comply
with State and Federal mining laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that there was some confusion with the term ``record'' as used in the proposed rule. The comment
said that the term should be defined to apply only to county recordings and never to BLM ``filings.'' The term ``record''
has been used to refer to certain BLM filings for many years. Any reference to BLM recordation in the regulations clearly
refers only to BLM requirements for filings in the proper BLM office. It is inappropriate to provide for exclusive
application of the term to county recordings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that a notarized signature from each owner on a new notice of location should be required for State
and Federal tax purposes. The addition of this requirement would be of no value to BLM, because BLM is not the official
repository of mining claim ownership records. The States should ensure that their laws are adequate to trace ownership
for tax purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that the rule should require a notice of intention to hold to be filed in the local State jurisdiction
in certain circumstances. No such requirements can be added to this rule, because the 1993 Act does not impose a filing
requirement equivalent to the filing requirements in Section 314 of FLPMA. It is therefore up to the States to impose
such requirements as long as the 1993 Act remains in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that the rule should require that relinquishments contain notarized signatures of every owner
in order to protect all owners from having their interests voided without their consent. This is not necessary because
relinquishments relate only to the claimant making the relinquishment, and only his or her interest would be dropped,
not the interests of other claimants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that it is unclear who is required to submit changes of address to BLM and pay the service charges.
It is the owner's responsibility, not a lessee's. The owner is also referred to as the mining claimant. A transferee
could also be an owner or a claimant. However, while BLM does not adjudicate who pays the fee for a mining claim, it holds
the mining claimant responsible if the fee is not paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether the purpose for filing changes of address as requested in the rule is to help ensure that claimants
receive proper notice regarding their claims. The answer is yes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked why the rental fee is now called the maintenance fee. The October 1992 statute used the term rental
fee, and the August 1993 statute used the term maintenance fee. The second term more accurately reflects the nature
of the fee, since it is not considered rent, a service charge, or a tax. It is a payment required to maintain the mining
claim in good standing.

43 CFR 3833.0&hyph;3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment stated that it would not be proper to file a notice of intention to hold a mining claim pursuant to &sect;3833.0&hyph;3(a)
if a waiver is filed. This is true. The waiver for a mining claim can only be allowed if assessment work is done. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested a rewording of paragraph (g)(1)(i) for clarity. This modification has been made to make it clear
that it is the mining claimant who files the notice of intent to locate a claim.

One comment stated that paragraph (e), the definition of ``owner or claimant,'' should not require the name and address
of all owners on documents referred to in the subpart, but should only require the filer's name and address. This requirement
exists largely to protect each claimant's interest in being served in the event of an appeal or other need for communication.
Therefore, it will be retained.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments asked whether paragraph (m), the definition of ``file'' or ``filed,'' was intended to allow notices
of location or certificates of location to be subject to the postmark rule. The answer is yes, and the paragraph has
been further amended in the final rule to make it clear that, in addition, location notices and certificates of location
also will be accepted if postmarked by the end of the 90-day filing period. In response to a comment, the paragraph now
refers to the filing of a maintenance fee waiver certification statement rather than the filing of a maintenance fee
waiver: the former is a more accurate term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (m) was intended to allow $100 fee and waiver filings to be accepted if postmarked
by August 31 and received in the proper BLM office within 15 days of that date. The answer is yes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments said that new location notices should not be subject to the postmark rule pursuant to paragraph (m). All
other filings are similarly subject to the postmark rule. The comments give no reason for location notices to be treated
differently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment questioned whether BLM has the authority to extend the postmark rule to filings under the Act of August
10, 1993, since the Act specifically states that annual fee filings must be made by each August 31. The best precedent
for this is the longstanding administrative practice for annual filings under Section 314(a) of FLPMA. Section 314(a)
states that annual filings shall be made prior to December 31 yearly. However, the postmark rule has been applied to
these filings for years by regulation as a practical way of treating such filings received through the postal system,
and it has been upheld by the Interior Board of Land Appeals. The same practical consideration applies here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (m) is in conflict with &sect;1821.2&hyph;2(f), which does not recognize the
postmark rule except in certain instances. Section 1821.2&hyph;2(f) applies to the filing of applications only,
and paragraph (m) applies to filing notices of locations and payment of fees. No conflict exists between the two sections.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that paragraph (m) meant that if a claimant's maintenance fee filing was postmarked on August 16
or before that the claims would be forfeited. This is not true. The filing can be postmarked any time on or before August
31, as long as it is received in the proper BLM office no later than 15 days after August 31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (m) was meant to allow postmarks that fall on holidays and weekends. Deadlines
that fall on a day the BLM office is closed are carried over to the next working day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (m) was restricted to mailings postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service. This paragraph
has been amended to include other mail delivery systems that are independent of the claimant and for which the date
of filing with the system can be verified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (o)(1) is amended to state clearly that the FLPMA filing due on December 30, 1999, is the last FLPMA filing
affected by the Act of August 10, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (o)(2) is removed in the final rule because it duplicates &sect;3833.1&hyph;7(d). A comment received
concerning the wording of this paragraph is therefore moot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (o)(3) is removed because it duplicates &sect;3833.1&hyph;5(b) as it is revised in this final rule. Thus,
the concerns raised in two comments that referred to the conflicting wording of these sections have been addressed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the removal of paragraphs (o) (2) and (3), paragraph (o)(1) is merged into the introductory text of paragraph
(o). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (w) has been simplified to remove information provided elsewhere in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (bb) and (cc) are amended to reference &sect;3833.1&hyph;1, which is the final rule redesignation of
&sect;3833.1&hyph;8 of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested that paragraph (cc) should provide that refunds of payments made by credit card will be made
as a credit to the card account. This suggestion has been adopted in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

43 CFR 3833.1&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although it was not addressed in the proposed rule, the existing language of this section is removed in its entirety
and replaced with &sect;3833.1&hyph;8 of the proposed rule. The old section is being removed administratively in
this final rule because it deals with obsolete requirements. Because this amendment is an administrative action
to remove obsolete provisions, it has been determined that it has no impacts on the public. The Department of the Interior,
therefore, for good cause finds under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and 553(d)(3) that notice and public procedure thereon are
unnecessary and that this amendment may take effect upon publication.

In the proposed rule published on May 11, 1994, a paragraph (c) was added to &sect;3833.1&hyph;2 to establish a basic
process for compliance with Public Law 103&hyph;23 of April 16, 1993. This Act (107 Stat. 60) amended the Stockraising
Homestead Act of 1916 (43 U.S.C. 299) by establishing new mining claim location and surface operations requirements
for lands patented under the Stockraising Homestead with a reservation of the mineral estate to the United States.
The Act became effective on October 13, 1993. To implement the Act of April 16, 1993, the Department has begun formulating
regulations on locating claims and obtaining permission for exploration and mining on lands patented under the Stockraising
Homestead Act. These regulations will be proposed as additions to 43 CFR subpart 3814. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Departmental review demonstrates a need to have a basic location, recording, and notification procedure put into
place as soon as possible in order to avoid legal problems between surface owners, mining claimants, and the Department
over rights of location and entry on Stockraising Homestead lands under the Act of April 16, 1993. Therefore, as a logical
outgrowth of the language included in the proposed rule, a new paragraph (d) is added to section 3833.1&hyph;2 to explain
more fully the basic procedural requirements for locating and entering mining claims on Stockraising Homestead
Act lands. This language reiterates, to a large degree, the language of the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested that paragraph (c)(3) of the proposed rule be reworded for clarity. The final rule has been amended
to make it clear that mining claims located on lands patented under the Stockraising Homestead Act, as amended, will
not be recorded unless the claimant complies with the requirements in &sect;3833.1&hyph;2.

Paragraph (c)(3) has been removed because the information appears elsewhere in the section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments said that &sect;3833.1&hyph;3 was confusing. The statute establishes payment deadlines for some types
of fees, but allows payment deficiencies in other types of fee situations to be curable. The comments suggested that
this section be made uniformly curable or non-curable to promote ease of administration. This section was developed
in an effort to strike a balance among ease of administration, public service, and consistency with the law. Because
of the statutory nature of the maintenance fee, it is not possible to make nonpayment of that fee curable. The fact that
this deadline is firm is not an adequate basis for making other fee payment deficiencies non-curable.

One comment said that &sect;3833.1&hyph;3 ought to allow the claimant a chance to choose which mining claims should
have partial payments applied to them before BLM imposes its system for making this determination. This amendment
has been added in this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that the proposed rule was not clear about the treatment of insufficient maintenance fees paid for
new locations. The requirements for this situation are explained in paragraph (b)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that a phrase in paragraph (b)(2), which provides that new claims rejected for insufficient service
charges will be returned to the claimant/owner unprocessed, should be replaced by language requiring that a rejection
decision be sent after the claims are serialized (given BLM identification numbers). Claims for which service charges
have not been paid cannot be serialized because the missing or insufficient service charges are supposed to pay for
such processing. Therefore, absent service charges, there is no serialization, and thus no claims of record, and
there cannot be a formal decision on the disposition of the claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (b)(2) is too complicated and suggested that missing service charges be made a non-curable
defect. Making this change would not remove any administrative costs and would create the possibility of rigid and
unfair application. For instance, a claimant could file $250 to cover two claims, rather than the proper $270 (which
includes two $10 service charges, two $100 maintenance fees, and two $25 location fees). Under the scenario envisioned
in the comment, BLM would have to apply $135 to one claim and then have the expense of refunding $115 and returning the
second claim or writing a decision if the maintenance fee deadline had passed. The BLM prefers to apply the $250 to each
claim ($125 each), and call for the additional $20 in service charges to complete the recording process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to a comment, paragraph (b)(2) has been reworded to eliminate confusion as to which of two apparent deadlines
for paying a service charge applies. New paragraph (b)(3) has been added in the final rule to address the consequences
of partial payment of service charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked that the policy on treatment of payment of insufficient mandatory fees be clarified. (The comment
referred to the required $100 maintenance and $25 location fees.) This policy will not be put in the rule, but will be
included in the BLM Manual. When the payment submitted does not cover all of the fees due, the BLM will apply all fees
sequentially beginning with the first numbered claim of that claimant and to as many thereafter as the paid funds allow.
For instance, if a claimant submits $200 for two new locations, BLM would not consider this complete payment of maintenance
fees for two claims, leaving the location fees and service charges unpaid for both, but would apply the payment entirely
to the first claim before applying any money to the second. Thus, BLM would apply $125 ($100 for the maintenance fee
and $25 for the location fee) initially toward the first claim. Because the remaining $75 would be insufficient to
cover the mandatory fees on the second claim, the second claim would be voided for failure to pay the required fees.
A portion of the remaining funds would then be applied toward the first claim for the $10 service charge. If the claimant
submits other instructions on how to apply the fees, such instructions will be followed, if possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (c)(2) meant to allow a claimant to choose which claims or sites will be dropped
if the maintenance fee payment is not sufficient for all of their claims. The answer is yes. However, if the claimant
does not notify BLM of the preference, then BLM will apply the fees to those claims in ascending numerical order of serialization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested that cross references to &sect;&sect;3833.1&hyph;4 and 3833.1&hyph;5, provisions on service
charges and maintenance fees, be added in paragraph (c)(2). This did not seem necessary, in part due to the physical
proximity of the provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (c)(3) should be changed to remove the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* existing recorded
and serialized mining claims and sites*&blank;*&blank;*'' and to substitute the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* the
list of claims submitted by the claimant *&blank;*&blank;*.'' This change has not been made, but rather, the paragraph
has been removed from the final rule because it largely repeats provisions of paragraph (c)(2).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that the reference in paragraph (f) to facsimile authorizations may cause problems, because some
have been misdirected in the past. A misdirected facsimile would not be considered a filing in the proper office; no
filing or payment is complete or proper until it is received in the appropriate office.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The introduction to this section has been simplified to remove information that is provided elsewhere in the regulations.
The sentence referring to the application of paid rental fees to the maintenance fee was removed, because it confused
the two fees and erroneously applied the succeeding statutes. There is no possibility under either statute that the
rental fees covering 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94 could be applied to the maintenance fees covering assessment
years beginning with 1994&hyph;95. Also, the reference to &sect;3833.1&hyph;8 has been changed to &sect;3833.1&hyph;1
because of a redesignation in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h)(2)(i) is removed in the final rule because it contains information provided elsewhere in the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments questioned whether it was correct to say that the assessment years covered under the Act of August 10,
1993, end on September 1, 1999. It is correct because a maintenance fee paid on or before August 31, 1998, will hold the
claim through September 1, 1999. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment questioned whether this section allows claimants to have more than 10 claims waived. The answer is no.
The language clearly refers to &sect;3833.1&hyph;6, which explains that the waiver can apply only to those with 10
claims or fewer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that the reference in the first sentence of this section to &sect;3833.1&hyph;8 in the proposed rule
was incorrect because &sect;3833.1&hyph;8 did not make an exception from payment of the maintenance fee. This first
sentence refers to &sect;3833.1&hyph;8 in the proposed rule, redesignated as &sect;3833.1&hyph;1 in the final
rule, because the section referred to provides for refunds in certain cases. Therefore, the reference is necessary
because it shows that the maintenance fee is not always nonrefundable, not because the section referred to provides
for some exception to the payment requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether maintenance fees can be paid for years in the future despite the fact that assessment work
always has had to be performed annually. The answer is yes because the maintenance fee has only to be paid on or before
the August 31 deadlines, so that a claimant could pay $500 to hold a claim through September 1999. In the event, however,
that the fee is adjusted pursuant to Section 10105(c) of the Act, reconciliation payments or refunds may be necessary.
Assessment work requirements for small miners remain the same. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that paragraph (a)(1) was unclear in its reference to the ``time of recording.'' The final rule
has been amended to make it clear that this refers to filing with BLM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that it was incorrect for paragraph (a)(2) to allow no waiver for the initial claim maintenance fee
due upon recordation of a new claim. The small miner waiver is a discretionary waiver. A waiver of the initial maintenance
fee for small miners would be unnecessarily difficult to administer and impossible to apply equally to all miners.
Varying filing requirements arise when miners perform assessment work at different times during the assessment
year, and, in some instances, new locations could change the status of some small miners. As a matter of discretion,
therefore, BLM will not allow a waiver for the initial maintenance fee required upon location of a new claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments stated that paragraph (a)(1) does not account for the situation where the August 31 filing deadline
falls within a new location's 90-day recording period. Language similar to that in the rental fee regulations has
been added in paragraph (a) to cover this situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested that a requirement be added to paragraph (b) in which the claimant would indicate for which year
a submitted maintenance fee is intended. This extra requirement was not added because in almost all cases it will be
apparent which year the fee is intended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (g) should be removed because a small miner who transfers a claim has complied with
the Act, but would have to sell the claim for $100 less to a non-small miner transferee. The comment stated that this
would effectively take away the small miner's waiver. Such a result in claim transfer negotiations is not certain.
In addition, this provision cannot be changed because the statute is very explicit that a claimant who has more than
10 claims is required to pay the fee. The purchase price that is negotiated could be any amount decided by the two parties
and by no means has to reflect the maintenance fee to be paid by the non-small miner transferee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments addressing paragraph (g) asked what would happen if only a percentage of the interest in a claim subject
to a waiver, rather than the whole interest, was transferred to a party not entitled to a waiver. Because a response
to this question depends on whether the parties are related, a general answer cannot be given here. However, the paragraph
is amended to add the phrase ``or in part.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments asked what would happen if, unlike the situation described in paragraph (g), a waived mining claim was
transferred to someone who qualified for a waiver. In such a case the claim would be waived as long as the new owner still
qualified for the waiver with the addition of the new claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that the reference in paragraph (g) to the ``time of filing'' the transfer of interest should be
changed to the effective date under State law. This is correct and the amendment has been made in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that paragraph (g) should not allow payments after the applicable August 31 deadline in cases where
claims are transferred to an entity not entitled to a waiver, because there is no statutory authority for such extensions.
This is correct and the final rule has been amended accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (h) will cause claimants who had already paid under the old rate to have to make
additional partial payments. For purposes of clarification, paragraph (h)(2) has been amended in the final rule
to eliminate the possibility of second payments being required in any given year as a result of an increase. If payments
are made in advance of the year in which the fee is due, additional partial payments would be required if the fee is adjusted
upward for that year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that the public notice provided for in paragraph (h)(1) should be done by letter to each individual
miner. No decision has been made on how public notice under this paragraph will be accomplished, but it will be within
the guidelines of the Administrative Procedure Act, which controls all such methods of official notification, and
applicable case law.

One comment asked whether a possible upward adjustment of the maintenance fee per paragraph (h)(2) would mean that
the small miner would have to do assessment work of an increased value as well. The answer is no. The amount of assessment
work to be performed is established in the Mining Law of 1872. The maintenance fee is in lieu of assessment work required,
the value of which has not been amended. No further clarification is necessary in the regulations on this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment questioned some of the references in paragraph (i). This paragraph has been removed in the final rule,
because its contents are stated elsewhere in &sect;&sect;3833.1&hyph;5 and 3833.1&hyph;6.

Paragraph (a)(1) was amended to make it clear that for purposes of obtaining the small miner waiver, the claimant is
required to certify that he or she owns 10 claims or fewer on the date payment is due, which is August 31 of each year the
Act of August 10, 1993, remains in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments challenged this section of the proposed rule, correctly observing that the Secretary is not required
to offer a small miner waiver under the Act of August 10, 1993. One comment stated that the Secretary also had the choice
of not offering the waiver or offering some other kind, such as a one-claim waiver. The comment went on to ask about the
analysis that went into the decision to offer the 10-claim waiver and pointed out the administrative costs and loss
of revenue to the government in offering it (the other comment was also concerned with administrative costs). It further
asked what percentage of claims of record are owned by those with 10 or fewer claims. It also said that the National Performance
Review requested by the President states that the Government should get a fair return for Federal resources and the
waiver runs counter to this idea. There is nothing to suggest that Congress intended anything other than for the Secretary
to decide whether to offer the 10-claim waiver as outlined in the Act, or not to offer it at all. The statute allows the
Secretary discretion to offer the waiver to small miners, but defines small miners very specifically. Also, the Act
essentially extends the previous rental fee statute, which offered a similar 10-claim exemption. Therefore, no
other types of waivers such as a one-claim waiver were considered. The choice to offer the 10-claim waiver was made
primarily because the fact that Congress included the waiver in the legislation, although within the Secretary's
discretion, and included specific criteria for implementing it, suggests that Congress believed that allowing
the waiver is appropriate in certain circumstances, which the statute proceeds to lay out in detail. It is true that
there is an administrative cost and a loss of revenue to the Government because of the waiver. It was determined, however,
that these costs are justified. The decision to offer the waiver does not conflict with the National Performance Review,
because the Administration's position concerning a fair return for resources must be applied in light of the particular
facts involved, including other Administration positions, such as the policy of helping small business. Additionally,
it is the Administration's position that a royalty on production should be instituted in separate Mining Law reform
legislation, which would also apply to small miners. This is where the return for resources is more fairly applied.
Only approximately 10 percent of all active mining claims on Federal land are eligible to be excused from the maintenance
fee, so the vast majority of claims will be subject to maintenance fees paid by the claimants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that paragraph (a) should not allow mill and tunnel sites to be waived if listed on a small miner waiver
certification. Such sites will be eligible for waiver, because the Act of August 10, 1993, specifically allows a waiver
of the maintenance fee required for mining claims and mill or tunnel sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment objected to paragraph (a)(1), which allows a small miner to pay the fee as well as file for a waiver if so desired.
The comment stated that this is misleading because the fee is nonrefundable and the fee waiver would become moot. The
comment suggested that in such a case as this the fee should be refunded if a small miner waiver is found to be valid. The
purpose of this paragraph, which is similar to language which implemented the rental fee, is to make clear that there
is no penalty for both paying the fee and filing the waiver. The BLM has had a policy of not offering refunds in cases such
as this because of the significant costs associated with processing refunds, and because a decision to pay the fee
and file the waiver is entirely within the discretion of the claimant. It has been determined that such costs go beyond
basic public service and represent a burden on the taxpayer. However, the regulation provides at &sect;3833.1&hyph;1(d)
that in such a case the claimant could apply the payment to a subsequent year if the most current claim fee is waived through
the small miner certification process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments asked whether paragraph (a)(1) allows for claimants to pay the fee for some claims and get the waiver for
some if they have 10 or fewer total. The answer is no because the statute requires that if eligible claimants decide
to apply for the small miner waiver they must do so for all their claims. This paragraph does allow for a claimant to both
pay and file for a small miner waiver for all or some of his or her claims, but all of the claims count in deciding whether
the claimant is qualified for the small miner waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that paragraph (a)(1) should provide that if only one co-owner has more than 10 claims that only
his or her interest in the claims will be forfeited in the event of non-payment under &sect;3833.4. This depends on
the relationship between the parties. If the co-owners are not related parties as defined in the law and this rule,
the claim would be void as to the non-small miner co-owner only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding paragraph (a)(3) one comment asked how a claimant makes a certification for mill and tunnel sites when assessment
work is not required for sites. Simply listing sites on the small miner waiver form will act as a notice of intention
to hold and will suffice for certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3), a small miner who owned only mill or tunnel sites could get
a waiver. The answer is yes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (a)(3) should state that mill and tunnel sites are required to be active for the fee
to be waived. The maintenance fee is collected only in lieu of the assessment work requirement, 30 U.S.C. 28&hyph;28e.
No activity level is specified for mill sites in those sections of the Mining Law. Therefore, no such requirement has
been added to this rule. The validity of millsites may, nevertheless, still be challenged based on the requirements
in 30 U.S.C. 42.

One comment asked if paragraph (a)(3) meant that if mill sites are listed on a small miner certification, this would
constitute a filing of a notice of intention to hold. The answer is yes, and this is further clarified in &sect;3833.1&hyph;7(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (b) required that a reclamation plan be approved before the claimant can file
the certification statement, whether a closure date is required under the certification, and whether a statement
will have to be filed every year until closure. The comment also pointed out that notice-level reclamation work does
not need to be approved by the authorized officer. Another comment questioned the procedure to be followed on lands
where the surface is not managed by BLM. Unless only notice-level activities are being conducted on the mining claim,
a reclamation plan is required to be approved before a certification statement can be filed. This paragraph has been
amended to add ``in consultation with'' the authorized officer to cover notice-level operators who describe such
reclamation plans in their notice, but are not required to have them approved. Such reclamation plans, whether a part
of notice- or plan-level operations, are always required to be on file prior to any August 31 deadline. No closure date
is required as a part of the certification statement, and such statement will have to be filed every year until closure.
This paragraph also has been amended to clarify the process for claims for which the surface is not managed by BLM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments urged removal of paragraph (b), with one comment inquiring as to its statutory authority, its legal effect,
and the effect of failure to follow it. It further questioned whether this amounted to paying miners for doing what
they were already obligated to do under the law. Another comment questioned this paragraph as well. Section 10106
of the 1993 Act directs the Secretary to promulgate regulations implementing the maintenance and location fee requirements.
This authority is applied here to exempt from the maintenance fee claims being reclaimed after mining. A valid mining
claim need not be maintained in order for reclamation work to proceed. There is little incentive for claimants to maintain
claims in which the minerals have been exhausted. It is in the Department's interest to encourage claimants to retain
a mining claim until reclamation is complete. Excusing a miner from the maintenance fee during reclamation does not
in any way release the miner from the obligation to reclaim, which remains as before. Release of the bond serves as incentive
for reclamation. If the claimant is found to have filed a false certification, then appropriate action, including
penalties under 18 U.S.C 1001, may be instituted. Any failure to reclaim will be dealt with under applicable regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) has been amended to make it clear that an agency other than the National Park Service may deny access to
a claimant's mining claim. All such denials may be grounds for a waiver under this paragraph. A new subordinate paragraph
(3) has been added for the purpose of clarity to provide that the certification filed under paragraph (d) may serve
as notice of intention to hold under Section 314 of FLPMA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments stated that paragraph (e), dealing with deferments, is inconsistent with the maintenance fee statute,
which requires payment of the fee at specified times. One comment also stated that the fee cannot be deferred if, as
in the case of the non-small miner, no assessment work is required. The language in this paragraph is similar to language
in the rental fee regulations. The plain language of the Act of August 10, 1993, states that the fee is to be paid in lieu
of the assessment work when it is required. When the assessment work is deferred, the maintenance fee may also be deferred.
When a deferment ends, for the period in which the assessment work requirement was replaced by the maintenance fee,
the deferred maintenance fee must then be paid. One comment referred to this section as providing for granting a waiver,
but this is not correct. It provides for a deferment of fees that will have to be paid at the termination of the deferment.

, 128 IBLA 165. This decision found that only those claimants with 10 or fewer claims can obtain a deferment of assessment
work. That decision was based on the previous rule, implementing the rental fee requirements, which is being replaced
by this rule. It was not the intent of the Department to limit deferments to small miners in the last rule and it is not
the intent in this rule. Deferments under this paragraph may be obtained for any number of claims. The

One comment stated that paragraph (e)(1)(ii), redesignated (e)(2) in the final rule, departed from current policy.
This paragraph is basically the same as the paragraph that applied to deferments in the rental fee regulations. It
has never been the policy of BLM for claims to be automatically forfeited if a deferment is denied and the August 31 deadline
has passed. In the current regulations, as well as under this rule, a 30-day period from the receipt of a deferment petition
denial is allowed before payment of the fee is due. Spurious filings merely to delay payment of the fee have not been
and should not be a problem, because fee payment is only potentially delayed, but not excused, in the case of a deferment
denial.

One comment requested clarification of paragraph (e)(1). Under this paragraph it is possible for a small miner who
is exempt from payment of the $100 fee to have his or her assessment work deferred. A small miner who is also applying
for a deferment should certify as part of the waiver statement due on August 31 that assessment work that would otherwise
have been done within the subject assessment year will be done after the expiration of the deferment. This paragraph
has been amended in the final rule to make this requirement clear.

One comment asked whether a claimant who paid a rental fee by August 31, 1993, for the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year
must now do assessment work in the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year to obtain a waiver and hold the claim for the 1994&hyph;1995
assessment year, and certify to such by August 31, 1994, in order to qualify for a small-miner waiver. The answer is
yes, because if the requirement were interpreted otherwise, the one fee payment made in 1993 would hold the claim for
2 years rather than 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that BLM's fee waivers for small miners are not noted on the land records. The comment noted that
when the fee is paid, it is shown on the record, which therefore clearly shows good standing for the claim. It is true
that the BLM will not formally note acceptance of the waiver application on the land records. The BLM does not take formal
action to grant waivers, but anyone inspecting BLM records will see whether an abandoned and void decision was issued
and therefore whether a waiver application was rejected. It is also not true that a record showing a fee payment means
that the claim has definitely been deemed in good standing for another year. For instance, if the fee payment is by a
check that is returned unpaid by the bank, such payment will be judged to not have occurred and the claims will be declared
void if the payment deadline has already passed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) was amended to insert the word ``filing'' to make clear that what is described in the paragraph is a proper
certification filing. However, this does not mean that the claimant will automatically receive a waiver; the certification
filed is required to be consistent with the small miner's actual situation as of August 31, 1994, as determined by BLM.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments asked for clarification of paragraph (a). A valid exemption application having been filed by August
31, 1993, does not guarantee that the small miner's claim maintenance fee will be waived for the 1994&hyph;1995 assessment
year. This will only happen if all the same elements that existed in the 1993 filing exist on August 31, 1994, the most
obvious being the same number of mining claims. Otherwise the claimant will have to file a new waiver statement by August
31, 1994, or at least a supplemental statement. However, claimants whose situations have not changed since the 1993
filing need not file another certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) has been amended to make it clear that the assessment year beginning on September 1, 1994, is the year
for which a claim is held when the small miner certifies to assessment work done in the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year
by August 31, 1994. Also, a sentence repeating information existing in other sections has been removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(3) has been amended to make it clear that, for the purposes of obtaining the small miner waiver, the claimant
is required to certify that the assessment work has been performed or will be performed by the date the payment is due,
which is August 31 for each year the Act of August 10, 1993, is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment correctly observed that no waiver can be granted until after August 31 because the Act requires that the
small miner have 10 or fewer claims on that date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (a) was correct in allowing an exemption filed under the rental fee statute by
August 31, 1993, certifying that assessment work has been done in the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year, to constitute
a proper filing for the waiver statement due on August 31, 1994, under the maintenance fee statute. The answer is yes.
The rental fee statute required that claimants filing for the small miner exemption certify by August 31, 1993, that
they would perform $100 worth of assessment work during the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year. The maintenance fee
statute requires that claimants filing for the small miner waiver certify by August 31, 1994, that they have performed
the $100 worth of assessment work for the same 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year. Because in such a case the $100 worth
of work had already been certified to under the old law, it was determined that the new law did not require a doubling
of assessment work, but that the same $100 worth of work could be used. To require $200 worth of work in the same year would
be in conflict with the Mining Law of 1872, which requires only $100. This situation came about because the two laws
overlap for the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year as to the assessment work requirement for qualified small miners.
The old rental fee statute will expire in 1994, and there is no further overlap of laws. Therefore, a small miner who
qualified as such in 1993 need not take any action on August 31, 1994, if his or her situation has not changed since August
31, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested that pursuant to paragraph (a) claimants in this category should make filings by means of a new
``renewal'' form to be created. This would be more complicated than the process envisioned in this paragraph of the
proposed rule, because it would be duplicative. If a small miner could report no change from what was reported in the
exemption filing completed by August 31, 1993, then there is no purpose in requiring the miner to make any sort of new
filing by August 31, 1994, if he or she intends to obtain another waiver to hold the claim for the 1994&hyph;1995 assessment
year. Under the proposed rule the claimant would not have to make a new filing. However, the situation may have changed
since the claimant filed in 1993; for example, the claimant may now own seven claims instead of five. Such a claimant
would need to make a new filing by August 31, 1994, to reflect the changes. This could be done on the new waiver form, which
is not any more complicated than a ``renewal'' form would be. Because of this, a renewal form will not be created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments said that paragraph (a) needed clarification. The paragraph means that if a claimant properly filed
a certification by August 31, 1993, under the rental fee requirements, stating that he or she would perform the necessary
assessment work in the 1993&hyph;1994 assessment year to hold the claim for that same assessment year, and did subsequently
perform the assessment work, then he or she need not file a waiver statement by August 31, 1994. This does not mean that
the certification filed in 1993 automatically leads to a waiver to hold the claims for 1994&hyph;1995. The claimant's
1993 statement and BLM records as of August 31, 1994, would have to be found to support a waiver for one to be allowed.
For instance, if a claimant had added claims since the 1993 filing and had more than 10 claims on August 31, 1994, he or
she would not be granted a waiver on the basis of information submitted in 1993, which no longer accurately reflects
the status of the claimant. Such a claimant would have to pay the fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments stated that paragraph (c), which allows a waiver statement to serve as a notice of intention to hold, where
required, should specify the situation where such a filing is required. The primary case where this would apply would
be as to mill and tunnel sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated correctly that paragraph (c) should refer to obtaining the small miner waiver for the assessment
year ``beginning'' at noon on September 1, 1994, rather than ``ending.'' This correction has been made in this final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked about provisions for filing of a notice of intention to hold for mill sites and tunnel sites included
in a small miner waiver. These provisions can be found in paragraph (c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding paragraph (d) one comment asked whether each miner in a group or organization had to file a certification
statement. Each miner with an ownership interest in a claim is required to be identified and sign the certified statement
as provided in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5).

Two comments asked if the references in paragraph (d) to a ``certified statement'' means the statement is required
to be notarized. The answer is no, and the phrase ``certified statement'' has been changed to ``statement'' or ``waiver
certification,'' as appropriate to the context, in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (d) should require evidence of actual work on a claim such as proof of a Notice or Plan
of Operations as was required under the old rental fee statute. The requirement for a Plan or Notice was statutory under
the rental fee regulations, while the maintenance fee statute only calls for submission of proof of annual assessment.
Therefore, the Plan of Operations or Notice requirement was not included in this rule. The BLM will perform periodic
inspections of mining claims in order to make certain that work is being performed on mining claims for which fees are
waived. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether, pursuant to paragraph (d), a claimant who has one claim, and who is a member of a corporation
that has nine claims, other members of which have other claims, can receive the small miner waiver. The answer depends
upon whether the claimant is a ``related party'' to the corporation and other members of the corporation. A ``related
party'' is defined in the Act as one who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, another. The Act
goes on to provide that control includes actual control, legal control, and the power to exercise control, through
or by common directors, officers, stockholders, a voting trust, or a holding company or investment company, or any
other means. Whether a claimant is a related party for purposes of qualifying as a small miner will be determined on
a case-by-case basis. Because this question has been raised in a public comment, BLM will consider a subsequent proposed
rulemaking to provide interpretation of this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment correctly observed that, under paragraph (d)(2), a claimant could file for the small miner waiver before
August 31, and then relinquish any excess claims so as to have 10 or fewer claims by August 31, thereby meeting that requirement
for the waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (d)(5) should require notarization of signatures on the small miner waiver statement.
The reason given was that some claimants use fictitious names to increase acreage in association placer claims. Requiring
notarization would cause far more difficulty for all concerned, with little or no benefit. Meeting the notarization
requirement is especially inconvenient for multiple co-owners. In the event a claimant fraudulently inserts fictitious
names as in the example above, the claim would be open to attack from rival claimants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments requested a clarification of paragraph (e)(2). The Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act allows mining
claims held by persons on active military duty, or within 6 months of their release from active duty, or during or within
6 months after their release from any period of hospitalization due to military injuries, to be exempt from the assessment
work requirement. Likewise, such claims will be exempt from the maintenance fee requirement. The official notice
filed by a person that he or she has entered active duty in the military service should also include the scheduled date
of discharge. Military personnel would be subject to all assessment work or fee requirements 6 months following discharge,
unless proof of re-enlistment is submitted that includes a new discharge date. A person who has been on active duty
since before August 30, 1994, is required to file notice of such active duty status in the assessment year he or she wishes
the exemption to begin. Beginning September 1, 1994, any decision voiding a claim to which this exemption applies,
for nonpayment of the maintenance fee, will be vacated. This provision has been added to paragraph (e)(2) in the final
rule. Filing a notice of intention to hold is not necessary, because fee payments for mill and tunnel sites, for instance,
would merely be exempted in this case. As long as a qualified claimant follows the requirements of this paragraph,
the claim cannot be considered abandoned for failure to pay the maintenance fee. Section (e) has also been amended
to make it clear that, for a claimant to qualify under this section, he or she must own the claim without any unqualified
co-owners, and cannot be controlled by anyone who is unqualified under this section. Finally, for the purpose of clarity,
the order of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) in the proposed rule has been reversed in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that paragraph (f) should be removed because it would allow claimants who cannot perform assessment
work in National Parks, for example, also to avoid paying the maintenance fee. Because the assessment work restriction
within National Parks does not automatically signify that a claimant has been denied all access to his or her mining
claim(s), BLM has accepted this comment and paragraph (f) has been removed in the final rule. Claimants who hold mining
claims within National Parks and who would otherwise file a notice of intention to hold must pay the maintenance fee
to hold their claims unless they are denied all access to their mining claims by the National Park Service or they are
qualified as a small miner. Claimants who have been denied all access to their mining claims by the National Park Service
or other governmental agencies may seek relief from the maintenance fee under &sect;3833.1&hyph;6(d).

One comment asked if fees or charges should be returnable if the claims are still shown as active on BLM records but have
been voided or abandoned by operation of law, but for which a decision has not yet been issued. The answer is yes, if for
some reason payments are made on such claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments asked what the term ``docketed'' in paragraph (a) means. This word and other terms of art have been removed
and replaced with other terms to clarify the point at which service charges cannot be returned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked if service charges for amended locations will also be returnable under paragraph (b). The answer
is yes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment disagreed that paragraph (b) allows service charges to be returnable in such a case. Service charges must
be returnable in this case because the charges were paid for a service that will not be performed. For instance, if a
small miner submits the service charge with his or her annual assessment filing on a claim that is already abandoned
and void by operation of law, the service that the charges are for (to process the annual filing submitted) will never
be rendered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked whether paragraph (c) should refer to the time of ``submission'' of fees rather than the time ``fees
were paid.'' The term ``time of submission'' is more precise and the final rule has been amended accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (c) did not cover all instances for which fees may be refunded. This paragraph has been
amended to add overpayments as a reason for refund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked for a clarification of whether paragraph (d) means that BLM will only refund duplicate payments
when requested to. The answer is yes, but the final rule regarding this process has been amended to give the claimant
a choice between a refund or an application of the excess fees to a future year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that paragraph (d) should not apply to maintenance fees, but instead a new paragraph should be added
in which application of the duplicate fees to a future year would be automatic unless a refund is issued. This paragraph
has been amended to require that claimants who overpay their fee be given the choice either to receive a refund or to
apply the fees to a subsequent year. Claimants will be notified in every case, because they have a right to direct how
their overpayment is to be treated, and must know how much they have already contributed to the next year's payment
in order to adjust their payment for the next year.

One comment stated that the term ``mineral entry'' is inconsistent with terminology in 43 CFR 3851.5(a) and should
be changed to reflect this. It is inappropriate to make this change because the term is used in this section as it is in
43 CFR subpart 3851. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment challenged the statutory authority for this section. The comment stated that allowance of mineral entry
is only an early hurdle in the patent process, and a claim at that point remains unpatented and thus subject to the fee.
The comment also stated that associated regulations that allow assessment work to be excused in such a case are similarly
erroneous. There is no specific statutory authority for this section, but there are significant numbers of judicial
decisions supporting it. The end of the obligation to file proof of performance of assessment work is a part of the recognition
of mineral entry, which must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The similar treatment of the maintenance fee payment
is also a recognition of this mineral entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

One comment stated that paragraph (c) in the proposed rule is misleading because it refers to transfers of interest
``being effective'' on the date of recordation with BLM and also refers to ``BLM record title purposes,'' which it
said implies that BLM records reflect the true state of legal title for mining claims. This paragraph has been amended
in the final rule to make it clear that the recordation date of a transfer of interest is merely the effective date for
BLM record purposes. The paragraph is further amended by removing the phrase ``For BLM record title purposes'' to
eliminate this confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments asked for a clarification of paragraph (c). The paragraph means to say that a transfer is first officially
shown on BLM records as of the date of recordation with BLM. The actual effective date of the transfer is determined
by State law.

One comment said that paragraph (a)(3), which deals with failure to perform assessment work on or before the date of
the filing of a waiver statement, cannot result in forfeiture of the claim because this is not allowed under the Mining
Law. The comment further stated that retroactive forfeiture of a claim for failure to perform assessment work once
the waiver has already been granted should not be allowed. This paragraph is only referring to situations where a claimant
would file a false statement which says that assessment work had been performed when it had not. In such a case, upon
investigation, the claims would be declared void for failure to pay the maintenance fee, given that an invalid waiver
certification was filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

however, merely deals with determining who is the owner of a claim, not where he or she lives. Therefore, it does not
run afoul of the cited decision of IBLA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment stated that paragraph (a) should clearly state that the year referred to means assessment year. This amendment
has been made in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested that the phrase ``ownership records'' in paragraph (b) should be changed to ``BLM records''
to underscore that BLM is not the official repository of mining claim ownership records. The BLM does not consider
itself the keeper of the definitive record of ownership, and this paragraph in the proposed rule is not intended to
imply that it is. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment said that the phrase ``record title'' in paragraph (c) should be changed to ``BLM records'' in order to
avoid suggesting that the BLM ownership records are the official legal title records. The paragraph has been amended
to remove this misleading implication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal authors of this final rule are Frank Bruno and Roger Haskins of the Division of Solid Minerals, assisted
by the staff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management, BLM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this final rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The BLM has determined that this rule is categorically excluded
from further environmental review pursuant to 516 Departmental Manual, Chapter 2, Appendix 1, Item 1.10, and that
the rule will not significantly affect the 10 criteria for exceptions listed in 516 DM 2, Appendix 2. Pursuant to the
Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1508.4) and environmental policies and procedures of the Department
of the Interior, ``categorical exclusions'' means a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment and that have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted
by a Federal agency and for which neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also certifies that this document will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number
of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The fee may represent an economic consideration for a small, marginal operation that does not qualify for an exemption
under the rule. However, most small operations would qualify. A small entity that holds a valuable mining claim will
not be deterred by the annual fee, and many of them will qualify for an exemption. Most marginal claims were already
abandoned in 1993 upon promulgation of the regulations implementing the Act of October 5, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by Executive Order 12630, the Department of the Interior has determined that the rule would not cause a
taking of private property. The requirement that a modest fee be paid to hold or maintain an existing unpatented mining
claim, mill or tunnel site constitutes a reasonable regulatory burden, and it will have no effect on a claimant's use
of his or her claim or site as long as he or she complies with the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these regulations meet the applicable standards
provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions for collection of information contained at 43 CFR Parts 3730, 3820, 3830, and 3850, and subpart 3809
have previously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned clearance numbers 1004&hyph;0104,
1004&hyph;0110, and 1004&hyph;0114. Information collections for Parts 3730, 3820, 3830, and 3850 were consolidated
under clearance number 1004&hyph;0114 in the July 15, 1993, rule (58 FR 38186). As this rule removes obsolete or inoperative
sections of Title 43, Code of Federal Regulations, and extends the information collection-related effect of the
previously enacted Act of October 5, 1992, and implementing regulations published on July 15, 1993, this rule does
not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under
44 U.S.C. 3501

(e) Sections 10101&hyph;10106 of the Act of August 10, 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 405), require an annual
maintenance fee of $100 to be paid to the proper State Office of the Bureau of Land Management for each non-waived mining
claim, mill site, or tunnel site. With certain exceptions provided in &sect;3833.1&hyph;6, this fee is in lieu of
the requirement to perform and record annual assessment work under 30 U.S.C. 28&hyph;28e and section 314(a) of FLPMA.
Failure to pay the fee within the time limits prescribed by the Act of August 10, 1993, constitutes a statutory abandonment
and forfeiture of the non-waived mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site. Provisions relating to maintenance fees
and waivers are contained in &sect;&sect;3833.0&hyph;3(f), 3833.1&hyph;5, 3833.1&hyph;6, and 3833.1&hyph;7.

states that the maintenance fee provision shall not apply to any oil shale claims for which a fee is required to be paid
under Section 2511(e)(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The $550 fee requirement for oil shale claims remains in
effect. The $550 fee is first payable on or before December 31, 1993, and on or before each December 31st thereafter.

13, 1993, until a notice of intent to locate has been filed with the proper BLM State Office and the surface owner is notified
of the filing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1)(i) When a notice of intent to locate a mining claim has been properly filed by a mining claimant, no other person
may, until 90 days after the date the notice of intent is filed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) File such a notice with respect to any portions of the lands covered by the first notice; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Explore for minerals or locate a mining claim on any portion of such lands; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) File an application to acquire any interest in any portion of such lands pursuant to Section 209 of the Federal Land
Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1719). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The 90-day exclusive right may be extended by filing a Plan of Operations pursuant to subpart 3809 of this title.
The extension runs until the BLM has approved or denied the Plan of Operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The mining claimant may not locate mining claims on the lands encompassed by a notice under the Act of April 16, 1993,
until at least 30 days after he or she has properly notified the surface owner by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested.

 All service charges, maintenance fees, and location fees shall be payable by United States currency, postal money
order, or negotiable instrument payable in United States currency, and shall be made payable to the Department of
the Interior_Bureau of Land Management, or by a valid credit card acceptable to the Bureau of Land Management. A check
or negotiable instrument, including credit cards submitted for payment of charges and/or fees, for which payment
is not honored by the issuing authority, and such refusal is not an error of the issuing authority, will be deemed to
be a nonpayment of the charges or fees for which the check or negotiable instrument, including a credit card order,

accepted, and the submittal will be returned without further action by the authorized officer. The claimant may resubmit
the filings with the proper payment of service charges and fees within the same 90-day filing period referred to in
&sect;3833.1&hyph;2(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Failure to provide full payment of service charges set forth in &sect;3833.1&hyph;4 will be curable for new location
notices or certificates submitted for recording pursuant to &sect;3833.1&hyph;2 when the proper maintenance and
location fees have been submitted. Such documents will be noted as being recorded on the date received provided that
the claimant submits the proper service charge either within 30 days of receipt of a deficiency notice sent by the authorized
officer, or on or before the 90th day of the filing period referred to in 3833.1&hyph;2(a), whichever date is later.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the proper service charges have not been tendered pursuant to paragraph (b)(2), and if the claimant has not provided
written instructions regarding the application of the funds received with the original filing, the authorized officer

and filings made pursuant to &sect;&sect;3833.2 and 3833.3 and amended locations filed under &sect;3833.1. Such
documents and filings will be noted as being recorded on the date initially received, provided that the claimant submits
the proper service charge within 30 days of receipt of a deficiency notice from the authorized officer. Failure to
submit the proper service charge as required by this paragraph will cause filings made pursuant to &sect;&sect;3833.2
and 3833.3 and amended locations filed under &sect;3833.1 to be rejected and returned to the claimant/owner. If a
payment is received that partially covers the claims submitted, the payment shall be applied to mining claims and
sites in ascending numerical order of serialization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a claimant fails to submit the proper maintenance fees on or before each August 31, the authorized officer will
apply the fees received to existing recorded and serialized mining claims and sites in ascending numerical order
of serialization, unless otherwise directed by the claimant. The authorized officer will note the deficient fees
as being paid on the original date received, provided that the claimant submits the proper fees within 30 days of receipt
of a deficiency notice from the authorized officer, if that much time remains before August 31. If there are less than
30 days before August 31, the correct fees shall be filed (see &sect;3833.0&hyph;5(m)) by such claimant on or before
the August 31 deadline. Failure to submit the proper fees will cause the forfeiture of remaining claims or sites by
the claimant/owner.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) If a waived mining claim or site is transferred in total or in part to a party not qualified for a waiver, the waiver
is forfeited for the mining claim or site or portion of interest therein transferred to the unqualified party. The

&sect;3833.1&hyph;6 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Maintenance fee waiver qualifications under the Act of August 10, 1993, and other exceptions_applicable from 12
o'clock noon on September 1, 1993, until 12 o'clock noon September 1, 1999. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A small miner may, under certain conditions described in this section and in &sect;3833.1&hyph;7, perform the assessment
work required under 30 U.S.C. 28&hyph;28e and record it pursuant to Section 314(a) of FLPMA and &sect;3833.2 in lieu
of paying the maintenance fee. Assessment work shall conform to the requirements contained in subpart 3851 of this
title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) In order to qualify for a waiver of the maintenance fee requirements, a small miner shall meet all of the following
conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claimant and all related parties shall hold no more than 10 mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites, or any
combination thereof, on Federal lands in the United States on the date the payment is due, which is each August 31. For
purposes of determining the small miner waiver, oil shale claims shall not be counted toward the 10 claim limitation
for the small miner waiver of the $100 maintenance fee. A claimant who owns 10 or fewer claims, mill sites, and tunnel
sites, and otherwise meets the requirements of this section, is not precluded from paying the maintenance fee in addition
to filing for a small miner waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All mining claims and sites held by a claimant and all related parties shall be counted toward the 10 claim and site
limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Mill and tunnel sites of a qualified small miner, if listed upon the exemption certificate along with the affected
lode and placer mining claims, are waived from payment of the maintenance fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Mining claims and sites that are undergoing final reclamation, as approved by the authorized officer pursuant
to subparts 3802, 3809, or 3814 of this title, with no intent by the owner thereof to continue mining, milling, or processing
operations upon or under the mining claims or sites, are excused from payment of the maintenance fees. The owner shall
file a certified statement by August 31 in the proper BLM office attesting to the reclamation status of the affected
mining claims and/or sites, with reference to a reclamation plan approved by the authorized officer for plan-level
activities or submitted in consultation with the authorized officer for notice-level activities, and to his or her
intent to place them into permanent closure. If the surface is managed by an entity other than BLM, the claimant shall
submit evidence of a final reclamation plan that conforms to the requirements of the managing entity. A certified
statement of such intent and reclamation shall be filed pursuant to &sect;3833.1&hyph;7. The number of mining claims
or sites that may properly qualify for a reclamation waiver pursuant to this paragraph is not restricted to a 10-claim
limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Pursuant to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act (50 U.S.C. Appendix 565), military personnel on active duty
status may, under certain conditions, qualify for an exemption from the performance of assessment work and the payment
of maintenance fees. See &sect;&sect;3833.1&hyph;7(e)(2) and 3851.6 of this title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Under the following circumstances, a waiver may be obtained from the payment of the maintenance fee for mining
claims and sites: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The claimant has received a declaration of taking or a notice of intent to take from the National Park Service pursuant
to Sections 6 and 7 of the Act of September 28, 1976, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1905, 1906), or the Act of December 2, 1980,
as amended (16 U.S.C. 3192); or the claimant has otherwise been denied access by the United States to his/her mining
claims or sites.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The claimant shall file proof of the above conditions for exemption, attested to as a certified statement, pursuant
to &sect;3833.1&hyph;7, with the proper BLM office by the August 31 immediately preceding the assessment year for
which a waiver is sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The certified statement required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section, serves as a notice of intention to hold as
to mining claims and sites for which the exemption is sought. In such cases, the payment of the $5 service charge per
claim or site is due upon filing the certification statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Payment of the maintenance fee for mining claims covered by a deferment of assessment work granted by the authorized
officer pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 28 (b)&hyph;(e) and subpart 3852 of this title may be deferred during the period for which
the deferment is granted. Deferments are governed by the following rule. If a petition for a deferment of assessment
work, as required by &sect;3852.2 of this title, is filed with the proper BLM office on or before August 31 for a given
year, the maintenance fee need not be paid on the claims listed in the petition for deferment until the authorized officer
has acted upon the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the petition is granted, maintenance fees for the claims are deferred for the upcoming assessment year. At the
expiration of the deferment, all deferred fees shall be paid within 30 days of the end of the deferment, unless the claimant/owner
qualifies as a small miner. If the claimant/owner qualifies as a small miner, all deferred assessment work shall be
performed as provided in &sect;3852.5 of this title upon expiration of the deferment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the petition for deferment is denied by the authorized officer, the maintenance fees shall be paid within 30
days of receipt of the decision of the authorized officer denying the petition for deferment. Failure to pay the maintenance
fees owed will result in the forfeiture of the claims contained within the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) On mining claims for which an application for a mineral patent has been filed, and the mineral entry has been allowed,
the payment of the maintenance fee is excused for the assessment years during which assessment work is not required
pursuant to &sect;3851.5 of this title. However, no refund of previously deposited maintenance fees will be made
to the mineral patent applicant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) If no change in status has occurred, a small miner exemption certification previously filed for the assessment
year ending at noon on September 1, 1994, under the Act of October 5, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;381, 106 Stat. 1374), and
the pertinent regulations in effect on August 31, 1993, will be considered a proper certification filing for a waiver
of payment of the maintenance fee due on August 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The affidavit of assessment work performed by a small miner claiming a maintenance fee waiver shall be filed with
the proper BLM office pursuant to &sect;3833.2 and shall meet the requirements of &sect;3833.2&hyph;4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) For mining claims and sites covered by a waiver, the filing of a waiver certification pursuant to any of paragraphs
(a), (d), (e), or (f) of this section will satisfy the requirements for filing of a notice of intention to hold pursuant
to &sect;3833.2&hyph;5, when such notice of intention to hold is otherwise required. In such a case the payment of
the $5 service charge per claim/site for processing the notice of intention to hold is due upon filing of the waiver
statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In order to hold mining claims or sites for the assessment year beginning at 12 o'clock noon on September 1, 1994,
each small miner shall file a waiver certification on or before August 31, 1994. Each small miner shall file a waiver
certification on or before August 31 each year thereafter to hold the claims each assessment year beginning at 12 o'clock
noon on September 1 of the calendar year the certification is due, through August 31, 1998. The small miner shall document,
as provided in this paragraph (d), the claimed waiver for each assessment year a small miner's waiver is claimed, certified,
and attested to under penalty of 18 U.S.C. 1001. The statement shall contain: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The mining claim and site names and BLM serial numbers assigned to the mining claims and sites held by the small miner;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A declaration by the claimant and all related parties that they own no more than 10 mining claims and sites in total
nationwide on the date the waiver statement is due; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A declaration that specifies that the assessment work requirements have been or will be completed by the date the
payment is due, which is each August 31, for the assessment year just ending; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The names and addresses of all owners maintaining an interest in the mining claims and sites; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The signatures of all the owners of the mining claims and sites for which a waiver is claimed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Pursuant to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act, and &sect;3851.6 of this title, a military person entering
active service may file, or cause to be filed, in the proper BLM office, a notice of his or her entry into active military
service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The filing of the notice excuses the person from performing assessment work or paying the maintenance fees until
6 months have passed from the person's release from active duty status, or until 6 months have passed after release
from a military hospital, whichever is later. To be excused from paying the maintenance fee, the person cannot hold
the subject claim or site with a related party, as defined in paragraph 3833.0&hyph;5(y), who does not also qualify
under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The notice must be filed in the assessment year that the person entered active duty status, or if active duty began
prior to August 30, 1994, the notice must be filed in the assessment year that he or she wishes the benefits provided
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section to take effect. If the person previously filed a notice under the Soldiers' and
Sailors' Relief Act to be excused from performing assessment work, and remains qualified under that Act, he or she
will automatically be exempt from paying the maintenance fee.

given by publication in the newspaper published nearest the claim for at least once a week for 90 days. If, upon the expiration
of 90 days, after such notice in writing, or upon the expiration of 180 days after the first newspaper publication of
notice, the delinquent co-owner shall have failed to contribute the proportionate share of such expenditures or
improvements, such interest in the claim by law passes to the co-owners who have made the expenditures or improvements.

(2) Evidence of personal notice of delinquency upon the delinquent party. If notice is effected by mail, the minimum
sufficient evidence shall consist of a copy of the notice and a copy of the return receipt of the U.S. Postal Service
evidencing receipt by the delinquent party of a registered or certified envelope containing the notice. If notice
was made in person, an affidavit signed and dated on the date of notice will suffice as evidence of such notice; and

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the President's announcement on August 20, 1994, the Treasury Department is revoking the general authorizations
permitting cash remittances to Cuba, except to facilitate lawful immigration; revoking the general authorizations
for persons engaging in travel&hyph;related transactions in Cuba for purposes of family visits and professional
research; and significantly restricting the general authorization incorporating the authorization contained
in the General License GIFT, administered by the Department of Commerce, to limit the permissible contents of gift
parcels eligible for exportation to Cuba to medicine, food and strictly humanitarian items. Except for purposes
of facilitating lawful immigration, cash remittances to Cuba will only be permitted for limited humanitarian purposes
through case&hyph;by&hyph;case specific licensing. Charter flights between Miami and Havana will only be authorized
to carry legal immigrants, U.S and foreign government and international organization employees traveling on official
business, journalists, and persons traveling under specific license. Travel&hyph;related transactions by persons
demonstrating a compelling need to travel to Cuba for humanitarian reasons involving extreme hardship, for clearly
and narrowly defined educational and religious activities, for activities of recognized human rights organizations
investigating cases of human rights violations, or for activities related to professional research, telecommunications,
or the exportation, importation, or transmission of information or informational materials will be considered
for a specific license on a case&hyph;by&hyph;case basis.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 20, 1994, President Clinton announced steps to limit the ability of the Cuban government to accumulate foreign
exchange. Accordingly, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Cuban Assets Control Regulations,
31 CFR Part 515 (the ``Regulations''), to implement these measures by revising existing provisions that heretofore
have generally authorized travel&hyph;related transactions, cash remittances, and the shipment of gift parcels
to Cuba. Specifically, &sect;515.533 no longer authorizes exportation to Cuba of gift parcels pursuant to General
License GIFT, &sect;771.18 of the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Parts 768&hyph;799 (the ``EAR''),
except those containing only food, vitamins, seeds, medicines, medical supplies and devices, hospital supplies
and equipment, equipment for the handicapped, clothing, personal hygiene items, veterinary medicines and supplies,
fishing equipment and supplies, soap&hyph;making equipment, or certain radio equipment and batteries for such
equipment. The complete list of eligible items is set forth in &sect;771.18 of the EAR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 515.560 of the Regulations is revised to limit the categories of travelers to Cuba who are generally authorized
to engage in travel&hyph;related transactions to journalists and officials of the United States or foreign governments
or international organizations traveling on official business. ``Fully&hyph;hosted'' travelers are no longer
authorized to travel aboard charter flights between the United States and Cuba. Section 515.416 is revised to set
forth the criteria by which specific licenses may be issued for travel&hyph;related transactions for ``professional
research.'' Travel transactions by close relatives of Cuban nationals may only be authorized on a case&hyph;by&hyph;case
basis by specific license, and only under circumstances of extreme hardship. Specific licenses for travel&hyph;related
transactions may still be issued for other strictly humanitarian purposes, for clearly defined educational or religious
activities, for activities of recognized human rights organizations investigating human rights violations, or
for activities related to professional research, telecommunications, or the exportation, importation or transmission
of information or informational materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 515.563, which previously provided general authorization for family remittances for the support of close
relatives in Cuba, is revised to permit transfers of funds to Cuba only if authorized on a case&hyph;by&hyph;case
basis for humanitarian purposes upon a demonstration of extreme hardship. However, payments not exceeding $500
to facilitate a close relative's lawful immigration to the United States remain generally licensed. All other general
authorizations contained in the Regulations for remittances are revoked. In particular, &sect;515.564 is revised
to specify that remittances to Cuba for purposes of facilitating a Cuban national's travel to the United States for
purposes other than immigration may only be made pursuant to a specific license. Similarly prohibited are remittances
to Cuba in connection with intellectual property protection (&sect;515.528) and public performances (&sect;515.565).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

 Professional research and similar activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Section 515.560(b) sets forth the criteria by which specific licenses for transactions related to travel to,
from, and within Cuba may be issued for persons who are engaging in professional research and similar activities of
a noncommercial, academic nature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Persons are considered to be engaged in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional research
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for purposes of this section only if they are full&hyph;time professionals who travel to Cuba to do research in their
professional areas, their research is specifically related to Cuba and will constitute a full work schedule in Cuba,
and there is a substantial likelihood of public dissemination of the product of their research. No transactions related
to tourist or recreational travel within Cuba are authorized in connection with professional research, except those
that are consistent with a full schedule of research activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Similar activities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 include attendance by professionals with an established interest in Cuba at professional meetings where research
on Cuba is shared, and travel for noncommercial research purposes specifically related to Cuba by persons who are
working to qualify themselves academically as professionals (e.g., certain graduate degree candidates). Study
visits to Cuba in connection with pre&hyph;college or undergraduate college course work are not within the scope
of the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional research and similar activities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Categories of travel which do not qualify as professional research or similar activities and for which specific
license requests will be denied include recreational travel; tourist travel; travel in pursuit of a hobby; general
study tours; general orientation visits; student class field trips; youth camps; research for personal satisfaction
only; travel by fishing or bird&hyph;watching groups and similar affinity groups; and any travel for an authorized
research purpose, if the schedule of activities includes free time, travel, or recreation in excess of that consistent
with a full work schedule of professional research and similar activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A group does not fall within the scope of the term 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
professional research and similar activities
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 merely because some members of the group could qualify individually for specific licensing under this category.
For example, a specific license authorizing travel&hyph;related transactions by a fish biologist who travels to
Cuba to engage in professional research does not authorize other persons who might travel with the fish biologist
but whose principal purpose in travel is to engage in recreational or trophy fishing. The fact that such persons may
engage in certain activities with, or under the direction of, the professional fish biologist, such as measuring
or recording facts about their catch, does not bring these individuals' activities within the scope of professional
research and similar activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A person will not qualify as engaging in professional research or similar activities merely because that person
is a professional who plans to travel to Cuba. For example, a professor of history interested in traveling to Cuba for
the principal purpose of learning or practicing Spanish or attending general purpose lectures devoted to Cuban culture
and contemporary life would not qualify for a specific license. A doctoral candidate in economics traveling to Cuba
to undertake research for a dissertation on the Cuban economy may qualify for a specific license for activities directly
related to the research, but would not be authorized to stay an extra week in Cuba in order to attend a seminar on Cuban
arts and crafts.

of enabling the payee to emigrate from Cuba to the United States, including the purchase of airline tickets and payment
of visa fees or other travel&hyph;related fees. Such remittances may not exceed $500, and, except for purposes of
processing a letter of invitation or similar document on behalf of a Cuban national, may be transferred only after
the Cuban national has received a valid visa issued by the State Department or other approved U.S. immigration documentation.
Any amount remitted to Cuba directly or indirectly in conjunction with the processing of a letter of invitation or
similar document must be deducted from the $500 limit. Specific licenses may be issued to permit remittances by persons
subject to U.S. jurisdiction to Cuba or a Cuban national, directly or indirectly, for transactions to facilitate
non&hyph;immigrant travel by a Cuban national to the United States under circumstances where extreme humanitarian
need is demonstrated, including terminal illness or severe medical emergency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending &sect;771.18 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
to restrict exports to Cuba under General License GIFT to food, vitamins, seeds, medicines, medical supplies and
devices, hospital supplies and equipment, equipment for the handicapped, clothing, personal hygiene items, veterinary
medicines and supplies, fishing equipment and supplies, soap-making equipment, certain radio equipment, and batteries
for such equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commodities not eligible for export to Cuba under General License GIFT must be authorized either under the Humanitarian
License Procedure (&sect;773.5) or under an individual validated license. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action does not affect the continued general license eligibility of informational materials, as described
in General License GTDA (&sect;779.3) and Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 0A98I in the Commodity Control
List (CCL) (Supplement No. 1 to &sect;799.1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August 20, 1994, the President invoked the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act and continued in effect, to the extent permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA and
the EAR in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Savings Clause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Shipments of items removed from general license GIFT authorization as a result of this regulatory action may be exported
under the previous general license provisions up to and including September 13, 1994. Any such items 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not actually exported before midnight September 13, 1994, require a validated export license in accordance with
this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Rulemaking Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694&hyph;0005,
0694&hyph;0010 and 0694&hyph;0033.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has
to be or will be prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the
opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves
a military and foreign affairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed
rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on
this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Sharron Cook, Office of Technology
and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A watch or piece of jewelry is normally sent as a gift. However, multiple watches, either in one package or in subsequent
shipments, would not qualify for GIFT because the quantity exceeds that normally given between individuals. Similarly,
a sewing machine or bicycle, within the dollar limits of this general license, may be an appropriate gift. However,
subsequent shipments of the same item to the same donee would not be a gift normally given between individuals.

(C) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, clothing is appropriate, except that export of military
wearing apparel to Country Group Q, S, W, Y, or Z under this general license is specifically prohibited, regardless
of whether all distinctive U.S. military insignia, buttons, and other markings are removed.
