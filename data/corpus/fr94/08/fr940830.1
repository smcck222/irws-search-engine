SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan (Plan) to exempt from assessments producers
with less than 10 acres of watermelons rather than 5 acres and importers of less than 150,000 pounds, cover all 50 States
by the Plan, and revise the criteria for determining the eligibility of producers to serve on the Board. In addition,
conforming changes would be made to the rules and regulations issued under the Plan and the rules of practice for petitions.
Furthermore, the Department is announcing that a referendum will be conducted among eligible producers, handlers,
and importers to determine whether they favor the elimination of refunds of assessments and (2) whether they favor
the assessment of watermelon imports and the addition of importer members to the National Watermelon Promotion Board
(Board).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan [7 CFR 1210], hereinafter referred as the
Plan. The Plan is effective under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act, as amended by the Watermelon Research
and Promotion Improvement Act of 1993 [7 U.S.C. 4901&hyph;4916], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not
been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under &sect;1650
of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision
of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification
of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition.
After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the
United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date
of the entry of the ruling.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 750 watermelon handlers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5,000 watermelon producers in the contiguous 48 States of the United States who are subject to the Plan. There are approximately
140 importers of watermelons. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration
[13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5 million and small agricultural producers are defined
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of watermelon handlers, producers, and importers
may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes in the Plan, rules and regulations, and rules of practice for petitions reflect amendments to the Act.
The overall economic impact of these proposed changes is not expected to be significant. Including all 50 States and
the District of Columbia under the Plan will have little impact. The producer exemption from assessments would be
increased from 5 acres to 10 acres. This change would benefit small producers because it would increase the exemption
level, and small producers would not have to pay the assessment. The eligibility criteria for determining if a person
is a handler or a producer would not have any economic impact. The elimination of refunds may have some impact on a small
amount of producers and handlers who are currently entitled to refunds. There will also be a new burden on importers
caused by the assessment of imports, but importers are currently benefiting from the activities which promote watermelons
without paying assessments. The research and promotion program is expected to continue to benefit producers, handlers,
and importers subject to the Plan by expanding and maintaining new and existing markets. Accordingly, the Administrator
of AMS has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[40 U.S.C. chapter 35], the information collection requirements contained in the Plan have previously been approved
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0093. There would be a new reporting
burden on importers but the burden has been already approved by the OMB and assigned OMB control number 0581&hyph;0093.
This action adds no additional reporting burden. It has been estimated that it will take an average of 10 minutes for
each producer, handler, and importer of watermelons to participate in the voluntary referendum balloting.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Plan, the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) administers a nationally coordinated program of
research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen the watermelon's position in the market
place and to establish, maintain, and expand markets for domestic watermelons. This program is financed by assessments
on all producers, except those persons engaged in the growing of less than five acres of watermelons, and handlers
of watermelons. The Plan specifies that handlers are responsible for collecting and submitting both the producer
and handler assessments to the Board, reporting their handling of watermelons, and maintaining records necessary
to verify their reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. production of watermelons is estimated through the use of U.S. shipment statistics. Shipments of U.S.-produced
watermelons totaled about 1,895.6 million pounds in 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 percent less than in 1992. Imports of watermelons in 1993 totalled 343.5 million pounds, an increase of 12 percent.
Therefore, domestic production is about six times as great as the volume of imports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposed rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 14, 1994 [59 FR 17739]. The rule published in April contained the proposed amendments to the Plan, rules and
regulations, rules of practice for petitions, and referendum procedures. In order to have the referendum procedures
in place for the referendum, the Department decided to separately make final the referendum procedures. Therefore,
this proposed rule contains the proposed amendments to the Plan, rules and regulations, and rules of practice for
petitions. A final rule published separately in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contains the referendum procedures which will be used in the referendum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deadline for comments on the proposed amendments published on April 14 was May 16, 1994. Twenty-one comments were
received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighteen comments related to this proposed rule. Sixteen commentors stated their support of the proposed amendments
to the Plan. They stated that per capita consumption of watermelons is on the increase again and that the National Watermelon
Promotion Board (Board) has achieved many successes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commentors stated that they are not in favor of the Plan and that they were not aware that a refund provision was available.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A referendum was conducted in 1989 to determine if majority of watermelon growers and handlers favored the passage
of an industry funded research and promotion program for watermelons. The Plan is intended to collect assessments
for research and promotion of watermelons. Currently, any individual not favoring the program can request a refund
of the assessments paid by that individual. Procedures to request a refund of assessments are explained in the Plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the Act authorize an assessment on watermelons imported into the United States by importers, and
the addition of importer members to the Board if approved by watermelon producers, handlers, and importers in a referendum.
Watermelon imports enter the country primarily during the winter season. Imports of watermelons in 1993 totalled
343.5 million pounds. The assessment rate for imports would be the combined total assessment rate paid by producers
and handlers of domestic watermelons. The current assessment rate for producers is 2 cents per hundredweight and
for handlers is 2 cents per hundredweight. The combined assessment rate for importers, therefore, would be 4 cents
per hundredweight. Assessments will be paid at the time the watermelons enter the country. The collection of assessments
on imported watermelons will be expected to generate an additional $137,400 per year in revenue to the Board. In order
to make these changes, this rule will amend &sect;&sect;1210.305, 1210.320, 1210.321, 1210.328, 1210.341, 1210.350,
1210.351, 1210.352, 1210.363, and 1210.364 of the Plan; &sect;&sect;1210.402 and 1210.405 of the nomination procedures;
and &sect;&sect;1210.515, 1210.518, 1210.519, 1210.521, 1210.530, 1210.531, and 1210.532 of the rules and regulations.
In addition, a new &sect;1210.314 will be added to the Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the collection of assessments on imported watermelons, the Secretary proposes that the United States
Customs Service of the Department of the Treasury be designated as the collecting agency for assessments levied on
such imports. Other commodity research and promotion programs utilize the Customs Service as a means of collecting
assessments on imported products, and the Customs Service is agreeable to collecting these watermelon assessments.
An agreement between the USDA and the Customs Service would be entered into to implement this action. In order to make
this changes, this rule would amend &sect;1210.518 of the Rules and Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The importer representation on the Board would be proportionate to the percentage of assessments paid by importers
to the Board, except that at least one representative of importers would serve on the Board if importers are subject
to the Plan. This representation would enable importers to participate in developing the Board's programs, plans,
and projects, and express their views and concerns on how Board funds are used if imports are assessed under the Plan.
Importers would nominate individuals to serve as importer members on the Board, and as required for other members
of the Board, two nominees would be submitted to the Secretary for each vacancy. The Act requires the number of importers
members to be proportionate to the assessments paid by importers. However, it is necessary to calculate the number
of initial importer members on the volume of imports because imports are not currently being assessed. There are currently
14 producers and 14 handlers on the Board. This is the equivalent of one domestic industry member for every 67.7 million
pounds of domestic production. Based on the average annual volume of imports during the last 3-year period (323.1
hundredweight), four importers would be added to the current Board. In order to make this change, this rule would amend
&sect;&sect; 1210.320, 1210.321, and 1210.401. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides for the elimination of refunds of assessments if the producers, handlers, and importers vote to eliminate
refunds. The refund provision has been in effect since the beginning of the program. Refunds have been increasing
every year from 9 percent in 1990 to almost 29 percent in 1993. If the refund provision is eliminated, it would provide
the Board with an estimated additional $250,000 per year for research and promotion activities. In order to make this
change, this rule would amend &sect;&sect;1210.343 and 1210.520. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the refund provision remains in the Plan, and importers are subject to the Plan, then importers would be entitled
to a refund of all assessments paid on watermelons imported into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act increases the acreage for exempt producers from ``less than 5 acres'' to ``less than 10 acres'' of watermelons.
Importers of less than 150,000 pounds of watermelons per year would be entitled to apply for a refund which would be
the producer equivalent of the import assessments. The 150,000-pound exemption level for importers is the level
determined to be equivalent to 10 acres of watermelons for domestic producers. In addition, the Act provides that
the Board has the authority to establish rules for producers to certify whether they are exempt from the assessments.
In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;&sect;1210.341, 1210.342, 1210.518, and 1210.521. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also increases applicability of the law from the 48 contiguous States to the 50 States and the District of Columbia.
This amendment would expand the Plan to cover producers, handlers, and importers in Hawaii, Alaska, and the District
of Columbia. In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;1210.305 and would add a new &sect;1210.315.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1647(f) of the Act permits changes in the assessment rate through notice and comment rulemaking. No change
to the Plan is necessary to implement this amendment to the Act because &sect;1210.341 of the Plan states that assessment
rates shall be fixed by the Secretary in accordance with section 1647(f) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that a producer is eligible to serve on the Board as a representative of handlers (1) if a producer purchases
watermelons from other producers in a combined total volume that is equal to 25 percent or more of the producer's own
production or (2) if the combined total volume of watermelons handled by the producer from the producer's own production
and purchases from other producer's production is more than 50 percent of the producer's own production. This provision
facilitates the eligibility of producers and handlers to serve on the Board as representatives of their specific
group. In order to make these changes, this rule would amend &sect;&sect; 1210.321, 1210.363, 1210.368, and 1210.402.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also provides that all future promulgation and amendment referenda do not have to be conducted at Extension
Service county offices. This procedure proved to be expensive and difficult to administer. The Act would now allow
referenda to be conducted by mail ballot which would reduce the costs involved in conducting referenda and facilitate
a more timely tabulation of the results. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;1210.363. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Act changes the criteria for determining the outcome of referenda. The Act previously provided that
the Plan should not be effective unless approved by not less than two-thirds of the producers and handlers voting in
the referendum, or producers and handlers of not less than two-thirds of the watermelons produced and handled during
the representative period by producers and handlers voting in the referendum, and by not less than a majority of the
producers and a majority of the handlers voting in the referendum. The Act now specifies that the determination of
the results of a referendum should be on the basis of a simple majority of the producers, handlers, and, if covered by
the Plan, importers voting in the referendum. In order to make this change, this rule would amend &sect;1210.363.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, &sect;1210.252 would be revised to correct a wording error made during the promulgation of the Plan
and &sect;1210.322 would be revised to delete obsolete language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, &sect;1210.325 would be changed to reflect a change in the number of Board members that constitute a majority.
This revision would reflect the addition of importer members to the Board.

rather than quarterly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, miscellaneous conforming changes would be made to &sect;&sect;1210.251, 1210.302, 1210.328, 1210.340,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Small Business Administration (SBA) proposes to amend its regulations governing the Minority Small Business
and Capital Ownership Development program authorized by sections 7(j)(10) and 8(a) of the Small Business Act, 15
U.S.C. 636(j)(10), 637(a). This proposed rule would amend both eligibility requirements for and contractual assistance
provisions within the 8(a) program. Of particular note, this rule would recognize participation of Community Development
Corporations in the 8(a) program to an extent that would not be inconsistent with the requirements of the 8(a) program
as imposed by the Small Business Act, increase the personal net worth limitations for 8(a) applicants and Program
Participants to take into account inflation, eliminate the distinctions established in SBA's regulations concerning
``local'' and ``national buy'' 8(a) requirements, eliminate the restrictions on the number and dollar value of 8(a)
contracts received by Program Participants due to SBA-approved ``support levels'', and eliminate the distinction
for applying the competitive 8(a) requirements currently existing for indefinite quantity or indefinite delivery
requirements.

This proposed rule, if adopted in final form, would (1) make several clarifications of the eligibility requirements
for admission to SBA's 8(a) program, the need for which has been identified by SBA through the practical experience
gained in operating the program and in defending the agency's actions in 8(a) eligibility appeals brought before
SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), (2) authorize participation by business concerns owned by Community
Development Corporations in the 8(a) program in accord with 42 U.S.C. 9815, and (3) make several changes to the 8(a)
contractual assistance requirements, including eliminating 8(a) support levels and the concepts of local buy and
national buy 8(a) requirements.

This rule would clarify that 8(a) eligibility decisions are based on the facts before the Associate Administrator
for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development (AA/MSB&amp;COD) at the time of his/her eligibility
decision. The rule would specify that actual control of the applicant concern must be in the hands of one or more socially
and economically disadvantaged individuals at the time the appropriate district Certification and Eligibility
Branch (C &amp; E Branch) determines that an application for the 8(a) program is complete. Potential control or the
power of disadvantaged individuals to change the applicant concern's Board of Directors or other aspects of control
so that the applicant concern 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
could be
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 controlled by disadvantaged individuals, no matter how easily exercised, would not satisfy the requirement that
the applicant be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
actually
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 controlled by disadvantaged individuals at the time the SBA district office C &amp; E Branch determines an application
to be complete. One reason to require actual control at the time that an applicant applies for admission to the 8(a)
program is to prevent ``front companies'' from being admitted to the 8(a) program. It is SBA's view that this potential
for abuse would be greatly lessened by the clarifications made in this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Section 626(a)(2) of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97&hyph;35, codified at 42 U.S.C.
9815(a)(2), required ``regulations to ensure the availability to community development corporations of such programs
as shall further the purposes of this subchapter, including programs under section [8(a) of the Small Business Act].''
The purpose of the subchapter referred to in this provision ``is to encourage the development of special programs
by which the residents of urban and rural low-income areas may, through self-help and mobilization of the community
at large, with appropriate Federal assistance, improve the quality of their economic and social participation in
community life in such a way as to contribute to the elimination of poverty and the establishment of permanent economic
and social benefits.'' 42 U.S.C. 9801. SBA has not heretofore implemented this authority through regulations. This
proposed rule would recognize participation of Community Development Corporations (CDCs) in the 8(a) program to
an extent that would not be inconsistent with the requirements of the 8(a) program imposed by the Small Business Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA believes that only CDC-owned or financed small business concerns can be eligible for the 8(a) program, and not
the CDC itself. This position is consistent with the Agency's longstanding regulations implementing the Small Business
Act that a small business must be a for-profit business entity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 13 CFR 121.403. Since CDCs are non-profit entities, they could not be considered small business concerns within the
meaning of the size regulations and, hence, would not be eligible for the 8(a) program on that basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is not intended to imply in any way that the basic requirement of the Small Business Act that 8(a) concerns
be owned by disadvantaged individuals can be administratively changed. Presently, two statutory exceptions to
this ownership requirement have been implemented in regulations. Subclauses 8(a)(4)(A)(i)(II) and (III) of the
Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)(A)(i)(II) and (III), statutorily extend 8(a) program eligibility to small
business concerns which are owned by either an economically disadvantaged Indian tribe, or a wholly owned business
entity of such a tribe, or a Native Hawaiian organization. These provisions have been implemented in 13 CFR &sect;&sect;124.112
and 124.113, respectively. The authority for extending eligibility for the 8(a) program to CDC-owned entities is
also statutory. Thus, similar to SBA's treatment of tribally-owned concerns and concerns owned by Native Hawaiian
organizations, this proposed rule recognizes CDC-owned concerns in accord with the authority set forth in 42 U.S.C.
9815(a)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to this proposed rule, SBA would consider CDCs comparable to Indian tribes. A CDC could have an ownership
interest in several business enterprises, just like an Indian tribe under current regulations. Where statute and
implementing regulations authorize a tribally-owned business concern to participate in the 8(a) program, but not
the tribe acting on its own behalf, SBA proposes that similar treatment be afforded CDCs and CDC-owned business concerns.
SBA also believes that the regulatorily created exclusion from affiliation that has been afforded tribally-owned
business concerns (i.e., one tribally-owned business is not considered affiliated with the tribe or other businesses
owned by the tribe merely because of common tribal ownership) should be extended to CDC-owned business concerns as
well (this proposal would also make that exclusion available to concerns owned by Native Hawaiian Organizations).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order for any CDC-owned business to participate in the 8(a) program, SBA would apply the basic management and control
requirements imposed by the Small Business Act for 8(a) program participation. Thus, the proposed rule would require
that CDC-owned applicant concerns must be managed by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would also make changes, as needed, in various other eligibility and 8(a) contracting requirements.
These changes are identified below in the section by section analysis of this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Section By Section Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a section by section analysis of each provision of SBA's regulations that would be affected by this
proposed rule:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 121.906(b)(1)(iv) and 121.1106(b)(1)(iv) would be amended to permit a small business non-manufacturer
to supply other than a product made in the United States for a small business set-aside or 8(a) contract where the procuring
agency makes a non-availability determination pursuant to &sect;25.102(a)(4) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
There has been some confusion as to whether a non-manufacturer could qualify as a small business if there was such a
non-availability determination under the Buy American Act and the Federal Acquisition Regulation. SBA did not intend
to exclude non-manufacturers from small business set-aside and 8(a) contracts where such a non-availability determination
has been made. This clarification should clear up any ambiguity in this area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121.1104 would be amended to impose its provisions on competitive as well as sole source 8(a) contracting
opportunities. Heretofore, this regulation was inconsistent with competitive contracting procedures. Other
minor changes for purposes of improved clarity would also be made to this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121.1703(b) would be amended to clarify that only the AA/MSB&amp;COD can appeal a Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) code assigned by a procuring agency contracting officer to either a sole source or a competitive 8(a) requirement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
discussion relating to proposed &sect;124.307(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.100 would be amended by adding definitions of the terms ``CDC-owned concern'', ``Clear and convincing
evidence'', and ``Community Development Corporation or CDC''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``Unconditional ownership'' in &sect;124.100 would be amended to explain that a disadvantaged
owner may use his/her ownership interest (e.g., stock) in an applicant or 8(a) concern as collateral for financing
during the normal course of business without affecting his/her ``unconditional'' ownership in such concern, provided
that complete control of the ownership interest remains with the disadvantaged owner absent any default in fulfilling
the terms of the financing. However, events of default must be defined in commercially reasonable ways. Events of
default beyond those that are deemed commercially reasonable could lead to a conclusion that unconditional ownership
is not in the hands of the disadvantaged owner. This clarification is not intended to require a concern to obtain financing
through a financial institution or to preclude, for example, seller-financed transactions. It is intended only
to permit financing terms that are reasonable within the marketplace. This change is essential to ensure that applicant
and 8(a) concerns have the flexibility they need to raise necessary capital. The requirement that disadvantaged
owners ``unconditionally'' own and control an applicant or 8(a) concern should not restrict a firm's ability to raise
capital under normal commercial terms and conditions to assist it in becoming viable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would eliminate the definitions for ``local buy'' and ``national buy'' requirements from &sect;124.100.
All requirements other than construction requirements would be open to eligible 8(a) Participants nationally.
To the extent possible, SBA seeks to lift restrictions that are otherwise not imposed in procurements conducted other
than through the 8(a) program. This would result in all eligible 8(a) concerns nationally being able to submit offers
in response to competitive 8(a) solicitations. In addition, a Program Participant could market and seek sole source
8(a) requirements nationally. Construction requirements would be exempt from this change because section 8(a)(11)
of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(11), requires, ``to the maximum extent practicable,'' that 8(a) construction
contracts ``be awarded within the county or State where the work is to be performed.'' The proposed rule would make
necessary changes in &sect;124.308(d), &sect;124.308(f), revised &sect;124.311(d), (old &sect;124.311(e)),
revised &sect;124.311(e) (old &sect;124.311(f)), and revised &sect;124.311(f) (old &sect;124.311(h)) to eliminate
the local and national buy concepts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would make minor technical changes to &sect;&sect;124.101(a), 124.101(b), 124.102(a), 124.103,
124.104, and 124.109(d) to recognize that CDC-owned concerns would be eligible for participation in the 8(a) program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 124.101(a), 124.104 and 124.206(a) would be amended to clarify that the AA/MSB&amp;COD's decision to approve
or decline an application for 8(a) program participation would be based on whether the applicant concern complied
with each of SBA's eligibility criteria at the time the concern's completed application for admission to the 8(a)
program is sent to the Office of MSB&amp;COD for processing or, in the case of a request for reconsideration, at the
time the reconsideration application is deemed to be complete by SBA's Central Office. A change in circumstances
submitted by an applicant concern subsequent to the date that an application or reconsideration action is sent to
the Office of MSB&amp;COD for processing would not be considered, unless it causes a loss of eligibility. The structure
of the concern, including all necessary corporate formalities, would have to be in place prior to the Office of MSB&amp;COD's
processing of an application or request for reconsideration. A disadvantaged individual's ability to immediately
change the applicant's structure or effect a change in its control so that actual control of the concern is in the hands
of disadvantaged individuals and/or other eligibility criteria are met would not satisfy the requirement that they
be met at the time of the completed application. The rule would specify, however, that SBA, in its sole discretion,
could request clarification of information contained in the application at any stage in the application process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The decision of the AA/MSB&amp;COD to approve or decline an application for 8(a) program admission would then be based
on whether the application, as clarified by any information submitted in response to a request by SBA, demonstrates
that the applicant concern complies with each of SBA's eligibility criteria. While SBA would be able to request and
consider additional information in processing an 8(a) application, SBA would not consider information gratuitously
submitted by an applicant concern after it submits its application. This clarification is needed to streamline the
application process and ensure that SBA meets its statutorily imposed time limitation for processing applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.103 would be amended by adding a new paragraph (a) that would require direct ownership of 8(a) applicants
or Program Participants by disadvantaged 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
individuals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This statutory requirement is currently set forth in &sect;124.109, but SBA believes that it should be added to this
section for clarification purposes. Present &sect;&sect;124.103(a) through (j) would be redesignated to become
&sect;&sect;124.103(b) through (k). Sections 124.109(d) and (e) would be similarly amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newly redesignated &sect;124.103(i) (old &sect;124.103(h)) would be amended to permit a former Program Participant
to have an equity ownership interest of up to 20 percent in a current 8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business.
Such a requirement would increase an 8(a) concern's ability to raise capital, while continuing to advance the economic
viability of a former Program Participant after its 8(a) program term has expired. Section &sect;124.104(c)(2)
would also be amended to permit the principal of a former Program Participant to have an equity ownership interest
of up to 20 percent in a current 8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business as the former Program Participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newly redesignated &sect;124.103(j) (old &sect;124.103(i)) would be amended to make clear that an 8(a) concern
may substitute one disadvantaged individual for another without invoking the termination for convenience/waiver
provision of &sect;124.317 of these regulations with respect to any 8(a) contracts that it has been awarded on or after
June 1, 1989. Provided program eligibility is maintained and SBA approves a substitution of one disadvantaged individual
for another, performance of 8(a) contracts already received could continue without seeking a waiver under &sect;124.317.
SBA believes that the statutory termination for convenience/waiver provision did not intend to prohibit the performance
of an 8(a) contract by the 8(a) concern that initially received it simply where there has been one or more approved changes
of particular individuals upon whom eligibility of the concern was based. This change is necessary to apprise procuring
agencies and 8(a) concerns that termination of 8(a) contracts is not required in such instances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to proposed &sect;124.103(l), SBA would aggregate the ownership interests of a business concern and its
principal(s) in determining whether a non-disadvantaged individual or business concern exceeds the 10 percent
equity ownership limitations (or, in the case of a former Program Participant, the 20 percent equity ownership limitations)
established by &sect;&sect;124.103 and 124.104.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would also add a new &sect;124.103(m), dealing with the applicability of state community property
laws on the respective ownership interests in an applicant concern or a Program Participant once admitted to the Program.
This revision would not be a change in SBA policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.104(a) would be reorganized for greater clarity and easier use. Of particular note, &sect;124.104(a)
would be amended to specify that one or more disadvantaged individuals who are determined to manage the applicant
or 8(a) concern must be physically located at the offices of the applicant or 8(a) concern be open during the normal
40-hour work week of most business concerns. Thus, this proposed provision would require that the disadvantaged
individual(s) be present at the location of the applicant or 8(a) concern during those hours and not, for example,
only at night or on the weekends. This rule does not imply that business activities of the applicant or 8(a) concern
could not be conducted by such individual(s) outside the offices of the applicant or 8(a) concern, nor does it prohibit
a disadvantaged individual from establishing an 8(a) concern at his/her home. It is meant to ensure only that one or
more disadvantaged owners devote full-time to the business of the applicant or 8(a) concern. Under this proposed
amendment, SBA would not permit an individual to be physically located at a job which is separate and distinct from
the applicant or 8(a) concern during normal business hours and claim that he/she is managing the applicant or 8(a)
concern from that location.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.104(b) would be amended along the lines set forth above for &sect;&sect;124.101(a), 124,104 and 124.206(a).
This amended paragraph would specify that the Board of Directors must actually be controlled by disadvantaged individuals.
The power of a disadvantaged individual to control the Board of Directors indirectly through his/her right to vote
his/her stock (i.e., the power to remove and replace directors) would not be sufficient to establish control of the
Board of Directors if non-disadvantaged individuals on the Board of Directors could control, or assert negative
control on, the Board as currently structured at the time of the application for admission to the 8(a) program. This
paragraph would also provide that non-voting, advisory or honorary Directors may be appointed so long as they do not
possess negative control over the Board. Similarly, a separate board of advisors, particularly in the context of
tribally-owned applicants and 8(a) concerns, could be established provided such board of advisors could not actually
run the day-to-day operations of or possess negative control over the applicant or 8(a) business concern.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating whether an individual's social disadvantage has negatively impacted on his or her entry into and/or
advancement in the business world, &sect;124.105(c) would be amended to clarify that SBA will entertain any relevant
evidence, but that SBA would consider the experiences of the individual, where applicable, in education, employment
and business history. The failure to establish disadvantage in any one area (i.e., education, employment, or business
history) would not prevent an individual from meeting this requirement of negative impact as long as the totality
of the circumstances experienced by the individual demonstrate his/her disadvantage in entering into and/or advancing
in the business world.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.106(a)(2)(i) would be amended by increasing the entry level personal net worth limitation from $250,000
to $300,000 in order to take into account inflation. The $250,000 net worth figure was established by regulation in
April 1989. Inflation increased 19.6 percent between April 1989 and March 1994 based on the Consumer Price Index for
All Urban Consumers. Applying the 19.6 percent inflation rate to the $250,000 figure would increase the net worth
limitation to $299,000. This proposed rule would round that amount to $300,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.106(a)(2)(ii) would clarify SBA's method of analysis in determining whether the applicant concern
itself, as apart from its disadvantaged owner(s), should be considered economically disadvantaged. It would require
SBA to compare an applicant concern to other small business concerns in the same four-digit Standard Industrial Classification
Code which are not owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.106(a)(2)(i)(A)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) would be amended to provide that assets transferred by an individual claiming disadvantaged status to any immediate
family member within two years prior to the date of application to the 8(a) program shall be presumed to be the property
of the individual claiming disadvantaged status. Currently, property or assets transferred by an individual claiming
disadvantaged status to his/her spouse within two years of the date of 8(a) application is presumed to be the property
of the transferor for purposes of determining his/her economic disadvantage. SBA believes that a change is needed
to prevent circumvention of its eligibility regulations by asset transfers to other than an applicant individual's
spouse. Several applicants have avoided the intent of this regulation by transferring assets to children. SBA believes
that it is necessary to prevent the recurrence of this practice, which if left unchanged, could admit firms into the
8(a) program that SBA believes should be considered ineligible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.106(b) would be amended for clarity, and would increase the personal net worth limitation for the Small
Disadvantaged Business program from $750,000 to $900,000 to take into account inflation since the $750,000 standard
was set in April 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.107(b) would be amended to clarify that the requirement that an applicant concern possess technical
and managerial experience to be deemed to have the required potential for success to be admitted to the 8(a) program
was not meant to contradict the provision in &sect;124.104 that the individual(s) upon whom eligibility is based
need not posses both management and technical capabilities. In order to have the requisite potential for success,
an applicant concern must have both management and technical experience. Conversely, the individual(s) upon whom
eligibility is based must possess either management or technical capabilities to meet that part of the control requirement
under &sect;124.104.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.108 would be amended by adding a new paragraph (d)(3) that would state that any 8(a) applicant that is a
dealer or wholesaler would not be required to demonstrate that it is capable of supplying the product of a small business
manufacturer in conjunction with its 8(a) application. In the past, there has been confusion as to whether SBA's non-manufacturer
rule (i.e., the rule requiring a regular dealer to supply the product of a small business in order for it to be considered
small for a specific 8(a) or small business set aside procurement) should be applied in determining an applicant's
initial eligibility for the 8(a) program. SBA believes that because the Small Business Act authorizes waivers to
the non-manufacturer rule in connection with a specific contract where SBA determines that no small business manufacturer
can reasonably be expected to offer a product meeting the specifications of the solicitation, the non-manufacturer
rule should have no bearing on an applicant's eligibility for the 8(a) program. In addition, the 8(a) program should
not be viewed solely as a contracting program. There is other business development assistance available to Program
Participants which should not be foreclosed because of the non-manufacturer rule. Regular dealer applicants to
the 8(a) program should be aware, however, that they must generally meet the requirements of the non-manufacturer
rule in order to be awarded specific 8(a) contracts as regular dealers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;124.109(f) would add a provision making an applicant to the 8(a) program ineligible for program participation
if the proprietor, or a holder of at least 20 percent of the stock, or a partner, officer, director of the concern is currently
incarcerated, on parole or on probation. This provision is derived from a similar determination of ineligibility
for SBA financial assistance currently contained in 13 CFR 120.101&hyph;2(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.111 would be amended by revising paragraph (a)(2) to set the same personal net worth limitation for a Program
Participant in either the developmental or transitional stage of program participation to maintain its continued
8(a) eligibility. Currently, the limit is $500,000 for firms in the developmental stage of 8(a) program participation,
$750,000 for firms in the transitional stage of 8(a) program participation, and $750,000 for purposes of eligibility
for the Department of Defense's Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) program. This rule would eliminate the separate
net worth figure for firms in the developmental stage (i.e., eliminating the current $500,000 amount). It would then
apply the $750,000 amount, adjusted for inflation, to all participant firms to make the requirement for developmental
firms consistent with continued eligibility for transitional firms and simplify program administration. As with
the entry level personal net worth limitation amount, the $750,000 figure would also be increased by 19.6 percent
due to inflation (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 discussion relating to proposed &sect;124.106(a)(2)(i)). A straight inflation adjustment would produce a net
worth limitation of $897,000. This proposed rule would round that amount to $900,000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 124.111(c)(5) would be amended to further restrict excessive withdrawals from 8(a) Program Participants
by their owners or managers. Specifically, a Participant could no longer claim that large withdrawals from the Participant
should not be restricted where the concern's net worth has continued to increase throughout the period of time the
withdrawals are made. Certain Program Participants have attempted to claim that excessive withdrawals could not
be penalized where the Participant's net worth continued to increase because the withdrawals were not detrimental
to the attainment of its business plan. The 8(a) program is designed to foster the development of business concerns
owned by disadvantaged individuals. The fact that Participant's net worth has increased does not mean that it would
not have increased more or achieved greater success but for excessive withdrawals by its owners/managers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.112(c)(2)(iv) would be amended to clarify the requirements pertaining to a joint venture between an
8(a) concern owned by an Indian tribe and a concern determined to be other than small. There has been some concern that
this regulation required a majority of the performance of such a contract to be performed on an Indian reservation
or land owned by the tribe. This was not the intent. This proposed rule would amend this provision to make it consistent
with the same provision contained in &sect;124.321 which requires only that the tribally-owned 8(a) concern must
perform most of its activities generally on the reservation or tribally-owned land in order to be eligible to joint
venture with a large business. This provision contains no specific requirement that the work done through the joint
venture must be done on the Indian reservation or tribally-owned land. However, it is necessary not to overlook two
requirements which may perpetuate that requirement in some instances_that the concern must be located on the reservation
or tribally-owned land, and that the 8(a) participant to a joint venture must meet the performance of work requirements
imposed by &sect;124.314.

&sect;124.321(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.113 would be amended by adding an exclusion from affiliation for concerns owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization,
by prohibiting a Native Hawaiian Organization from owning more than one current or former 8(a) Participant having
the same primary industry classification, and by excluding from the one-time individual eligibility requirement
any individual who merely manages a concern owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would add a new &sect;124.114 which would specifically authorize CDC-owned small business concerns
to participate in the 8(a) program. The same amendments added to &sect;124.113 for Native Hawaiian Organizations
would be added to this section regarding CDC-owned concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minor clarifying language would be added to &sect;124.206(c)(1) regarding the time frame for an applicant concern
to request a reconsideration, and where such a request must be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 124.208(c) and 124.209(b) would be amended to streamline the procedures governing graduation and termination
of 8(a) Program Participants respectively. This rule would eliminate the second letter of notification and the second
45 day response period provided in &sect;124.208(c) and &sect;124.209(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, this rule would change the time period in which the Division Director must make a recommendation on
graduation to the AA/MSB&amp;COD. The rule would change the time frame for the Division Director's recommendation
to the AA/MSB&amp;COD from 15 days to 45 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.209(b) currently provides the same procedures and time limits regarding termination actions as are
discussed above with regard to graduation from the 8(a) program. This rule would make the same changes to the termination
procedures as are discussed above with regard to graduation from the 8(a) program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would amend the procedures concerning remands of 8(a) eligibility appeals by OHA to the AA/MSB&amp;COD.
Section 124.210(h)(2) would clarify that the AA/MSB&amp;COD would issue a decision in accordance with a remand order
of the Administrative Law Judge within 10 working days of the remand, unless the AA/MSB&amp;COD requests and the Administrative
Law Judge grants an extension thereof. An applicant or 8(a) concern could then appeal the AA/MSB&amp;COD's remand
decision to OHA within 20 working days of the date that the decision is mailed. The failure of an applicant to file an
appeal within the 20-day time frame would serve to make the remand decision the final agency decision and would not
require any further action by OHA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.210 would be further amended by adding a new paragraph (k) to specifically authorize reconsideration
of 8(a) eligibility appeal decisions made by SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals. Reconsideration would be specifically
authorized where a petitioning party establishes a clear error of law or fact affecting the decision in the case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.302 would be amended to ease the restrictions on adding SIC codes once a concern is admitted to the 8(a)
program. The proposed rule would permit SBA to approve an additional SIC code as long as a rational business explanation
exists for acquiring the requested SIC code. SBA seeks to make it clear that the authority to make decisions regarding
what types of business ventures an 8(a) concern should get involved in rests with the 8(a) concerns themselves. Thus,
for example, an 8(a) concern may acquire or develop the capability to perform contracts in an industry not directly
related to the 8(a) concern's primary business and seek to add the appropriate SIC code(s), or it may hire an additional
key employee that opens up new avenues of work to the 8(a) concern and seek to add additional SIC codes. In addition,
SBA proposes to shorten the time it takes SBA to respond to a request for a change in SIC code designations from 45 days
to 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would amend &sect;124.305(b)(3) regarding what a Program Participant must demonstrate to qualify
for an 8(a) bond exemption. As currently written, in order to qualify for a bond exemption, an 8(a) Program Participant
must, among other things, demonstrate that it cannot obtain a bond for the performance of the specific 8(a) requirement
at issued by submitting to SBA written denials from at least two sureties, one of which is a corporate surety and one
of which is an individual surety. Based on experience with this provision, SBA believes that the requirement that
two sureties decline to issue the required bond is unnecessary. As such, the proposed rule would amend &sect;124.305(b)(3)
to require a Participant to demonstrate only that it cannot obtain a bond from one corporate (Treasury-listed) surety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would revise &sect;124.305(c)(4) to provide that a Program Participant may be eligible to receive
only two bond exemptions at any one time. In other words, although up to five bond exemptions per Program Participant
are authorized, a Participant may not have more than two active 8(a) contracts at a time for which it has received a bond
exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would also eliminate the requirement that a Program Participant not be permitted to receive 8(a)
contracts in excess of its approved 8(a) support level. However, this would not affect SBA's authority to impose a
limit on the amount of 8(a) contract awards as a part of a remedial action plan where a firm fails to meet its competitive
business mix requirements. A concern would still be required to project in its business plan its anticipated level
of 8(a) contract support, but such level would be used only as a planning and development tool. Section 124.307 would
be amended by redesignating paragraph ``(d)'' as paragraph ``(e)'' and by adding a new paragraph ``(d)'' that would
eliminate approved 8(a) support levels as a basis for denying 8(a) contract awards in excess of those levels. SBA believes
that Program Participants should be afforded the flexibility to seek out and receive 8(a) contracts so long as they
are capable and responsible to perform those contracts and meet their competitive business mix requirements. SBA
would still determine whether a Participant was responsible to perform a particular 8(a) procurement requirement,
and could determine that the concern did not have the capacity to perform the extra work, but, except as part of an approved
remedial action plan, it could not withhold award merely because the concern would exceed (or has exceeded) its approved
support level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.307 would be further amended by adding a new paragraph ``(f)'' that would prohibit any party from challenging
the eligibility of a Program Participant for a specific sole source or competitive 8(a) requirement at SBA or any other
administrative forum. Much of this provision is currently contained in &sect;124.311(g) for competitive 8(a) requirements,
but no such specific language was set forth for sole source 8(a) requirements. The regulatory language appearing
in &sect;124.311(g) would be moved into this new provision and would be expanded to apply to sole source 8(a) procurements
as well. Section 124.311(g) would be removed as unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed rule would specify that only the AA/MSB&amp;COD could file a SIC code appeal in connection
with either a sole source or competitive 8(a) requirement. While this restriction appears in &sect;121.1703, as
part of SBA's size and SIC code appeal regulations, it was not similarly contained in the 8(a) regulations. SBA believes
that it should appear in both places for clarity and ease of use. It would specifically apply to both sole source and
competitive 8(a) requirements. SBA reviews every SIC code to determine its appropriateness, but so long as the code
assigned by the procuring agency contracting officer is reasonable, SBA will concur. SBA frequently goes back to
a procuring agency to dispute a SIC code when it feels that the statement of work indicates that the assigned SIC code
is inappropriate. Discussions between SBA and the procuring agency normally clear up any confusion. As part of this
process, any party may submit evidence to SBA to explain why it believes another SIC code should be assigned to the procurement.
SBA will consider such information and will seek a SIC code change if it believes that the SIC code assigned by the procuring
agency is unreasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.308(c) would be amended to specify where 8(a) offerings should be sent in light of the changes made by this
rule eliminating local and national buy requirements. Under the proposed rule, all requirements that are offered
to the 8(a) program as competitive procurements and those sole source requirements that are offered to the program
without nominating a specific Program Participant (i.e., open requirements) would be offered to SBA's Division
of Program Development in SBA's Central Office. Sole source requirements that are offered to the 8(a) program on behalf
of a specific Program Participant would be offered to the appropriate SBA district office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.308(d) would be amended to clarify the distinction between accepting a competitive 8(a) requirement
on behalf of the 8(a) program generally and a sole source 8(a) requirement on behalf of a particular 8(a) Program Participant.
In addition, the proposed rule would prohibit a procuring agency from conducting a competitive 8(a) requirement
prior to obtaining SBA's acceptance of the requirement for the 8(a) program. Any competition so held would not be considered
an 8(a) competition. If a procuring agency still wanted to fulfill its requirement through the 8(a) program, the requirement
would have to be offered to and accepted by SBA for the 8(a) program, and the procuring agency would have to use applicable
8(a) competitive procedures after the acceptance. The procuring agency would again be required to synopsize the
procurement in the Commerce Business Daily. A new solicitation would have to be issued, and new offers would have to
be submitted and evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.308 would also be amended, by adding a paragraph (d)(4), to permit all eligible 8(a) concerns nationally
to submit offers in connection with 8(a) competitive requirements other than construction requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 124.308(e)(1)(iii), 124.311(f)(4), 124.311(f)(5), 124.312(b), and 124.312(c) would be amended by removing
any provisions pertaining to 8(a) support level requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule would add a new &sect;124.308(i) pertaining to Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs). This provision would state
that each order to be issued under a BOA, and not the BOA itself, is a contracting action. As such, there must be a separate
offer and acceptance for each order. As with any other new offer, SBA would determine eligibility for an order under
a BOA at the time of the issuance of the order. This would require a concern to remain a small business at the time the order
is to be issued and would prohibit orders from being issued to concerns whose program terms have expired or who have
otherwise exited the 8(a) program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.309(c) would be amended to clarify SBA's intent regarding the concept of adverse impact. Under the proposed
rule, ``adverse impact'' could be found to exist where several requirements currently being performed by different
small business concerns are bundled into one larger requirement which could be considered ``new'' under SBA's regulations
due to the magnitude of the bundled requirement. This rule would permit SBA to find adverse impact in such a case where
at least one of the small business concerns losing work that is to be bundles meets the presumption of adverse impact.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule also proposes to amend &sect;124.311(a) concerning how the competitive threshold requirements should
be applied for indefinite quantity and indefinite delivery requirements. Currently, &sect;124.311(a)(2) specifies
that ``[f]or purposes of indefinite quantity/delivery contracts, the thresholds will be applied to the guaranteed
minimum value of the contract.'' This requirement has proven unworkable because of the immense differences noted
between the ``guaranteed minimum'' amounts on procurements offered to the 8(a) program and the maximum amounts authorized
under the procurements, and has been subject to substantial criticism. Procuring agencies can presently offer very
large procurement requirements to the 8(a) program as indefinite quantity type requirements with guaranteed minimum
amounts below the applicable 8(a) competitive threshold in order for contracts to be procured on a sole source basis,
even though the procurement would likely exceed the applicable competitive threshold during the performance of
the contract. Requirements that traditionally were procured through other contract types were being offered and
accepted into the 8(a) program as indefinite quantity requirements solely to take advantage of the guaranteed minimum
rule. In order to eliminate this potential abuse, SBA proposes to amend its regulations to specify that the competitive
threshold requirements would be applied for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 types of contracts, including indefinite quantity/delivery contracts, to the Government estimate of the requirement,
including options, as identified by the procuring agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would amend newly redesignated &sect;&sect;124.311(d), (f) and (g) (old &sect;&sect;124.311(e),
(h), and (i)) to take into account the proposed change made in &sect;124.308(d)(4) that would permit all eligible
Program Participants nationally to submit offers in response to 8(a) competitive solicitations, other than for
construction requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed redesignated &sect;124.311(g) (old &sect;124.311(i)) would clarify SBA's implementation of &sect;8(a)(1)(C)
of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(1)(C), which authorizes competitive 8(a) awards in limited circumstances
to firms which have completed their terms of participation in the 8(a) program. Of particular note, SBA would specify
in the regulations that eligibility would be determined as of the initial date specified for the receipt of offers
set forth in the solicitation without regard to extensions of time through amendments to the solicitation. The date
for determining eligibility would thus be firmly established and could not change during the procurement process.
With such a date certain, firms know up front if their program term will expire prior to that specified date. Offers
would not be prepared amid uncertainty that the date for determining eligibility could be changed. As such, firms
would not be dissuaded from participating in 8(a) competitive procurements during the later stages of their participation
terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.317 would be amended to specify that only physical or mental incapacity, and not criminal incarceration
or bankruptcy, could be a basis for a waiver of the termination for convenience requirement imposed by this section.
In addition, this section would be amended to make clear that the burden is on the concern requesting a waiver to specify
the ground(s) upon which the waiver is being sought and to demonstrate that it has met the ground(s). The Agency is not
expected to raise every possible basis for waiver and to then dismiss them as not applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would add a new &sect;124.319(c). This provision would clarify that SBA may novate one 8(a) Program
Participant for another (with the consent of the procuring agency) where the first concern cannot complete performance
of an 8(a) contract, without seeking the approval of the Administrator under &sect;124.317.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 124.321(a) would be amended to clarify that an 8(a) concern seeking to joint venture with another firm must
bring something of value to the joint venture arrangement other than its status as an 8(a) concern. While the regulation
would continue to state that a joint venture agreement is permissible only where an 8(a) concern lacks the necessary
capacity to perform the contract on its own, it would specify for the first time that where the 8(a) concern lacks the
management, technical 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
financial capacity to perform, a joint venture will not be approved. An 8(a) concern may be lacking in one or even two
of these areas, but cannot be totally reliant on its proposed joint venture partner. The purpose of permitting joint
ventures is to enable an 8(a) firm to gain experience and know-how so that it can become self-reliant in the future.
If all an 8(a) concern will gain from the relationship is a profit, without developing its own capabilities in any way,
the joint venture will not be approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;124.321(c)(3) would clarify that a joint venture can be made up of two or more 8(a) concerns without
any one firm receiving at least 51 percent of the net profits earned by the joint venture. In particular, a 50/50 joint
venture arrangement between two 8(a) concerns would be expressly authorized, provided the other regulatory requirements
were met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule would make minor clarification changes in &sect;124.321(d) to recognize the possibility of a joint venture
made up of two or more 8(a) concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed new &sect;124.321(i) would establish criteria relating to joint ventures for Small Disadvantaged Business
(SDB) set-asides and SDB evaluation preferences. In the past, SBA has held the position that SBA could not establish
eligibility criteria relating to joint ventures for the Department of Defense's SDB program. A recent decision by
the United States Court of Federal Claims held that ``the power to interpret the term small business concerns .&blank;.&blank;.
owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals [for purposes of DOD's SDB program]
is wholly and exclusively within the sphere of SBA's authority,'' and that ``SBA has both the power and the duty to define
the bounds of [that] phrase.''

No. 93&hyph;738 at 10, 11 (Fed.Cl. Feb. 18, 1994). This proposed rule attempts to implement that authority in a way
that is consistent with the purposes of the SDB program. While the rules vary somewhat from those pertaining to joint
ventures in the 8(a) program, the developmental purposes of the 8(a) program are not totally consistent with the purposes
of the SDB program. In addition, the rule applies the statutory requirement that the ``majority of the earnings of
[an SDB contract] directly accrue to [disadvantaged] individuals.'' Pub. L. 99&hyph;661, Sec. 1207(a)(1). Therefore,
although an 8(a) concern that is 51 percent owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals can joint venture with
a 100 percent nondisadvantaged concern for a particular 8(a) contract (provided the 8(a) joint venture requirements
are met), an SDB concern that is 51 percent owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals cannot joint venture
with a 100 percent nondisadvantaged concern for a particular SDB contract. In such a case, a majority of the earnings
of the SDB contract could not accrue directly to disadvantaged individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 124.501 would be amended by adding a new paragraph ``(c)'' and redesignating current paragraph ``(c)'' as

statements by 8(a) Program Participants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This rule is necessary to resolve several points relating to eligibility for SBA's Section 8(a) program and the procedures
relating to appeals of denials of eligibility. It would also clarify/amend the requirements by which an 8(a) concern
could obtain an exemption to the Miller Act bond requirements. The contracting opportunities offered to the 8(a)
program should not be affected by this proposed rule. Whether a particular 8(a) concern would be eligible for participation
in or, once in, could receive a bond exemption (and, therefore, whether it, as opposed to another 8(a) concern, would
be awarded a particular 8(a) contract) could be affected by the rule. The rule would have no effect, however, on the
amount or dollar value of any contract requirement or the number of such requirements reserved for the 8(a) program.
Therefore, it is not likely to have an annual economic effect of $100 million or more, result in a major increase in costs
or prices, or have a significant adverse effect on competition or the United States economy.

Section 8(a) self-certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) After SBA has notified a procuring agency in writing that it has accepted a requirement for the 8(a) program,
the 8(a) concern shall certify that it is a small business for the purpose of performing that particular contract (by
certifying that it is small with respect to the size standard corresponding to the SIC code assigned to the requirement)
at the time it submits its initial offer including price to the procuring agency for that contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Size certifications occurring prior to SBA's acceptance of a requirement for the 8(a) program shall have no effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Where a procuring agency conducts an 8(a) competition without first obtaining SBA's acceptance of the requirement
for the 8(a) program, any size certification made in response to the solicitation issued by the procuring agency shall
have no effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where a procuring agency negotiates directly with an 8(a) Program Participant for a sole source 8(a) requirement,
any size certification occurring prior to SBA's acceptance of the requirement for the 8(a) program shall have no effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Once a procuring agency has determined that award of a sole source or competitive contract should be made to a particular
8(a) Program Participant, SBA shall verify that the selected concern is small as of the date of its initial offer including
price.

(1) *&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) Where SBA verifies that the selected 8(a) concern is small for a particular procurement, changes in size subsequent
to the concern's self-certification (i.e., changes occurring between the date of certification and the date of award),
except those due to merger with or acquisition by another business concern, will not affect the concern's size status
as it relates to that procurement.

a sole source 8(a) requirement, may accept the procurement in support of another 8(a) concern, or may return the procurement
from the 8(a) program, as appropriate, or (2) in connection with a competitive 8(a) requirement, shall notify the
procuring agency of its determination and shall request that it select another apparent successful offeror.

 The 8(a) program: General eligibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In order to be eligible to participate in the 8(a) program, an applicant concern and an individual upon whom eligibility
is based must meet all of the eligibility criteria set forth in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109. An applicant
concern owned and controlled by an Indian tribe must meet the requirements set forth in &sect;124.112 and in &sect;&sect;124.102
through 124.109 as applicable. An applicant concern owned and controlled by a Native Hawaiian Organization must
meet the requirements set forth in &sect;124.113 and in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109 as applicable. An applicant
concern owned and controlled by a Community Development Corporation must meet the requirements set forth in &sect;124.114
and in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109 as applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An applicant concern's eligibility will be based on whether the concern meets each of SBA's eligibility criteria
at the time the concern's completed application for admission to the 8(a) program is sent to the Office of MSB&amp;COD
for processing or, in the case of a request for reconsideration, at the time the reconsideration application is deemed
to be complete by SBA's Central Office. SBA, in its sole discretion, may, however, request clarification of information
contained in the application or request for reconsideration at any time in the application process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) SBA will consider only additional information submitted by an applicant in response to an SBA request for clarification.
Changes in an applicant concern that SBA becomes aware of between the date of application (or request for reconsideration)
and the decision of the AA/MSB&amp;COD that adversely affect the applicant's eligibility for 8(a) program participation
will be considered and constitute grounds for decline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The decision of the AA/MSB&amp;COD to approve or decline an application for 8(a) program admission shall be based
on whether the application, as clarified by any information submitted in response to a request by SBA, demonstrates
that the applicant concern complies with each of SBA's eligibility criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All determinations made by the AA/MSB&amp;COD concerning the eligibility of an applicant concern for participation
in the 8(a) program shall be in writing, setting forth the findings based on relevant facts and in accordance with applicable
law and regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An applicant concern which is declined 8(a) program admission may request a reconsideration of such decline,
as set forth in &sect;124.206.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the application is declined on reconsideration based solely on a negative finding of social disadvantage,
economic disadvantage, ownership or control, such decline may be appealed by an unsuccessful applicant to the SBA's
Office of Hearings and Appeals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If no reconsideration is sought, or if after reconsideration the application is declined based in whole or in
part on a ground other than a negative finding of social disadvantage, economic disadvantage, ownership or control,
the written decline of the AA/MSB&amp;COD is final and not subject to appeal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The procedures by which an applicant concern may appeal the AA/MSB&amp;COD's denial of 8(a) program admission
to SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals, and the grounds for which such an appeal may be brought, are set forth in &sect;124.210
and part 134 of this title. Where such an appeal is brought, the written decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals
shall be the final Agency decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A concern which has been declined for 8(a) program admission must wait at least 12 months from the date of the final
Agency decision before it can reapply for program admission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In order to continue its participation in the 8(a) program, a Program Participant must continue to meet all eligibility
requirements described in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109, &sect;124.111(a), and &sect;124.112, &sect;124.113

concern as defined in part 121 of this title. The particular size standard to be applied will be based on the primary
industry classification of the applicant concern. The size of a tribally-owned concern, a concern owned by a Native
Hawaiian Organization, or a concern owned by a Community Development Corporation shall be additionally determined

Except for concerns owned by Indian tribes, Alaska Native Corporations, Native Hawaiian Organizations, or Community
Development Corporations, as defined in &sect;124.100, in order to be eligible to participate in the 8(a) program,
an applicant concern must be at least 51 percent unconditionally owned by an individual(s) who is a citizen of the United
States (specifically excluding permanent resident alien(s)) and who is determined by SBA to be socially and economically
disadvantaged. Special ownership requirements for concerns owned by Indian tribes and Alaska Native Corporations
are set forth in &sect;124.112. Ownership requirements for Native Hawaiian Organizations are set forth in &sect;124.113.
Ownership requirements for Community Development Corporations are set forth in &sect;124.114.

(g) The individuals determined to be disadvantaged in one 8(a) concern, their immediate family members residing

interest in any other single 8(a) concern.

(h) *&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A non-8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business is prohibited from having an equity ownership interest
in an 8(a) concern which exceeds 10 percent, except that a former Program Participant may have an equity ownership
interest of up to 20 percent in a current 8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business. *&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) *&blank;*&blank;* While SBA approval must be obtained, the substitution of one disadvantaged individual for

(l) The ownership interests of business concern and its principal(s) are considered to be aggregated in determining
whether a non-disadvantaged individual or business concern exceeds the 10 percent equity ownership limitations
(or, in the case of a former Program Participant, the 20 percent equity ownership limitations) established by this
section and &sect;124.104.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) In determining the respective ownership interests in an applicant concern, or in a Program Participant once admitted
to the program, SBA considers applicable state community property laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In a community property state, even when only one spouse's name appears on a document of title or stock certificate,
both spouses are considered to have one-half interest in that property as long as the property is acquired, earned,
or accumulated during the course of the marriage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If SBA determines that the stock or assets of an 8(a) applicant concern are held as community property, and if only
one spouse demonstrates disadvantaged status, SBA shall require as a condition of demonstrating or maintaining
eligibility, the transfer by the non-disadvantaged spouse or his/her ownership interest to the disadvantaged spouse.
Such a transfer must be in an amount sufficient for the disadvantaged spouse to meet the minimum 51% unconditional
ownership requirement for 8(a) program eligibility.

14. Section 124.104 would be amended by revising the introductory text, paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4), paragraph
(b), the introductory text of paragraph (c), paragraph (c)(2), and paragraph (d)(3) to read as follows:

Control and management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except for concerns owned by Indian tribes, Alaska Native Corporations, Native Hawaiian Organizations, or Community
Development Corporations, as defined in &sect;124.100, an applicant concern's management and daily business operations
must be conducted by an owner(s) of the applicant concern who has (have) been determined to be socially and economically
disadvantaged. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 &sect;124.112 for the requirements for tribally-owned entities and those owned by ANCs). In the case of an applicant
concern owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization, the concern's management and daily business operations must be
conducted by one or more Native Hawaiian individuals. In the case of a concern owned by a Community Development Corporation,
the concern's management and daily business operations must be conducted by one or more individuals determined to
be socially and economically disadvantaged. In order for a disadvantaged individual to be found to control the concern,
that individual must have managerial or technical experience and competency directly related to the primary industry
in which the applicant concern is seeking certification. The application must demonstrate that the applicant concern
is actually controlled and managed by one or more individuals determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged.
A disadvantaged individual's unexercised right to cause a change in the control or management of the applicant concern
does not satisfy this requirement, regardless of how quickly or easily the right could be exercised.

SBA will consider the experiences of the individual, where applicable, in education, employment and business history.
Failure to establish disadvantage in any one of these components will not prevent an individual from meeting this
requirement as long as the totality of the circumstances experienced by the individual demonstrates his/her disadvantage

Business financial condition.

This criterion will be used to provide a financial picture of a firm at a specific point in time in comparison to other
small concerns in the same business area which are not owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged
individuals. For purposes of this comparison, concerns in the same business area are those which are primarily engaged
in the same four-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code. SBA will rely on published data showing business
and financial profiles of similarly sized businesses operating within the same four-digit SIC code as the applicant,
except where such data is not reasonably available. In such a case SBA may rely on published data pertaining to small
business concerns in closely related four-digit SIC code(s) to derive the comparative profiles. In evaluating a
concern's financial condition, SBA's consideration will include, but not be limited to, the following information:
business assets, revenues, pre-tax profit, working capital, and net worth of the concern (including the value of
the investments in the concern held by the individual claiming disadvantaged status).

set-asides, Small Disadvantaged Business Evaluation preferences, and other programs requiring SBA's determination
of disadvantaged status, SBA will consider the same information and factors set forth in paragraph (a) of this section,
but will apply standards to each factor that are less restrictive than those applied when determining economic disadvantage
for purposes of the 8(a) program. This approach reflects the Congressional intent that partial or complete achievement
of a concern's 8(a) program business development goals should not necessarily preclude its participation in other
Federal procurement programs for concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

(b) In determining whether a concern has the requisite potential for success to be admitted into the 8(a) program,
SBA will look at a number of factors including, but not limited to, the technical and managerial experience and competency
of the applicant concern's managers and of the concern as a whole, the financial capacity of the applicant concern
and the concern's record of performance on previous Federal and private sector contracts in the primary industry
in which the concern is seeking 8(a) certification. While the individual(s) upon whom eligibility is based need not
possess both management and technical capabilities pursuant to &sect;124.104, the applicant concern as a whole
must demonstrate both technical know-how in the primary industry in which the concern is seeking 8(a) certification
and management experience sufficient to run its day-to-day operations. SBA will examine each of these factors to
determine whether an otherwise eligible applicant concern has the potential to successfully perform subcontracts
awarded under the 8(a) program and to meet the business development objectives and goals of the program.

A non-profit organization does not meet the general definition of a concern as set forth in part 121 and &sect;124.100

an appropriate reinvestment of funds or other assets and such other actions as SBA may deem necessary to counteract
the detrimental withdrawals as a condition of maintaining 8(a) program eligibility. The mere fact that a concern's
net worth has increased despite withdrawals that are deemed excessive will not preclude SBA from determining that
such withdrawals were detrimental to the attainment of the concern's business objectives or to its overall business

 All requirements that are offered to the 8(a) program as competitive procurements and those sole source requirements
that are offered to the program without nominating a specific Program Participant (i.e., open requirements) should
be offered to SBA's Division of Program Development, 409 Third Street SW., Washington, DC 20416. Sole source requirements
that are offered to the 8(a) program on behalf of a specific Program Participant should be offered to the appropriate
SBA district office. When a requirement is offered to the 8(a) program, the offering letter or notification from the
procuring agency shall contain the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Acceptance of the requirement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Upon receipt of the procuring agency's offer of a procurement requirement, SBA will determine whether it will accept
the requirement for the 8(a) program. SBA's decision whether to accept the requirement will be transmitted to the
procuring agency in writing within 15 working days of receipt of the written offering letter, unless SBA requests,
and the procuring agency grants, an extension. SBA is not required to accept any particular procurement offered to
the 8(a) program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Where SBA decides to accept an offering of a sole source 8(a) procurement, SBa will accept the offer both on behalf
of the program and in support of the approved business plan of a specific 8(a) Program Participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where SBA decides to accept an offering of a competitive 8(a) procurement, SBA will accept the offer for the 8(a)
program generally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) SBA will not accept a requirement as a competitive 8(a) procurement where a competition has been conducted by a
procuring agency prior to SBA's formal acceptance of the requirement for the 8(a) program and the procuring agency
seeks SBA's acceptance in order to select an apparent successful offeror and/or transmit a contract to SBA for execution.
Such a competition conducted without obtaining SBA's formal acceptance of the procurement requirement for the 8(a)
program will not be considered an 8(a) competitive requirement. In such a case, SBA may accept the requirement for
the 8(a) program as a competitive 8(a) requirement, but the procuring agency would be required to use appropriate
competition procedures again, including issuing a new solicitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Except for requirements assigned a construction SIC code by the procuring agency contracting officer, all competitive
8(a) requirements accepted by SBA may be competed among all eligible 8(a) Program Participants nationally. The only
geographic restrictions pertaining to 8(a) competitive requirements, other than those for construction requirements,
would be those imposed by the solicitations themselves.

Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) For purposes of the 8(a) program, a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) is not an 8(a) contract award. Each order to be
issued under the BOA is an individual contract. As such, there must be a separate offer and acceptance of each BOA order
before it may be issued through the 8(a) program as an 8(a) contract award. The 8(a) Participant must be eligible to
receive each new order at the time of the order. For example, a concern's size status does not relate back to the time
that the BOA was executed. Instead, a concern must be small at the time of the issuance of each new order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Once a concern's term of program participation expires, or the concern otherwise exits the 8(a) program, new orders
cannot be issued through the 8(a) program because the concern is no longer eligible to receive new 8(a) awards.

Adverse Impact.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SBA has made a written determination that acceptance of the procurement for 8(a) award would have an adverse impact
on an individual small business, a group of small businesses located in a specific geographical location, or other
small business programs. The adverse impact concept is designed to protect small business concerns which are performing
or are seeking to perform Government contracts awarded outside the 8(a) program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In determining whether or not the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on an individual small
business, SBA will consider all relevant factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In connection with an individual small business, SBA presumes adverse impact to exist when a small business concern
has performed a specific requirement for at least 24 months, it is performing the requirement at the time it is offered
to the 8(a) program or its performance of the requirement ended within 30 days of the procuring agency's offer of the
requirement to the 8(a) program, and the dollar value of the requirement that the small business was performing is
25 percent or more of its most recent annual gross sales (including those of its affiliates).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, adverse impact does not apply to ``new'' requirements.
A new requirement is a requirement which has not been previously procured by the relevant procuring agency. Where
a requirement is new, no small business could have performed the requirement and, thus, an impact determination need
not be performed. Construction contracts by their very nature (e.g., the one-time building of a specific structure)
are new requirements. The expansion or alteration of an existing requirement shall be considered a new requirement
where the requirement is materially expanded or modified so that the ensuing requirement is not substantially similar
to the prior requirement due to the magnitude of the expansion or alteration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In determining whether or not the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on a group of small businesses
located in a specific geographical location, SBA shall consider the effects of a procuring agency bundling various
requirements being performed by two or more small business concerns into a larger contract which would be considered
a ``new'' requirement because of the magnitude of its expansion as compared to any of the previous smaller requirements.
In such a case, adverse impact may be found if one of the small business concerns meets the presumption set forth in paragraph
(c)(1)(i) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In determining whether or not the acceptance of a requirement would have an adverse impact on other small business
programs, SBA will consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to, whether or not SBA's acceptance of
a proposed 8(a) requirement is likely to result in SBA taking an inordinate portion of total procurements in the subject
industry to the detriment of the small business set-aside program.

40. Section 124.309 would be further amended by revising the phrase ``a sole source 8(a) contract'' in paragraph (d)
to read ``an 8(a) contract.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 Where a construction requirement offered to the 8(a) program exceeds the $3 million competitive threshold, SBA will

 A concern that has completed its term of participation in the 8(a) program, as set forth in &sect;124.110, may be awarded
a competitive 8(a) contract if it was a Program Participant eligible for award of the contract on the date specified
for receipt of offers contained in the contract solicitation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For a negotiated procurement, so long as a Program Participant is eligible as of the date specified for the receipt

to submit revised offers, including a best and final offer, and receive a competitive award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Joint ventures for Small Disadvantaged Business Set-Asides and Small Disadvantaged Business Evaluation Preferences.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Joint ventures are permitted for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) set-asides and SDB evaluation preferences,
provided that the requirements set forth in this paragraph are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For purposes of this paragraph, the term joint venture has the same meaning as that set forth in &sect;121.401(1)
of these regulations. Two or more concerns that form an ongoing relationship to conduct business would not be considered
``joint venturers'' within the meaning of this paragraph, and would also not be eligible as an entity owned and controlled
by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A concern that is owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals entering
into a joint venture agreement with one or more other business concerns is considered to be affiliated for size purposes
with such other concern(s). The combined annual receipts or employees of the concerns entering into the joint venture
must meet the applicable size standard corresponding to the SIC code designated for the contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The majority of the venture's earnings must accrue directly to the socially and economically disadvantaged individuals
in the SDB concern(s) in the joint venture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The percentage ownership involvement in a joint venture by disadvantaged individuals must be at least 51 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Small business concern A is 100% owned by disadvantaged individuals. Small business concern B is 100% owned by nondisadvantaged
individuals. The percentage involvement by concern A in a joint venture between A and B must be at least 51%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Small business concern C is 51% owned by disadvantaged individuals. Small business concern D is 100% owned by nondisadvantaged
individuals. Any joint venture between C and D would be ineligible because the amount of ownership involvement in
such a joint venture by disadvantaged individuals would be less than 51%. Even a 90% involvement by concern C in a joint
venture with D would mean an overall ownership involvement by disadvantaged individuals of only 45.9% (51% of 90),
and an overall ownership involvement by nondisadvantaged individuals of 54.1% (10 + (49% of 90)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Upon request by the Program Participant, SBA may waive the requirement for audited financial statements. Waivers
under this paragraph may be granted by the appropriate District Director only for the first year the audited financial
statements are required. Beyond such first year, only the AA/MSB&amp;COD may waive this requirement for good cause
shown by the Program Participant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Circumstances where waivers of audited financial statements may be granted include, but are not limited to,
the following: (A) the concern has an unexpected increase in sales towards the end of its fiscal year that creates an
unforeseen requirement for audited statements; (B) the concern unexpectedly experiences severe financial difficulties
which would make the cost of audited financial statements a particular burden; and (C) the concern has been an 8(a)
Program Participant less than 12 months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Program Participants with actual gross annual receipts of $1,000,000 to $4,999,999 shall submit to SBA reviewed
annual financial statements prepared by a licensed independent public accountant (as defined in part 107, Appendix
I, &para; II. B) within 90 days after the close of concern's fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Program Participants with actual gross annual receipts of less than $1,000,000 shall submit to SBA an annual statement
prepared in-house or compilation statement prepared by a licensed independent public accountant (as defined in
part 107, Appendix I, &para; II. B), verified as to accuracy by an authorized officer, partner, or sole proprietor
of the 8(a) concern, by signature and date, within 90 days after the close of the concern's fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any audited financial statements submitted to SBA pursuant to &sect;124.501(c) shall be prepared in accordance
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and reflect the independent public accountant's opinion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) While financial statements need not be submitted until 90 or 120 days after the close of an 8(a) concern's fiscal
year, depending on the receipts of the concern, every 8(a) concern must submit a final sales report signed by the CEO
or President to SBA within 10 working days of the end of its fiscal year in order for SBA to determine/verify the concern's
size for 8(a) contract awards and compliance with competitive business mix targets. This report must show a breakdown
of 8(a) and non-8(a) sales.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Audited or reviewed annual and/or quarterly statements may be required when SBA determines it is necessary to
obtain a more thorough verification of a concern's assets, liabilities, income and/or expenses, or to determine
the concern's capacity to perform a specific 8(a) contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The requirements for submitting financial statements also apply to 8(a) joint venture agreements.

 To allow a Certified Flight Instructor renewal to be granted to a military pilot with a favorable record of instruction,
or to a military flight examiner.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 -->
Petitioner's Reason for the Request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 The petitioner states that there is no provision for renewal of the CFI certificate based on instruction given during
military operations. The petitioner further states that the FARs are clear in referring to the practices of ``company''
check airmen, but make no distinction between check airmen for the airline industry and check airmen for the military.
The petitioner feels that the military aviation experience is credible, professional, and respected in the aviation
industry and should be acknowledged with full credit.

Description of Rulechange Sought:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 To establish an alternative or parallel path for aircraft inspection that would extend the existing annual inspection
requirement to 2 years or 200 hours, whichever comes first, for all aircraft in non-commercial service for whom such
a program would be advantageous. Additionally, the petitioner proposes that all such aircraft engaged in the biennial
inspection program would be subject to a periodic, clearly defined, mandatory field service and be returned to service
by an appropriately rated Aviation Maintenance Technician at intervals not to exceed the lesser of 50 flight hours
or 6 calendar months. Operators who typically fly their aircraft more than 200 hours in a 2 year period for whom this
proposed change would not most likely be economically advantageous, could continue to operate under the annual inspection
program currently prescribed to operate under the annual inspection program currently prescribed under &sect;91.409(a).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 -->
Petitioner's Reason for the Request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 The petitioner believes that the existing mandatory annual inspection interval does not adequately address the
true maintenance needs of the general aviation fleet and, in its view, misdirects millions of maintenance dollars
annually. The petitioner further believes that tailoring the regulatory maintenance and inspection requirements
to better suit the needs of general aviation, as proposed by its petition, would enhance aviation safety, better preserve
the general aviation fleet through improved ongoing maintenance, and save aircraft owners a percentage of the onerous
cost of annual inspections.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model
A320 series airplanes. This proposal would require repetitive inspections to verify proper installation of the
plain bushings of the upper and lower connection links on the forward and aft passenger/crew doors, and correction
of discrepancies, if necessary. This proposal would also require replacement of the shouldered bushing on the locking
mechanism with a new oversized bushing, which would terminate the repetitive inspection requirements. This proposal
is prompted by a report that, during an emergency evacuation of in-service airplanes, the left aft passenger/crew
door jammed against the fuselage structure in a nearly closed position due to bushing migration. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are intended to prevent jamming of the passenger/crew door, which could delay or impede the evacuation
of passengers during an emergency.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes. The DGAC
advises that, during an emergency evacuation of an in-service airplane, the left aft passenger/crew door jammed
against the fuselage structure in a nearly closed position. Investigation revealed the bushing of the lower connection
link had migrated. The cause of this migration has been attributed to the seizing of the upper locking hook into its
bronze bushing from the frame segment at the level of the door lifting bellcranks. This condition, if not corrected,
could result in jamming of the passenger/crew door, which could delay or impede the evacuation of passengers during
an emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus has issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;52&hyph;1047, dated April 25, 1994, which describes procedures for:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Performing repetitive detailed visual inspections to verify proper installation of the plain bushings of the
upper and lower connection links on the forward and aft passenger/crew doors; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Removing the passenger/crew door and inspecting the bushings to detect damage, if any bushing has migrated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Reinstalling the bushing, if the bushing housings are not damaged; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Reaming the door structure and installing an oversize shouldered bushing, if any bushing housing is damaged; and
repairing the bushing housing, if damage is not completely removed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Airbus has also issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;52&hyph;1027, Revision 3, dated December 10, 1993, which describes
procedures for replacing the shouldered bushing on the locking mechanism with a new oversized bushing, which will
prevent jamming of the passenger/crew door.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DGAC classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 93&hyph;207&hyph;048(B),
dated December 8, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require repetitive detailed visual inspections to
verify proper installation of the plain bushings of the upper and lower connection links on the forward and aft passenger/crew
doors, and correction of discrepancies, if necessary. The proposed AD would also require replacement of the shouldered
bushing on the locking mechanism with a new oversized bushing, which would terminate the repetitive inspection requirements.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.
Correction of certain discrepancies would be required to be accomplished in accordance with a method approved by
the FAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 99 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. It would take approximately
72 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required
parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the modification proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $392,040, or $3,960 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection at an average labor rate
of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspection proposed by this AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $32,670, or $330 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above figures, the total cost impact of the inspection and modification proposed by this AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $424,710, or $4,290 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model
767 series airplanes. This proposal would require replacement of the currently installed door opening actuators
of the emergency off-wing escape system with new, improved actuators. This proposal is prompted by reports indicating
that the requirements of a previously issued AD do not adequately preclude leakage from these actuators. The actions
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the escape slide to deploy, which could delay and possibly

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardize successful emergency evacuation of an airplane.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 15, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, amendment 39&hyph;8327 (57 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
47987, October 21, 1992), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 and Model 767 series airplanes. That AD requires
repetitive inspections (weighing program) of the door opening/snubbing actuators of the escape system (for Model
747 series airplanes) and the door opening/snubbing actuators of the off-wing escape slide (for Model 767 series
airplanes), and modification of the door latching mechanism of the escape slide compartment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a report from an operator of Model 767 series airplanes that several
actuators leaked following accomplishment of the modification procedures required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17.
Therefore, the FAA has determined that the modification requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 do not adequately
preclude leakage from these actuators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, this operator also reported that, during subsequent inspections (weighing program) of these actuators,
the weight in several actuators increased from the original weight measured during the initial inspection (weighing
program) required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. Therefore, the FAA finds that the inspection requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17
cannot reliably determine the fluid level of these actuators by the weighing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, since the issuance of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, the manufacturer has developed a new, improved actuator for
Model 767 series airplanes. These new actuators are not fluid-filled. The old actuators were fluid-filled and had
a tendency to leak, which caused the actuator to fail.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Failure of the door opening/snubbing actuator, if not corrected, could result in the escape slide failing to deploy,
which could delay and possibly jeopardize the successful emergency evacuation of an airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;25&hyph;0216, dated February 3, 1994, which
describes procedures for replacement of currently installed door opening actuators of the off-wing emergency escape
system with new, improved actuators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require replacement of the currently installed door opening actuators of the emergency
off-wing escape system on Model 767 series airplanes with new, improved actuators. The actions would be required
to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 to inspect the door opening/snubbing actuators of the off-wing escape
slide, and modify and inspect the door latching mechanism of the escape slide compartment of Model 767 series airplanes
have been retained in this proposal. However, accomplishment of the proposed actuator replacement would constitute
terminating action for those requirements. Accordingly, the FAA will, in a separate rulemaking action, revise AD
92&hyph;16&hyph;17 to remove these requirements for Model 767 series airplanes from that AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 460 Boeing Model 767 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 173 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspections and modification currently required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, and retained in this proposal, take
approximately 12 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts
cost approximately $510 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these inspections and modification
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $146,250, or $1,170 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed replacement would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane at an average labor rate of $55 per work
hour. Required parts would cost approximately $6,400 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the proposed replacement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,126,230, or $6,510 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most
prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy,
an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only
after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting
and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety
that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that
this cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed actions are necessary to restore
that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit
analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent failure of the escape slide to deploy, which could delay and possibly jeopardize successful emergency
evacuation of an airplane, accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Within 18 months after November 25, 1992 (the effective date of AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
92&hyph;16&hyph;17, amendment 39&hyph;8327), inspect the off-wing escape slide door opening/snubbing actuators
in accordance with OEA Service Bulletin 3092100&hyph;25&hyph;002, dated July 26, 1991. Repeat this inspection
thereafter at intervals not to exceed 20 months until the replacement required by paragraph (c) is accomplished.
For operators that have previously accomplished this inspection in accordance with AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17: This
paragraph requires that the next scheduled inspection be performed within 20 months after the last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection performed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Within 18 months after November 25, 1992 (the effective date of AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
92&hyph;16&hyph;17, amendment 39&hyph;8327), inspect and modify the escape slide compartment door latching mechanism
in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767&hyph;25A0174, dated August 15, 1991. Accomplishment of the
actions required by this paragraph prior to the effective date of this AD terminates the actions required by paragraph
(b)(2) of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Within 2 years after the effective date of this AD, replace the currently installed door opening actuator of the
emergency off-wing escape system with a new, improved actuator, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;25&hyph;0216,
dated February 3, 1994. Accomplishment of this replacement terminates the repetitive inspection requirements
of paragraph (a) of this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) As of 2 years after the effective date of this AD, only door opening actuators of the emergency off-wing escape system
having OEA part number 5262100 (Boeing part number 5416T208&hyph;12) shall be installed on any airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane
Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO.

Employer Identification Numbers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SSA maintains a record of the wages and self-employment income of each individual. The record includes earnings covered
under title II of the Social Security Act (the Act), earnings covered under title XVIII of the Act, and earnings not
covered under the Act. The record is identified by the individual's social security number. Wages posted to an individual's
record are based on wage reports submitted to SSA and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by employers. IRS regulations
at 26 CFR 31.6011(a)&hyph;1 require an employer to file employment tax returns with IRS each year and IRS regulations
at 26 CFR 31.6051&hyph;2 and 31.6091&hyph;1(d) require an employer to file wage reports with SSA each year. These
requirements are also explained on wage reporting forms and in related instructions issued by SSA and IRS. To help
account for these returns and reports, IRS assigns an employer identification number (EIN) to every employer. However,
SSA will assign a special identification number to one or more political subdivisions of a State which submits a modification
to its coverage agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) under section 218 of the Act. These
numbers are assigned only for State bookkeeping purposes unless coverage is extended to periods prior to 1987. Then,
the special number will be assigned and used for reporting the pre-1987 wages to SSA. The special number will also be
assigned to an interstate instrumentality if pre-1987 coverage is obtained.

Section 232 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 432, was added by section 8 of Public Law 94&hyph;202. Section 8 is cited as the ``Combined
Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance-Income Tax Reporting Amendments of 1975.'' Section 232 provides
authority for the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of HHS to make available such documents that are agreed
upon as being necessary for processing information contained in returns required by the Internal Revenue Code and
by IRS regulations. Under this authority and Pub. L. 94&hyph;455 and 95&hyph;216, SSA and IRS have entered into an
Agreement governing the manner in which employer wage reports will be processed. Included in this process are the
wage reports which employers are required to file annually with SSA. As required by IRS regulations at 26 CFR 301.6011&hyph;2,
employers who file 250 or more wage reports per year must file them on magnetic media, unless the requirement is waived
by IRS. These proposed regulations reflect these requirements for filing annual wage reports with SSA and explain
how SSA will process the reports and reconcile reporting errors with IRS, employees, and employers.

We are also proposing to consolidate &sect;&sect;

422.115 and 422.120 to include in one section (proposed &sect;422.120) our current procedures for processing wage
reports, submitted to us by employers, that do not include a worker's social security number or include an incorrect
name or number. The existing regulations provide that we will first contact the employer for the missing information
or correction. However, in the proposed regulation, we state our current procedure which is to attempt to contact
the employee first. Additionally, we provide that we may return to the employer a wage report submittal if 90 percent
or more of the wage reports are unidentified or incorrectly identified. We also explain in the proposed &sect;422.120
that we will inform IRS of all wage reports filed with SSA that do not include the required social security numbers.
IRS may then assess the employer a penalty for erroneous report filing, pursuant to the authority provided in section
6721 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6721.

Under section 6057 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6057, certain private pension plan administrators must
file with the IRS annual reports that identify individuals who separated from plan coverage during the year and still
have a right to future retirement benefits. In addition, this provision of the Internal Revenue Code provides for
transmitting copies of the annual reports to the Secretary of HHS. The copies are forwarded to SSA and transcribed
onto an electronic record for the purpose of maintaining the pension information which SSA must provide to specified
individuals, as explained below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1131 of the Act requires that whenever the Secretary of HHS makes a finding of fact and a decision as to the entitlement
of an individual to social security or medicare benefits under title II of the Act or is requested to do so, the Secretary
must transmit to the individual any information, as reported by the employer, regarding any deferred vested benefits
under a private pension plan. In these proposed rules, we explain how we administer this provision.

These proposed rules contain reporting requirements in &sect;&sect;422.114 (e) and (f) and 422.120(a). We would
normally seek approval of these requirements, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, from the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB). We are not doing so in this situation because we already have clearance from OMB to collect this information
using forms SSA&hyph;L93, 95 and 97 (OMB No. 0960&hyph;0432) and form SSA&hyph;2765 (OMB No. 0960&hyph;0694).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is also a reporting requirement in &sect;422.122, which deals with information on deferred vested pension
benefits. As required by section 2(a) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3504(h), we will submit a copy
to OMB for its review of this information collection requirement. Other organizations and individuals desiring
to submit comments on these information collection requirements should direct them to the Office of Information

. When a State submits a modification to its agreement with the Secretary under section 218 of the Act, SSA will assign
a special identification number to each political subdivision included in that modification. SSA will inform the
State of the special identification number(s) by sending a Form SSA&hyph;214&hyph;CD, ``Notice of Identifying
Number,'' to the State. These numbers are assigned only for State bookkeeping purposes unless coverage is extended
to periods prior to 1987. Then, the special number will be assigned and used for reporting the pre-1987 wages to SSA.
The special number will also be assigned to an interstate instrumentality if pre-1987 coverage is obtained and SSA
will send a Form SSA&hyph;214&hyph;CD to the interstate instrumentality to notify it of the number assigned.

(IRS) regulations at 26 CFR 31.6011(b)&hyph;1 to obtain an employer identification number (EIN) and to include it
on wage reports filed with SSA. A sole proprietor who does not pay wages to one or more employees or who is not required
to file any pension or excise tax return is not subject to this requirement. To apply for an EIN, employers file Form
SS&hyph;4, ``Application for Employer Identification Number,'' with the IRS. For the convenience of employers,
Form SS&hyph;4 is available at all SSA and IRS offices. Household employers, agricultural employers, and domestic
corporations which elect social security coverage for employees of foreign subsidiaries who are citizens or residents
of the U.S. may be assigned an EIN by IRS without filing an SS&hyph;4.

 Under the authority of section 232 of the Act, SSA and IRS have entered into an agreement that sets forth the manner by
which SSA and IRS will ensure that the processing of employee wage reports is effective and efficient. Under this agreement,
employers are instructed by IRS to file annual wage reports with SSA on paper Forms W&hyph;2, ``Wage and Tax Statement,''
and Forms W&hyph;3, ``Transmittal of Income and Tax Statements,'' or equivalent
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
 W&hyph;2 and W&hyph;3 magnetic media reports. Special versions of these forms for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa,
the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are also filed with SSA. SSA processes all
wage reporting forms for updating to SSA's earnings records and IRS tax records, identifies employer reporting errors
and untimely filed forms for IRS penalty assessment action, and takes action to correct any reporting errors identified,
except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. SSA also processes Forms W&hyph;3c, ``Transmittal of Corrected
Income Tax Statement,'' and W&hyph;2c, ``Statement of Corrected Income and Tax Amounts'' (and their magnetic media
equivalents) that employers are required to file with SSA when certain previous reporting errors are discovered.

Magnetic media reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under IRS regulations at 26 CFR 301.6011&hyph;2, employers who file 250 or more W&hyph;2 wage reports per year must
file them on magnetic media in accordance with requirements provided in SSA publications, unless IRS grants the employer
a waiver. Basic SSA requirements are set out in SSA's Technical Instruction Bulletin No. 4, ``Magnetic Media Reporting.''
Special filing requirements for U.S. territorial employers are set out in SSA Technical Instruction Bulletins No.
5 (Puerto Rico), No. 6 (Virgin Islands), and No. 7 (Guam and American Samoa). At the end of each year, SSA mails these
technical instructions to employers (or third parties who file wage reports on their behalf) for their use in filing
wage reports for that year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Processing late and incorrect magnetic media wage transmittals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If an employer's transmittal of magnetic media wage reports is received by SSA after the filing due date, SSA will notify
IRS of the late filing so that IRS can decide whether to assess penalties for late filing, pursuant to section 6721 of
the Internal Revenue Code. If reports do not meet SSA processing requirements (unprocessable reports) or are out
of balance on critical money amounts, SSA will return them to the employer to correct and resubmit. In addition, beginning
with wage reports filed for tax year 1993, if 90 percent or more of an employer's magnetic media wage reports have no
social security numbers or incorrect employee names or social security numbers so that SSA is unable to credit their
earnings to its records, SSA will not attempt to correct the errors, but will instead return the reports to the employer
to correct and resubmit (see also &sect;422.120(b)). An employer must correct and resubmit incorrect and unprocessable
magnetic media wage reports to SSA within 45 days from the date of the letter sent with the returned report. Upon request,
SSA may grant the employer a 15-day extension of the 45-day period. If an employer does not submit corrected reports
to SSA within the 45-day (or, if extended by SSA, 60-day) period, SSA will notify IRS of the late filing so that IRS can
decide whether to assess a penalty. If an employer timely resubmits the reports as corrected magnetic media reports,
but they are unprocessable or out of balance on W&hyph;2 money totals, SSA will return the resubmitted reports for
the second and last time for the employer to correct and return to SSA. SSA will enclose with the resubmitted and returned
forms a letter informing the employer that he or she must correct and return the reports to SSA within 45 days or be subject
to IRS penalties for late filing.

 The format and wage reporting instructions for paper forms are determined jointly by IRS and SSA. Basic instructions
on how to complete the forms and file them with SSA are provided in IRS forms materials available to the public. In addition,
SSA provides standards for employers (or third parties who file wage reports for them) to follow in producing completed
reporting forms from computer software; these standards appear in SSA publication, ``Software Specifications
and Edits for Annual Wage Reporting.'' Requests for this publication should be sent to: Social Security Administration,
Office of Financial Policy and Operations, Attention: AWR Software Standards Project, P.O. Box 17195, Baltimore,

will ask the employer to provide information necessary to process the reports without having to resubmit corrected
forms. If an employer fails to provide legible, complete, and correct W&hyph;2 reports within 45 days, SSA may identify
the employers to IRS for assessment of employer reporting penalties.

or medicare wages reported to SSA for employees is less than the totals reported to IRS, SSA will write to the employer
and request corrected reports or an explanation for the discrepancy. If the total social security or medicare wages
reported to SSA for employees is more than the totals reported to IRS, IRS will resolve the difference with the employer.
If the employer fails to provide SSA with corrected reports or information that shows the wage reports filed with SSA
are correct, SSA will ask IRS to investigate the employer's wage and tax reports to resolve the discrepancy and to assess
any appropriate reporting penalties.

Correcting an earnings report
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If an employer reports an employee's wages without the employee's social security number or with a different employee
name or social security number than shown in SSA's records for him or her, SSA will write to the employee at the address
shown on the wage report and request the missing or corrected information. If the wage report does not show the employee's
address or shows an incomplete address, SSA will write to the employer and request the missing or corrected employee
information. SSA notifies IRS of all wage reports filed without employee social security numbers so that IRS can decide
whether to assess penalties for erroneous filing, pursuant to section 6721 of the Internal Revenue Code. If an individual
reports self-employment income without a social security number or with a different name or social security number
than shown in SSA's records, SSA will write to the individual and request the missing or corrected information. If
the employer, employee, or self-employed individual does not provide the missing or corrected report information
in response to SSA's request, the wages or self-employment income cannot be identified and credited to the proper
individual's earnings records. In such cases, the information is maintained in a ``Suspense File'' of uncredited
earnings. Subsequently, if identifying information is provided to SSA for an individual whose report is recorded
in the Suspense File, the wages or self-employment income then may be credited to his or her earnings record.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Returning incorrect reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. SSA may return to the filer, unprocessed, an employer's annual wage report submittal if 90 percent or more of the wage
reports in that submittal are unidentified or incorrectly identified. In such instances, SSA will advise the filer
to return corrected wage reports within 45 days to avoid any possible IRS penalty assessment for failing to file correct
reports timely with SSA (see also &sect;422.114(c)). Upon request, SSA may grant the employer a 15-day extension
of the 45-day period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claimants for benefits
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each month, SSA checks the name and social security number of each new claimant for social security benefits or for
hospital insurance coverage to see whether the claimant is listed in SSA's electronic pension benefit record. This
record contains information received from IRS on individuals for whom private pension plan administrators have
reported to IRS, as required by section 6057 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 6057), as possibly having a right
to future retirement benefits under the plan. SSA sends a notice to each new claimant for whom it has pension benefit
information, as required by section 1131 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b&hyph;1). If the claimant filed for the lump-sum
death payment on the social security account of a relative, SSA sends the claimant the pension information on the deceased
individual. In either case, SSA sends the notice after it has made a decision on the claim for benefits. The notice shows
the type, payment frequency, and amount of pension benefit, as well as the name and address of the plan administrator
as reported to the IRS. This information can then be used by the claimant to claim any pension benefits still due from
the pension plan.

 Section 1131 of the Act also requires SSA to provide available pension benefit information on request. SSA will provide
this pension benefit information only to the individual who has the pension coverage (or a legal guardian or parent,
in the case of a minor, on the individual's behalf). However, if the individual is deceased, the information may be
provided to someone who would be eligible for any underpayment of benefits that might be due the individual under &sect;404.503(b)
of part 404 of this chapter. All requests for such information must be in writing and should contain the following information:
the individual's name, social security number, date of birth, and parent's names; any information the requester
may have concerning the name of the pension plan involved and the month and year coverage under the plan ended; the name
and address of the person to whom the information is to be sent; and the requester's signature under the following statement:
``I am the individual to whom the information applies (or ``I am related to the individual as his or her

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is approving the State's SIP revision, as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule,
no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule
will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action
should do so at this time.

 The purpose of this document is to announce the availability of three reports that EPA is considering as it develops
the final Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System (final Guidance) and to request public comment on the possible

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(1)) requires EPA to publish and periodically update National
ambient water quality criteria. These criteria are to reflect the latest scientific knowledge on the identifiable
effects of pollutants on public health and welfare, aquatic life and recreation. Section 118(c)(2) of the Clean Water
Act requires EPA to publish water quality guidance for the Great Lakes System which includes guidance on numerical
limits on pollutants in ambient Great Lakes waters to protect human health, aquatic life and wildlife. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final Guidance will establish minimum water quality standards, antidegradation policies, and implementation
procedures for waters within the Great Lakes System in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, including waters within the jurisdiction of Indian Tribes within the Great
Lakes System.

A. Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the toxicity tests used to develop EPA metals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for aquatic life, some fraction of the metal is dissolved while some fraction is precipitated or bound to
particulate matter. It is generally believed that dissolved metals are more available for uptake by aquatic organisms
than the bound or precipitated metal fractions and thus more likely to exert a toxic effect. The present National criteria
to protect aquatic life were developed using total recoverable metal measurements or measures expected to give equivalent
results in toxicity tests, and are expressed as total recoverable. In the past, States and Tribes have independently
made the decision to express their metals criteria as either dissolved metal concentrations or total recoverable
concentrations when applying the National aquatic life criteria.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The acute and chronic aquatic life criteria presented in the proposed Guidance were expressed using total recoverable
metal measurements, in conformance with the EPA policy at the time. In the preamble to the proposed Guidance, it was
noted that a State or Tribe had flexibility when deriving criteria to choose either the total recoverable or dissolved
contaminant concentrations. EPA suggested that a site-specific criteria modification procedure known as the water-effects
ratio could address concerns about the bioavailability and toxicity of total recoverable or dissolved concentrations.
The preamble also indicated that EPA would promulgate total recoverable metals criteria for those States and Tribes
who failed to adopt the criteria within the specified time period as written in the proposed Guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) recommended in its December 16, 1992, report, ``Evaluation of the Guidance
for the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative,'' that EPA consider both the biologically active form and the total
contaminant concentrations of a pollutant when establishing water quality criteria (USEPA, 1992). To further elicit
comment on the use of total recoverable vs. dissolved metal concentrations in developing future National aquatic
life criteria, EPA held a meeting with invited experts in January 1993 in Annapolis, Maryland. The Agency solicited
comments on the recommendations made by the presenters at the meeting in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 9, 1993 (58 FR 32131). Based on the data presented at the conference, and the individual opinions of the majority
of assembled scientists, EPA determined that the dissolved metal concentration approximates the bioavailable
fraction of waterborne metals for aquatic organisms better than the total recoverable concentration of metals.
However, the scientists believed the total recoverable measurements in ambient water also have value, because exceedances
of criteria on a total recoverable basis indicate that metal loadings could be a stress to the ecosystem, particularly
in locations other than the water column. As a follow-up to the meeting, on October 1, 1993, EPA's Office of Water issued
a memorandum to all EPA Regional Water Management Division Directors providing policy and guidance on the interpretation
and implementation of aquatic life criteria for the management of metals (USEPA, 1993). The memorandum covered a
number of areas including the expression of aquatic life criteria, total maximum daily loads, permits, effluent
monitoring, compliance, and ambient monitoring. With regard to expression of aquatic life criteria, the memorandum
recommended that State water quality standards be based on dissolved metals because dissolved metal concentrations
more closely approximate the bioavailable fraction of metal in the water column than does total recoverable metal
concentrations. However, because the present National aquatic life criteria were developed using total recoverable
measurements, it is necessary to use a conversion factor to convert the total recoverable metal concentrations to
equivalent dissolved metal concentrations. The October 1993 memorandum suggested conversion factors for 10 metals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since that time, additional work has been completed to refine these conversion factors. Possible conversion factors
for seven of the nine metals included in Tables 1 and 2 of the proposed Guidance for aquatic life are included in Table
1 of this Notice along with a conversion factor for lead. In addition, Table 1 includes preliminary conversion factors
for cadmium and mercury(II). The basis for the cadmium and mercury(II) conversion factors can be found in the October
1993 memorandum discussed above. Additional tests for cadmium and mercury(II) are being conducted as described
in the report ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests''.
EPA does not at this time have any reason to believe that the final conversion factors for cadmium and mercury(II) will
be different. EPA does not intend to provide additional opportunity to comment on the final conversion factors for
cadmium and mercury(II).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The methodology and data used to derive the nine conversion factors can be found in the report ``Results of Simulation
Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests,'' which is available in the public docket
as described in the addresses section of this notice. To use these factors, a State or Tribe would multiply the criterion
for a metal in Table 1 or 2 of the proposed Guidance by the conversion factor in Table 1 of this notice. For example, if
the acute water quality criterion for chromium(III) based on total recoverable metal concentration is 15 ug/L and
the conversion factor is 0.333, then the equivalent dissolved metal concentration for chromium(III) would be 5.0
ug/L.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA were to publish the final Guidance with metals criteria expressed as dissolved concentrations, States and
Tribes would be required to adopt metals criteria consistent with the final Guidance. In that situation, a State or
Tribe could adopt criteria expressed as dissolved criteria, or they could choose to adopt the total recoverable criteria
without using conversion factors as in the proposed Guidance, since it is a more stringent approach. If a State or Tribe
did not adopt metals criteria consistent with the final Guidance, EPA would promulgate dissolved metals criteria
for that State or Tribe. This approach is consistent with the recommendations made by the Science Advisory Board and
the scientists who attended the January 1993 meeting in Annapolis, Maryland.

B. 1991&hyph;1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The rate of fish consumption is an aspect of exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in the methodology for deriving human health criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current fish consumption rate used in the derivation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National ambient water quality criteria is 6.5 grams/day, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which represents a National average consumption value per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person for freshwater and estuarine fish and shellfish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Guidance included a fish consumption rate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15 grams/day, which represents the mean exposure level for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regionally caught fish for the regional sportfishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population. This estimate was made from a review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several regional studies in Michigan, Wisconsin and New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
York. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A study conducted by West et al., ``1991&hyph;1992 Michigan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study,'' for the State of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Michigan was submitted during the public comment period for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed Guidance. The study had three main 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objectives: (1) to determine fish consumption patterns that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could then be used in setting water quality standards in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Michigan; (2) to determine angler compliance with Michigan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish consumption advisories and patterns of preparing fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended in fish consumption advisories; and (3) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine which sub-populations are at greatest risk so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that educational programs about fish consumption advisories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be targeted to those populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The survey was conducted over one year and included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7000 licensed Michigan anglers who were sampled by mail. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systematic random sample was drawn such that stratification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by geographic region and license type within each region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was used to ensure that each licensed angler had the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chance of being selected. By ordering the population by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license type within a region, a proportionate State-wide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of anglers was achieved. Questionnaires were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mailed in two-week cohorts throughout the study period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 30, 1991 through January 29, 1992. Surveyed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals were asked to report detailed fish consumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patterns over the preceding 7 days. The survey reported a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response rate of about 47%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authors of the report include seven options that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represented their opinions on the possible policy choices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the State of Michigan. The seven policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 1_6.5 grams/day. This represents the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption level for the State of Michigan as a whole (not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
just sportanglers). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 2_14.5 grams/day. This represents the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sport fish consumption level by Michigan sport fishermen, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted for non-response bias. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 3_24.3 grams/day. This represents the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total fish consumption level by Michigan sport fishermen, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted for non-response bias.

of the final Guidance methodology for deriving human health

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As explained in the preamble for the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidance, aquatic organisms accumulate chemicals in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tissues from exposure to chemicals from all sources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including food and water. Further, as organisms at lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trophic levels are consumed by organisms at higher trophic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels, tissue concentrations of some chemicals increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of biomagnification, chemical levels in top 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predators may be orders of magnitude higher than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of the chemical in the ambient water. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the development of National water quality criteria, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used the term ``bioconcentration factors (BCF)'' to reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the propensity of an organism to accumulate a chemical in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its tissues. When field-measured bioaccumulation factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(BAFs) were not available, BCFs were used as estimates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs. In the proposed Guidance, EPA requested comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two uses of BAFs, which account for exposure from all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, EPA calculated BAFs for individual chemicals at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different trophic levels. The BAFs at the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trophic level consumed by humans and wildlife species were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then used to derive human health and wildlife criteria. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general, if all other factors were equal, a chemical with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher bioaccumulation factor would have a lower (more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent) criterion. Second, EPA used the human health

BAFs to identify a list of ``bioaccumulative chemicals of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern'' which warrant increased attention in the Great 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lakes Basin. See Section II.G. (at 58 FR 20843) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble to the proposed Guidance (58 FR 20802). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is today soliciting comment on additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical information about BAFs and alternative options to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaching four issues described in the proposed Guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also soliciting comment on the newly calculated BAFs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the chemicals in Tables 3 and 4 of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidance for human health and wildlife species based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information and options discussed in this Notice. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs, if promulgated, would change the criteria for human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and wildlife in Tables 3 and 4 of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Guidance included a hierarchy of three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods for deriving BAFs for organic chemicals: a field- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured BAF; a BAF predicted by multiplying a BCF measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the laboratory by a food chain multiplier (FCM); and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAF predicted from a BCF calculated from the chemical's n- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
octanol/water partition coefficient (K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
ow
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and multiplied by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a FCM. For inorganic chemicals, EPA proposed to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either a field-measured BAF or BCF. The four issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in this Notice all pertain to the derivation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs for organic chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is considering whether it should revise its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed methodology for the calculation of BAFs in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Great Lakes System to incorporate the information discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Technical Support Document, 1994, and summarized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below. The material discussed in sections C.1, C.2, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C.3 would replace portions of the proposed Guidance. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material discussed in section C.4 would provide a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method for deriving a BAF for organic chemicals and this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method would be added to the hierarchy of methods for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organics described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the proposed Guidance, EPA proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require States and Tribes to adopt requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of BAFs that are consistent with EPA's final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology. Although the State or Tribal regulation need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not duplicate this methodology, the State's or Tribe's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method must produce a BAF at least as stringent as the BAFs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derived by using EPA's methodology. If EPA incorporates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the topics discussed in the Technical Support Document, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, and this Notice into its methodology, States and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tribes will be required to reflect them in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodologies and derivation of BAFs. EPA also notes that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if EPA incorporates the material discussed in sections C.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to C.4 into its methodology for deriving a BAF, EPA would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use this material in promulgating BAFs for any State or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tribe.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed Guidance, human health and wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bioaccumulation factors for organic chemicals were based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total concentration of the chemical in water. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highly lipophilic chemicals, however, a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of the total concentration can be associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon (DOC) in water and be unavailable for accumulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs, whether measured or predicted, can be derived using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the concentration of the chemical that is freely dissolved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the water in order to account for bioavailability. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested comment on the concept of basing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bioaccumulation factors for lipophilic organic chemicals on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the freely dissolved concentration instead of the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration, but did not provide a specific equation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deriving the freely dissolved concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this Notice, EPA is requesting comment on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equation included in the Technical Support Document, July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, which defines the relationship of a BAF reported on

would also allow consistent usage and derivation of BAFs

through out the Guidance if a model similar to the model

Equation 4 implicitly assumes that n-octanol is an

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1993). For the Gobas model, the BCF

the growth rate of the organisms and the metabolism rate of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, equation 4 is supported and consistent with the

equilibrium partitioning theory being developed by EPA for

the derivation of sediment quality criteria (Di Toro et al.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that predicting the BCF based on equation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4 may provide a more consistent and scientifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defensible basis for establishing a predicted BAF than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equation by Veith and Kosian, 1983. EPA asks for comments

on the use of equation 4 for predicting BCFs.

3. Food Chain Multiplier Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second and third methods in the proposed Guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for deriving BAFs for organic chemicals both require use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a FCM based on a biomagnification model by Thomann (1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the proposed Guidance, EPA calculated the FCMs using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thomann's 1989 model of the step-wise increase in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of an organic chemical from phytoplankton 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(trophic level 1) through the top predatory fish of a food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chain (trophic level 4). Food chain multipliers derived 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the model ranged from less than one to 100. Under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed Guidance, FCMs greater than one would usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to organic chemicals with log K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
ow
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 values in the range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 4.0 to 6.5. EPA asked for comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriateness of FCMs based on the Thomann model, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested possible alternatives to the Thomann model for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predicting BAFs from BCFs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this Notice, EPA requests comment on the use of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model by Gobas (1993) to determine FCMs for non-polar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic chemicals. This model includes both benthic and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pelagic food chains thereby incorporating exposures of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organisms to chemicals from both the sediment and the water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
column. The Thomann 1989 model included only the pelagic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food chain and therefore did not account for exposure from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sediment to the aquatic organisms. The model by Gobas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1993) predicts a) the chemical residues in the organisms, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and b) the freely dissolved concentration of the chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the water column (C

The resulting FCMs for trophic levels 2, 3, and 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
along with the input parameters for the model, are included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Technical Support Document, July 1994. Based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data in the TSD, EPA believes the Gobas model acceptably

predicts BAFs for the Great Lakes System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is considering using the food chain model of Gobas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for deriving FCMs because a) it is easier to define the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
input data needed to run the model, b) predicted BAFs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in better agreement with measured BAFs for chemicals with

very high log K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organisms, consistent with EPA's sediment criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

EPA is requesting comment on the appropriateness of

4. Biota-Sediment Accumulation Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained above, the proposed Guidance presented a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hierarchy of three methods to derive BAFs for non-polar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic chemicals. In this Notice, EPA requests comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifying the proposed Guidance's hierarchy by adding a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predicted BAF based on a biota-sediment accumulation factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(BSAF) as the second method in the hierarchy. The revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hierarchy would reflect this modification as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
1. A BAF measured in the field; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A BAF predicted from a field-measured BSAF, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology discussed below; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A BAF predicted by multiplying a BCF measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the laboratory by the food chain multiplier; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A BAF predicted by multiplying a BCF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated from the log K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=5 f=2 -->
ow
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 by the food chain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiplier. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
BSAFs may be used for measuring and predicting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bioaccumulation directly from concentrations of chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in surface sediment. They may also be used to estimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs (Cook et al., 1993; 1994). Since BSAFs are based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field data and incorporate effects of metabolism, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biomagnification, growth, etc., BAFs estimated from BSAFs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will incorporate the net effect of all these factors. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSAF approach is particularly beneficial for developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality criteria for chemicals such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and certain biphenyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
congeners which are detectable in fish tissues and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sediments but are difficult to measure in the water column 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and have reduced bioaccumulation potential due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BSAFs are measured by relating lipid-normalized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of chemicals in an organism to organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon-normalized concentrations of the chemicals in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface sediment samples associated with the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure environment of the organism. The BSAF is defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Differences between BSAFs for different organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals are good measures of the relative bioaccumulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentials of the chemicals. When calculated from a common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organism/sediment sample set, chemical-specific differences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in BSAFs primarily reflect the net effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biomagnification, metabolism, and bioenergetics and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bioavailability factors on each chemical's disequilibrium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratio between biota and sediment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed Guidance, ratios of BSAFs of PCDDs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PCDFs to a BSAF for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD) were proposed for evaluation of 2,3,7,8&hyph;TCDD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxic equivalency associated with complex mixtures of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals (bioaccumulation equivalency factors, see 58 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20802). The same approach is applicable to calculation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs for other organic chemicals. The approach requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data for a steady-state or near steady-state condition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between sediment and water for both a reference chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preamble to the proposed Guidance included a list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Bioaccumulation Equivalency Factors (BEFs) for PCDDs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and PCDFs that could be used when converting concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of PCDDs and PCDFs to equivalent concentrations of 2,3,7,8- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCDD. These BEFs have been updated since the proposal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are included in Table 2. The technical rationale for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised BEFs is provided in the Technical Support Document, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1994. EPA requests comment on the revised BEFs.

Guidance have been recalculated incorporating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications to the BAF methodology discussed above. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs for these chemicals are compared with the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs in Tables 3 and 4 of this Notice. In addition, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes under consideration in this Notice are incorporated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the final Guidance, the BAF for 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would increase from 836 to 1,570. This is significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene could then be classified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Bioaccumulative Chemical of Concern (BCC), chemicals with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAFs greater than 1000, which could require special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions for control as discussed in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the proposed Guidance, the human health BAFs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated using trophic level 4 and assuming a lipid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content in fish of 5 percent. The wildlife BAFs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated using trophic level 3 or 4 as appropriate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wildlife species and assuming a lipid content in fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 7.9 percent. The derivation of the BAFs for the 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human health criteria, the 4 wildlife criteria, and 1,2,4- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trichlorobenzene are included in the Technical Support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document for Bioaccumulation Factors, July 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comments on: (1) The BAFs derived using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the modifications to the BAF methodology; and (2) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene to the list of BCCs.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Agency) is today proposing to grant a site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatability variance from the Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment standards for F037 and F038 nonwastewaters that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in, and to be removed from, a 26 acre surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundment (Surge Pond). The specific waste was generated when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Surge Pond filled with water and primary sludge from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of process wastewater and stormwater at the Citgo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation petroleum refinery located outside Lake Charles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Louisiana. Approximately 625,000 tons of waste remains in and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be removed from the surface impoundment; this waste was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to a national capacity variance until June 30, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If this proposal is finalized, Citgo may complete their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remediation effort that was approved by the Louisiana Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) and EPA Region VI, provided they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the alternative treatment standards specified in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, and also comply with any other applicable land disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictions for this waste as specified in 40 CFR Part 268.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 3004(m) of the Hazardous and Solid Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), EPA is required to set ``levels or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods of treatment, if any, which substantially diminish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity of the waste or substantially reduce the likelihood of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
migration of hazardous constituents from the waste so that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-term and long-term threats to human health and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment are minimized.'' EPA has interpreted this language to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mean treatment standards based on the performance of best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated available technology (BDAT). This interpretation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was sustained by the D.C. Circuit in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, 886 F.2d 355 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D.C. Cir. 1989), cert. den. 111 S. Ct. 139 (1990). The Agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, has recognized that there may be wastes that cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated to the levels specified in the rules, due to the fact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the wastes are in a form that is substantially more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to treat than those the Agency evaluated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing the treatment standard (51 FR 40576, November 7, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1986), or where the treatment technology is inappropriate for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste. For such wastes, EPA has established a treatability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance (40 CFR 268.44), to establish alternative treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements for qualifying for a site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatability variance are contained in 40 CFR 268.44(h), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states, ``Where the treatment standard is expressed as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration in a waste or waste extract and a waste generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under conditions specific to only one site cannot be treated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the specified level or where the treatment technology is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to the waste, the generator or treatment facility may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to the Administrator, or her designated representative, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a site-specific variance from the treatment standard. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant for a site-specific variance must demonstrate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the physical or chemical properties of the waste differ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly from the waste analyzed in developing the treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, the waste cannot be treated to specified levels or by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the specified methods.'' For a more thorough discussion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions which justify granting a treatability variance and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting information the petitioner is required to submit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Site Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specific site addressed by this proposed variance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located at Citgo Corporation's Lake Charles Refinery, 4401 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Louisiana Highway 108 in Calcasieu County in the southwest corner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Louisiana. The surface impoundment in question, referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the ``Surge Pond'' in Citgo's literature, is situated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately adjacent to the west bank of the Calcasieu River, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 10 miles southwest of Lake Charles and 15 miles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
north of the Sabine National Wildlife Refuge. The Surge Pond has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a surface area of twenty six (26) acres. Much of the pond is 15 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 20 feet deep; the deepest part is about 40 feet deep. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water surface elevation of the pond is six feet above sea level; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the water layer is about 15 feet deep. The bottom of the pond is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filled with sludge which has been accumulating since the 1940's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pond has been receiving untreated petroleum refining process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water and stormwater runoff from the site throughout most of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site's history. The sludge at the bottom of the pond is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary sludge generated by the settling of petroleum refining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater and thus meets the definition of RCRA Hazardous Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Codes F037 and F038. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Surge Pond discharges into the old onsite wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment system. This system consists of an earthen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equalization basin, followed by dissolved air flotation (DAF) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanks, an earthen aeration basin, clarifier tanks, a settling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pond, a polishing pond, and then discharges into the Calcasieu 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river at a NPDES regulated outfall (Permit number LA0005941). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(The company's request for a treatability variance only includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludge from the Surge Pond; it does not include any sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by the rest of the old wastewater treatment system.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new onsite wastewater treatment system has been in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation since May 13, 1994. The system now receives stormwater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and process wastewater from the site. The system consists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily of above ground tanks with floating roofs. Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from the tanks are routed to a vapor control system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new wastewater flow path is from API separators, to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equalization tank, to a DAF unit, to aerated activated sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tanks, to a clarifier. Clarifier effluent discharges to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settling pond of the old wastewater treatment system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Regulations Applying to Citgo's Surge Pond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Surge Pond began operating in the late 1940's, and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been generating sludge since that time. The RCRA regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history of the impoundment, set out in full in Citgo's petition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is complicated. (See Citgo's variance petition for a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thorough discussion of the regulatory history of Citgo's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refinery.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of this history is not relevant for evaluating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition. It is clear, however, that the sludge in the pond is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed as F037 and F038; as such, it became subject to the land 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal restriction treatment requirements and prohibitions on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 30, 1994, the date that the national capacity variance for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this waste expired. See &sect;268.36 (c), promulgated at 57 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37271 (Aug. 18, 1992). Thus, the sludge or any residues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated from its treatment cannot be placed on the land, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including back in the Surge Pond, unless first treated to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the treatment standards for F037/F038, since the impoundment does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not qualify as a section 3005 (j) (11) impoundment. Nor does the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company want to put the treated sludge back into the impoundment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The company has also constructed a new tank-based wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment system to replace the old system of surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundments.

2. Listing and LDR Treatment Standards for F037 and F038 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated earlier, sludge from the Surge Pond meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of F037 and F038 nonwastewaters. The listing of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste codes was promulgated on November 2, 1990 (55 FR 46354) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended on May 13, 1991 (56 FR 21955). LDR treatment standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these wastes were finalized on August 18, 1992 (Phase I LDR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final treatment standards for nonwastewaters set total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration limits for 14 hazardous organic constituents based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the performance of combustion or solvent extraction, TCLP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leachate concentration limits for nickel and chromium based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stabilization, and a total cyanide standard based on combustion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a two-year national capacity variance was granted for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F037/F038 wastes generated from the cleanout of surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundments, on the basis of a determination that existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity at bulk solid incineration systems was insufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treat these wastes. This capacity variance expired on June 30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994. Before this date, these wastes could be land disposed in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subtitle C facility without meeting the LDR treatment standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also determined that impoundments receiving F037/F038 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes during the national capacity variance would continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have four years from the promulgation of the F037/F038 listing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date to retrofit the impoundments to meet the minimum technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements (MTRs), or to close them (59 FR 37220&hyph;37221). After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 30, 1994, the wastes must meet either the LDR treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards or alternative standards established by a treatability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citgo conducted a feasibility study in early 1993 (after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation of the LDRs for F037/F038) to compare and evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their options for closing the Surge Pond. The closure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives considered were a ``no action'' alternative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traditional RCRA clean closure, traditional RCRA in-situ closure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a landfill, closure by removal followed by risk assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(risk based closure), and delay of closure. Citgo chose to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursue closure by removal followed by risk assessment (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citgo's variance petition for the basis of their decision). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative entailed treatment and disposal of a tremendous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity of F037/F038 nonwastewater that was to be removed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pond. The treatment technologies considered in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasibility study included:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time this feasibility study was conducted (early 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993), approximately a year and a half remained before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expiration of the national capacity variance for the F037/F038 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes. Citgo planned that the cleanout would be finished and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that all the sludge removed would be landfilled in a subtitle C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit meeting the minimum technology requirements, as required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;268.5(h)(2), before the national capacity variance expired. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They constructed a treatment system which is designed to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NESHAP waste limit for benzene and controls air emissions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated waste also must meet certain landfill acceptance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria. In particular, this treatment system meets the LDR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level for benzene and also achieves oil recovery, partial removal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of volatile organics, and dewatering and stabilization of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludge which meets LDR standards for nickel and chromium (the two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated metals in F037/F038 wastes); however, the treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system would not meet the LDR treatment standards for most of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
semivolatile organics. Wastewater from the system is redisposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
back into the Surge Pond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citgo hired a contractor to perform the removal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of the Surge Pond sludge. The conditions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract stated that the clean-up must be completed before June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30, 1994. However, due to technical difficulties with scale-up, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dewatering performance, and the automatic control system for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vapor recovery system, the progress of the clean-up was seriously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delayed. In early 1994, it became clear to Citgo that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clean-up would not be finished before the expiration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national capacity variance and that they would need a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatability variance from the LDRs in order to continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposing of the residuals from their existing sludge treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the most significant distinguishing characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this waste is its tremendous quantity. The feasibility study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted in early 1993 estimated that the total volume of sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the Surge Pond was 770,000 cubic yards, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total mass as 745,000 tons with a 30% solids content (230,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tons dry solids). However, Citgo indicated in its petition that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it now appears that these quantities were underestimated by as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
much as 25%, which would mean that the original mass of sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was about 993,000 tons. Citgo indicated that approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
625,000 tons of sludge would remain in the pond after June 30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, the date that the national capacity variance for this waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expired. This is the quantity of waste that will be affected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposed variance. Approximately 427,000 tons of solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residual will be generated by the treatment of the waste in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surge Pond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sampling and analysis of the sludge was performed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citgo's feasibility study and again for this variance petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concentrations of hazardous constituents in untreated sludge are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarized in table A.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The treatment system Citgo is using consists of air sparging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in tanks to remove benzene (other volatiles do not appear to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed effectively) followed by sludge dewatering. Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions from some of the unit processes (shaker system, air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sparging tanks, and chemical mix tanks) are routed to a vapor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control system which consists of scrubbers for removal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrogen sulfide and a portable thermal oxidizer for destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of volatile organics. The dewatered sludge is then mixed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lime or flyash for purposes of stabilization of metals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing structural integrity to meet the landfill acceptance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria. The stabilized sludge is land disposed at Chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste Management's Subtitle C landfill in Carlyss, Louisiana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The liquid phase goes to tanks functioning as oil-water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separators for recovery of oil; approximately 18% of the oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present in the sludge is recovered. The aqueous discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(wastewater) from the separators is discharged back into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surge Pond; overflow from the Surge Pond discharges into the old 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater treatment system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations that the sludge treatment system must satisfy

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters, air emission limits, the benzene NESHAP limit (10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ppm), and structural criteria for acceptance at the landfill.

F. Summary of Citgo's Petition for a Treatability Variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Citgo submitted a site-specific treatability variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition to EPA on April 13, 1994, and submitted additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials as per EPA's request. The petition requests that EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow Citgo to continue land disposing the treated sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by the remediation of the Surge Pond and to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternate LDR standards for their F037/F038 nonwastewaters. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative treatment standards suggested by Citgo are presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in table B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citgo made the following arguments as justification for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Citgo claimed that incineration is not an appropriate (technology for this waste because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) the tremendous quantity of wastes generated by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remediation exceeds the annual excess capacity available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationwide for F037/F038 wastes (Citgo estimated that the eight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incinerators willing to treat their F037/F038 waste can treat 374 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thousand tons of F037/F038 wastes per year; the Surge Pond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remediation will generate approximately 427 thousand tons of waste after June 30), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the metal content of this waste (4,084 ppm reported average) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is higher than that of typical F037/F038 wastes, such that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incineration of this waste could release large quantities of metals to the atmosphere, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) the hazards of transporting the waste long distances for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offsite incineration exceed the hazards of treating the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
onsite and disposing the residuals in the subtitle C landfill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seven miles from the site. Citgo estimated that transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 427 thousand tons of waste to offsite incinerators would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require a total of 24 million highway miles and result in 48 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traffic accidents (24 with a possible release of hazardous material to the environment) and 7 traffic fatalities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Citgo claimed that cement kiln combustion is inappropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this waste due to the low BTU content (less than 2,000 BTU/lb) of the waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Citgo claimed that, ``When compared with other treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options, the CITGO approach is clearly the safest for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment and human health.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The company could simply close the impoundment with the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in place, thus doing no treatment at all. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

II. Basis for Proposed Treatability Variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. EPA Evaluation of Citgo's Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful evaluation, EPA is proposing to grant a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatability variance for the F037 and F038 nonwastewaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by the remediation of the Surge Pond, subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions described in section II.B. Our basis for proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant the petition is described below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) EPA wants the remediation of the Surge Pond to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed. Although Citgo has stated that they prefer to close 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Surge Pond by removal of the sludge followed by a risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment, the closure regulations for interim status surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundments in &sect;265.228 (52 FR 8708, March 19, 1987, amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 57 FR 3493, Jan. 29, 1992) allow the option of closing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundment with the waste in place. This would mean that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several hundred thousands tons of untreated hazardous waste could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain indefinitely in an unlined impoundment immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjacent to and in hydraulic communication with the Calcasieu 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
River, several miles upstream from the Sabine National Wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Refuge. Hazardous waste constituents have already been detected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the groundwater collected and analyzed from monitoring wells 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the vicinity of the Surge Pond. EPA, the authorized state, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the company have worked out an arrangement whereby the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundment can be effectively closed and remediated, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludge securely disposed after treatment. Thus, the alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of closing in place appears to be clearly less desirable than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partial though substantial treatment of the sludge followed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of the treatment residue in a subtitle C MTR landfill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA supports the ongoing remediation plan, Citgo's choice to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close the pond by removal of hazardous waste, rather than closing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the waste in place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) As noted, Citgo's remediation plan has been approved by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ). LDEQ has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also approved a temporary variance to a small source exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for air emissions which establishes operating specifications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature and residence time for the portable thermal oxidizer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to destroy stripped volatile organics. Although regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval of the remediation plan was not required, EPA Region VI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurs with this proposed treatability variance and is currently reviewing Citgo's plan for risk based closure
of the Surge Pond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) EPA agrees that standards which could necessitate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offsite incineration are not appropriate for this waste, within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the meaning of &sect;268.44(a). The quantity of waste being generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by this remediation exceeds the available incineration capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for F037/F038 wastes. Although the national capacity variance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this waste has just expired, the fact remains that offsite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incineration is not logistically feasible for this large quantity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Citgo treatment system achieves oil recovery and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial treatment of some of the regulated constituents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citgo estimates that approximately 16 thousand tons of oil will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be recovered during the course of this remediation. Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimization is a high priority for the Agency and activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving recovery of valuable resources are strongly encouraged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Citgo treatment system achieves substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction of most of the regulated constituents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, EPA is proposing to grant the variance request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the treatment technology that is the basis for BDAT ``is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not appropriate to the waste'' under &sect;268.44 (a) and (h). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment technology is not appropriate because of the enormous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume of sludge needed to be treated and because requiring those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards to be met could result in a net environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detriment. (EPA is convinced that CITGO, for reasons that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legally permissible, will choose to close its impoundment with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundreds of thousands of tons of sludge left in place.) Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these exceptional circumstances, EPA believes that a treatability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance can be issued and accordingly is proposing to do so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA is proposing to grant Citgo a treatability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance for the F037/F038 wastes contained in and to be removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the Surge Pond, the company made a statement in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition with which the Agency does not agree. In particular, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency does not agree that the chemical properties of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste make thermal destuction inappropriate for this waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, EPA does not agree that the metal content of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste is sufficiently high to make the waste nonamenable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, it should be noted that wastewater from the sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment system is currently being put back in the Surge Pond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although characterization of this wastewater has not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided, this wastewater may contain significant concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of volatile organics which could simply evaporate from the pond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It may be possible to reduce releases of volatile organics from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wastewater to the air by treating this wastewater in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newly constructed closed-tank wastewater treatment system instead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the old system of open surface impoundments. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Final Listing Rule for F037/F038 established the Agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position that wastewater removed from wastewater treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludges by dewatering that is recycled to process operation or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned to the treatment system is not a ``derived from'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous wastes if it can be demonstrated that the water removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the sludge is no more contaminated than the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influent to the treatment unit from which the sludge was removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for dewatering (55 FR 46372, November 2, 1990). Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater from the sludge treatment system is excluded from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of hazardous waste and its management is not within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the jurisdiction of RCRA.

B. Proposed Alternative Treatment Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If this treatability variance is finalized, Citgo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation may renew the disposal of the treated sludge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by the onsite treatment system for sludges removed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Surge Pond at the Lake Charles Refinery site in a Subtitle C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous waste disposal facility (since it remains a hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste), subject to the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The stabilized sludge generated by the treatment system must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the F037/F038 nonwastewater treatment standards for benzene, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chromium, and nickel and the NESHAP standard for benzene prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal in a subtitle C regulated facility. Treatment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzene will also result in incidental treatment of volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organics in the waste. Meeting LDR and NESHAP standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzene should also assure optimized operation of the treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, since it is designed to treat benzene. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents that are normally regulated for F037/F038 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonwastewaters are not regulated for this waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) The vapor control system must be operated in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance specifications required by LDEQ, which state that the

thermal oxidizer fire box temperature shall be maintained at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1600
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system malfunctions, operation of the system must cease until the

generated by the onsite treatment system for sludges removed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Surge Pond at the Lake Charles Refinery site in a Subtitle C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous waste disposal facility, subject to the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The stabilized sludge generated by the treatment system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must meet the F037 and F038 nonwastewater treatment standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzene, chromium, and nickel and the NESHAP standard for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzene. Other constituents that are normally regulated in F037 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and F038 nonwastewaters are not regulated for this waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The vapor control system must be operated in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with performance specifications required by Louisiana Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Environmental Quality, which state that the thermal oxidizer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F or higher for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one second or more. If the vapor control system malfunctions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the system must cease until the problem has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected.

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 7 announces its intent to delete the Dupont County Road X23 Site,
Lee County, Iowa Site, from the National Priorities List (NPL), which constitutes Appendix B of the National Oil and
Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), and requests comments on this deletion. The EPA identifies
sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and maintains the NPL
as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous Substance
Response Fund (Fund). Pursuant to &sect;300.425(e)(3) of the National Contingency Plan (NCP), any site deleted
from the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions if future conditions at the site warrant such action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA will accept comments on its intention to delete this site from the NPL for thirty days after the publication
of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses the procedures
that the EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses how the site meets the deletion criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. NPL Deletion Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NCP establishes the criteria that EPA uses to delete sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR 300.425(e), sites
may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination, EPA, in consultation
with the State, will consider whether any of the following criteria have been met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Responsible parties or other persons have implemented all appropriate response actions required; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) All appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented and no further response action
by responsible parties is appropriate; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment
and, therefore, taking of remedial measures is not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 121(f)(1)(C) of CERCLA, and &sect;300.425(e)(2) of the NCP require State concurrence before deleting a
site from the NPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of a site from the NPL does not preclude eligibility for subsequent Fund-financed actions if future conditions
warrant such actions. Section 300.425(e)(3) of the NCP states: ``All releases deleted from the NPL are eligible for
further Fund-financed remedial actions should future conditions warrant such action. Whenever there is a significant
release from a site deleted from the NPL, the site shall be restored to the NPL, without application of the HRS [hazard
ranking system].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of sites from the NPL does not itself create, alter, or revoke any individual's rights or obligations. The
NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes and to assist Agency management. As mentioned in Section I of
this notice, &sect;300.425(e)(3) of the NCP makes clear that deletion of a site from the NPL does not preclude eligibility
for future Fund-financed response actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Deletion Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA Region 7 will accept and evaluate public comments before making the final decision to delete the site from the NPL.
The Agency believes that deletion procedures should focus on notice and comment at the local level. Comments from
the local community are likely to be the most pertinent to deletion decisions. The following procedures were used
for the intended deletion of the site: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. EPA Region 7 has recommended the deletion and prepared the relevant documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The State of Iowa has concurred with the deletion decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Concurrent with this National Notice of Intent to Delete a notice has been published in local and community newspapers
and has been distributed to appropriate federal, state, and local officials and other interested parties. This notice
announces a thirty (30) day public comment period on the deletion package, which starts two weeks from September 13,
1994 and which will conclude on September 29, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Region has made all relevant documents available in the Regional Office and local site information repository.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments received during the notice and comment period will be evaluated before the final decision to delete is
made. The Region will prepare a Responsiveness Summary, if necessary, which will address any comments received during
the public comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A deletion will occur after the Regional Administrator places a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The NPL will reflect any deletions in the next final update. Public notices and copies of the Responsiveness Summary
will be made available to local residents by Region 7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following summary provides the Agency's rationale for recommending deletion of the Dupont County Road X23, Lee
County, Iowa Site, from the NPL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DuPont County Road X23 Site is located near West Point, Lee County, Iowa. The site is comprised of two subsites,
the Baier and the McCarl subsites, located within one mile of each other on County Road X23. The Baier and McCarl subsites
are located within NE1/4, SW1/4, Section 28, Township 68 North, Range 5 West and SE1/4, SW1/4, Section 22 Township
68 North, Range 5 West, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DuPont contracted with Charles Knoch to haul and dispose of paint wastes from its Fort Madison plant during the period

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1949&hyph;53. (Following this DuPont contracted to have the waste taken to the Strunk Farm which was cleaned up voluntarily
in 1981 by DuPont.) DuPont estimates that 48,000 to 72,000 55-gallon drums of waste were disposed of at the two subsites.
The Baier subsite, owned at that time by Mr. Knoch's sister, was the primary disposal site. In inclement weather when
the Baier subsite was inaccessible, Mr. Knoch would use the McCarl subsite. The McCarl subsite was purchased by DuPont
in 1986 to prevent a home being built on the site.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The paint waste was placed in trenches and burned. DuPont estimates that as a result of incomplete burning 4,500 to
7,000 tons of ash might remain on the site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Baier site was listed as a potentially, uncontrolled, hazardous waste site in the Eckhardt Subcommittee Report
in November 1979. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The site was placed on the NPL with a hazard ranking System (HRS) score of 46.01 on August 30, 1990, 55 FR 169. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Preliminary Assessment (PA) of the Baier Farm was conducted in September 1980 by the U.S. EPA Field Investigative
Team (FIT). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Field Investigation of the Baier Farm was conducted by FIT in April 1983. Soil sample analysis found seven priority
pollutant metals in concentrations exceeding background (concentrations ranged from 90 to 18,000 ppm). Also detected
were six priority pollutant organics in soil samples (with concentrations up to 220,000 ppb). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 28, 1984, EPA sent an information request letter to DuPont regarding the waste site. DuPont's response indicated
another possible waste site at the McCarl property on Chalkridge Road. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July 1985 FIT oversaw the installation of three ground water monitoring wells at the Baier Site. Analyses of ground
water samples collected from the wells showed elevated levels of aluminum, barium, calcium, magnesium, potassium,
sodium, iron, manganese and lead. A second round of sampling of these wells in 1986 resulted in similar findings, with
chromium exceeding the Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) set forth in 40 CFR part 141. Downstream surface water samples
showed high concentrations of metals including lead and chromium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Preliminary Assessment for the McCarl subsite was conducted in January 1985 by the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FIT conducted the Site Investigation for the McCarl subsite in July 1986, including the installation and sampling
of three ground water monitoring wells. Analysis of soil samples from the investigation showed concentrations in
excess of background for barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, copper, manganese, selenium and zinc. Analysis of ground
water samples showed concentrations in excess of MCLs for antimony (32 times the MCL), cadmium, chromium, selenium.
Other metals were also detected. DuPont sampled the McCarl ground water wells in July 1988 and found higher levels
of selenium than found by FIT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Special Notice letter for RI/FS negotiations was sent to DuPont on January 31, 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order (UAO) to DuPont on July 5, 1989. The UAO required a removal action
at the Baier/Fedler subsite and an RI/FS for both subsites. The Removal Action was indefinitely deferred in February
7, 1990, in an amendment to the UAO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RI/FS activities were completed in January 1991. As part of the RI/FS a Baseline Risk Assessment was performed, based
on data from the RI, to evaluate the potential risks to human health posed by potential soil and ground water contamination
at the Site. An ecological risk assessment was prepared in conjunction with the Baseline Risk Assessment. Protective
concentrations of contaminants were established, based on residential exposure for both the average and reasonable
worst-case scenarios. Action levels (cleanup criteria) based on these exposure scenarios were then developed for
soils at the Site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Baseline Risk Assessment indicated that ground water contamination posed no threat to human health because of
the lack of a complete exposure pathway due to the lack of yield from the contaminated water bearing unit. Few receptor
wells exist in the Site vicinity. Furthermore, the nearby residential wells, sampled periodically, indicated that
metals and volatile organic compounds were below all regulatory health-based standards. The ``no-action'' alternative
was selected for ground water.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the completed RI/FS, the ROD was issued on May 28, 1991, and EPA successfully negotiated a Consent Decree (lodged
February 25, 1992, entered April 23, 1992, Case Number 3&hyph;92&hyph;CV&hyph;10028 in the United States District
Court, Southern District of Iowa, Davenport Division) for Remedial Design/Remedial Action (RD/RA) activities
with DuPont. DuPont completed the RA at the Site in September 1993. As required by the ROD, the RA included: (1) All surface
waste materials not amenable to the selected technology, such as metal, grinding balls, and paint cans, were to be
removed and disposed at an off-site RCRA-permitted hazardous waste landfill prior to stabilization/ solidification,

EPA in consultation with the State of Iowa, has determined that all fund-financed response activities under CERCLA
at the Dupont County Road X23 Site, Lee County, Iowa have been completed, and that no further response is necessary.
Therefore, it is proposed that the Site be deleted from the NPL.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to amend Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 206, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Door Locks and Door Retention Components
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, by extending and expanding the standard's existing side door requirements to the back doors of passenger cars and
multipurpose passenger vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 4,536 kilograms (kg) (10,000 pounds
(lb)) or less, including hatchbacks, station wagons, sport utility vehicles, and passenger vans. The purpose of
the standard's requirements, which currently apply only to side doors, is to reduce the likelihood of occupants being
ejected from vehicles in real-world crashes. A recent agency study indicates that each year there are nearly 150 fatalities
in which an occupant is ejected through rear hatches, tailgates, and other back doors of these vehicles. This proposal
seeks to reduce the number of fatalities and serious injuries resulting from such ejections by extending and expanding
Standard No. 206's requirements for door locks and door retention components to back doors. Given the differences
between side doors and back doors, the agency is proposing minor modifications in the performance requirements and
test procedures to make them appropriate for back doors.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Existing Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard No. 206, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Door Locks and Door Retention Components
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, specifies performance requirements for side door locks and side door retention components, including latches,
hinges, and other supporting means. The requirements are intended to minimize the likelihood of occupant ejections
from the vehicle in the event of a crash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard's full requirements apply to side doors other than cargo-type doors and sliding doors; more abbreviated
requirements apply to the latter two types of doors. The standard's full requirements can be summarized as follows.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, each door latch and striker assembly must have a fully latched position and a secondary latch position. The
secondary position serves as a backup to the primary latched position in the event the primary latch is not properly
engaged and adds an additional level of protection in case the primary latch position fails. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, latches and hinges must withstand specified load requirements. A door latch and striker assembly of a side
door, when in the fully latched position, must not separate when a longitudinal load of 11,000 Newtons (2,500 pounds),
or a transverse load of 8,900 Newtons (2,000 pounds), is applied to the latch (``Longitudinal'' loads are parallel
to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline and are applied perpendicular to the face of the latch. ``Transverse''
loads are perpendicular to the vehicle centerline and are applied in the direction in which the door opens). Reduced
load requirements are specified for the secondary latched position. Also, a door latch must not disengage from the
fully latched position when specified inertia loads are applied to the door latch system (Inertia is the property
of matter that requires that a load be exerted on a body to accelerate it. An inertial load is calculated by multiplying
the mass of a body by its acceleration). Door hinges must not separate when specified longitudinal and transverse
loads are applied to the hinge system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, side doors must be equipped with a locking mechanism with an operating means in the interior of the vehicle.
For side front door locks, the outside door handle must be inoperative when the locking mechanism is engaged. For side
rear door locks, both the outside and inside door handles must be inoperative when the locking mechanism is engaged.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard No. 206 specifies test procedures for many of its performance requirements. The standard incorporates
test procedures set forth in two Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) recommended practices: SAE J839b, Passenger
Car Side Door Latch Systems, and SAE J934, Vehicle Passenger Door Hinge Systems.

B. April 1990 Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of its review of potential back door safety problems, NHTSA conducted an in-depth accident analysis using
1982&hyph;1986 and 1988 (no national data file for 1987) National Accident Sampling System (NASS) data relating
to door openings and ejections in passenger vehicles involved in crashes that required towing from the scene (hereinafter
referred to as towaway crashes). In addition, the 1988 Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) data were used to assess
the magnitude of the safety problem. The results of these analyses were published on April 5, 1990 in a report entitled
``Hatchback, Tailgate, and Back Door Opening in Crashes and Occupant Ejection through the Back Area'' (1990 Report).
A copy of this report is available in NHTSA Docket 90&hyph;08&hyph;GR&hyph;001. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The report concluded that back doors of vehicles so equipped open in 5&hyph;6 percent of towaway crashes, compared
to 1&hyph;2 percent of side doors in such crashes. Further, a hatchback or tailgate was about 3 times as likely to open
as one of the front side doors and about 7&hyph;8 times as likely to open as one of the rear side doors. Of passenger vehicles
so equipped, an estimated 36,244 hatchbacks and tailgates opened in towaway crashes in 1988. More specifically,
an estimated 4,986 passenger van back doors opened in towaway crashes, representing about 4 times the rate of front
side door openings and about double the rate of right rear side door openings (very few passenger vans have left side
rear doors). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the data showed that 53 percent of the back door openings occurred in accidents involving vehicle rollovers,
as opposed to 23 percent of left front door openings and 40 percent of right front door openings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the frequency of back door openings, however, occupant ejection through the back door occurred in only 1 percent
of the towaway crashes involving back door openings. This compares with 8 to 13 percent of occupant ejections through
front door openings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FARS data indicated that there were 8,343 passenger car and MPV occupant ejection fatalities in 1988, 2,190 of which
were from vehicles with back doors. NHTSA's report set forth two methodologies, both using NASS data, to estimate
the number of these fatalities that represented occupant ejections through back doors. One methodology resulted
in an estimate that 93 of the fatally injured persons were ejected through back doors. The other methodology estimated
the number to be 130. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also on April 5, 1990, NHTSA wrote to nine manufacturers (Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Toyota,
Volkswagen, and Volvo) asking their thoughts on how to address the problem of back door openings and requesting information
on design specifications used for the production of back door latch/lock systems. Eight of the nine responded, indicating
that none of their back door latch assemblies, except certain Mazda vehicles, met the requirements of Standard No.
206. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They stated that they did not consider back door openings to be a significant safety problem, however, and indicated
that they had certain design guidelines and requirements that are followed in designing their back door latch assemblies.
Finally, they stated that proper use of seat belts is the most effective method of ejection reduction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 19, 1990, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety petitioned the agency to, among other things, extend
the requirements of Standard 206 to back doors. NHTSA denied this petition in a document published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 48261) on November 20, 1990, citing the 1990 Report in its denial. NHTSA concluded that increased use of seat
belts would be a more effective means of reducing back door ejections than extending the requirements of Standard
206 to back doors, and that there was not a safety need significant enough to justify the recommended rulemaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA continued to evaluate the issue of preventing back door ejections and on January 21, 1994, issued an update to
the 1990 Report. The updated report is entitled ``Door Opening and Occupant Ejection through Rear Hatches, Tailgates,
and Other Back Doors'' (1994 Report). The agency published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 3925) on January 27, 1994, requesting public review and comment on this report. This report is available in Docket
No. 90&hyph;06&hyph;No.3&hyph;001.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NASS and FARS data from 1988&hyph;1992 were utilized for this report. Based on an analysis of those data, the report
estimated that each year there are 147 fatalities in which occupants are ejected through rear hatches, tailgates
and other back doors. The data also showed that approximately 95 percent of the victims were not secured by seat belts
and that approximately 10 percent of those victims were children under 10 years of age. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In towaway crashes, rollovers accounted for 35 percent of left front door openings, 40 percent of right front door
openings, and 42 percent of back door openings. Also, the data showed that the most common damage associated with door
openings was damage to the latch and striker assemblies. This was true for 60 percent of opened left front doors, 50
percent of opened right front doors, and 71 percent of opened back doors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments were received in response to NHTSA's January 1994 notice. The American Automobile Manufacturers
Association (AAMA) stated that the report showed a low rate of passenger ejection through back doors, and contended
that the data again demonstrate that the most effective means of preventing back door ejections is through the proper
use of safety belts. AAMA encouraged NHTSA's efforts in promoting the use of safety belts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) agreed that a high percentage of vehicle ejections occur because
of lack of use or improper use of safety belts. Nevertheless, Advocates believes that back doors are opening at an unacceptable
rate. To address this problem, Advocates suggested that NHTSA should take multiple actions. That organization stated
that NHTSA should look at the fundamental character of latch/striker designs in addition to increasing latch/striker
strength. Further, Advocates stated that NHTSA should address the current roof strength and side impact standards
as they relate to latch/striker integrity. Finally, Advocates stated that because rear seat belts in some vehicles
are insufficient to assure ready availability to occupants, NHTSA should address that issue as well as evaluate how
rear seats themselves are attached in MPVs.

and Ray Gold of the Center for Auto Safety. They stated that the sum of injuries and fatalities from back door ejections
would approach 1,000 per year. They attached two case studies of back door ejections. These commenters suggested
that the Standard No. 206 test be changed, that the standard be extended to back doors, that laminated glass should
be used for all fixed windows, that side and roof strength for vehicles with high centers of gravity should be improved,
and that back door structures have dynamic integrity.

II. Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overall Proposal and Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of the number of fatalities that are occurring as a result of back door ejections, NHTSA has decided to propose
extending and expanding Standard No. 206's side door requirements to the back doors of passenger cars and multipurpose
passenger vehicles (MPVs) with a GVWR of 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) or less, including hatchbacks, station wagons, sport
utility vehicles, and passenger vans. Given the differences between side doors and back doors in the orientation
of their hinges and latches in relation to the vehicle, the agency is proposing modifications to the test requirements/procedures
to make them appropriate for back doors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has previously concluded that Standard No. 206's requirements have been effective in reducing side door ejections.
In November 1989, the agency published ``An Evaluation of Door Locks and Roof Crush Resistance of Passenger Cars_Federal
Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 206 and 216 (DOT HS 806 489).'' The study concluded that door latch improvements in
passenger cars implemented during 1963&hyph;68 save an estimated 400 lives per year, reducing the risk of ejection
in rollover crashes by 15 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that extending the existing requirements of Standard No. 206 to back doors would make an additional
contribution toward reducing injuries and perhaps fatalities caused by back door ejections. The agency recognizes
that the increased use of seat belts is also an effective means of addressing this problem. However, despite continuing
efforts by NHTSA, state and local governments, safety organizations, manufacturers and others to promote safety
belt use, fatalities resulting from the ejection of unbelted occupants remain a serious safety problem. Therefore,
while the agency recognizes the importance of continuing efforts to increase safety belt use, it now believes that
an extension and expansion of Standard No. 206's requirements to back doors is appropriate as well. The agency also
believes that, given the increasing popularity of vehicles with back doors, especially vans, this safety problem
may become more serious unless action is taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also notes that the agency is in the process of conducting additional research examining the potential for improving
vehicle latch performance. While that research may lead to a future upgrade of Standard No. 206, the agency does not
believe it should delay the application of the standard's existing and/or modified requirements to back doors in
the interim. The agency believes that the back door ejection problem warrants immediate attention. Compliance should
not present any significant problems since the manufacturers are familiar with the design changes needed, as they
apply to back door latches to meet Standard No. 206's current requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the differences between side doors and back doors, NHTSA believes that some minor modifications in Standard
No. 206's test requirements and procedures are needed for back doors. Of particular note are the differences in the
orientation of hinges and latches in relation to the vehicle and in the variety of designs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The difference in orientation is significant because the requirements and procedures specified for longitudinal
loading of latches and hinges differ from those specified for transverse loading of those components. If all back
doors were just like side doors except for their location on the back of the vehicle, the longitudinal and transverse
directions of the loading would simply be reversed with respect to the latches and hinges of back doors. However, all
back doors are not just like side doors, thus the establishment of appropriate test requirements and procedures for
these doors is somewhat more complicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is considerably greater variety in the design of rear doors than side doors. Side doors almost always open to
the side and most have hinges on their front edges and latches on their rear edges. Rear doors may open upward, downward
or sideways, and have latches and hinges on the top, bottom or side. Moreover, while side doors are generally vertical,
when viewed in a front or back view, rear doors may be vertical or sloped (as in the case of many hatchbacks), when viewed
in a side view.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency notes that there are a number of different designs for rear doors and for their installation. Four typical
back doors used in production vehicles are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Door opens upward, with latch (or striker) at the bottom center of the door with a single striker (or latch) on the
back floor panel or door sill;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Door opens sideways, with striker located at the center of the back side frame and latch located at the side edge
of the door (for example, back doors of large station wagons); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Split doors with top, usually glass, opening upward and bottom tailgate opening downward, with striker at the
bottom of the top glass door and latches or rod/pin connectors at top and sides of the tailgate (for example, back doors
of sport utility vehicles); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Double cargo-type doors, a two-part door that latches to itself with one latch located at the center between the
doors (for example, back doors of some passenger vans). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is possible that other door designs, such as sliding back doors, may be used in future production vehicles. Therefore,
the agency must also include the sliding back door in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the wide variety of back door designs and latch and hinge orientations, NHTSA believes it is desirable to specify
back door load test requirements in terms of the latch and hinge rather than in terms of longitudinal and transverse
vehicle orientation. In addition, given the nature of the loading that back door latches and hinges are likely to experience
in the event of a side impact to the rear quarter panel of a vehicle, NHTSA believes it is appropriate to require latches
and hinges on doors that open upward to meet load requirements in three rather than two directions.

Requirements for Secondary Latch Position
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard No. 206 requires, for hinged side doors other than cargo-type doors, that each door latch and striker assembly
must be provided with a fully latched position and a secondary latched position. Load tests are specified for each
position. As previously indicated, the secondary position serves as a backup to the primary latched position in the
event the primary is not properly engaged and adds an additional level of protection in case the primary latch position
fails. The requirement for a secondary latch position does not apply to hinged cargo-type doors or sliding doors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of proposing to extend Standard No. 206 to back doors, NHTSA is considering applying the requirement for a secondary
latch position to some or all back doors. The agency requests comments on which types of back doors should be included/excluded
from this requirement and why.

2. Load Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard No. 206 specifies three load requirements for hinged side doors: longitudinal load, transverse load, and
inertia load. The standard specifies differing load requirements for the fully latched and secondary latched positions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Load Test One. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SAE J839 indicates that the purpose of the longitudinal load test for side doors is to determine the ability of the vehicle
latch and striker to withstand a test load perpendicular to the face of the latch. The test procedure states that the
specified load (11,000 Newtons (2,500 pounds) when in the fully latched position and 4,450 Newtons (1,000 pounds)
when in the secondary latched position) is applied perpendicular to the face of the latch. NHTSA is proposing to apply
the same basic test requirement and procedure to back doors. For back doors, however, the agency is proposing to use
the term ``Load Test One'' for this requirement, instead of ``longitudinal load,'' since the latter term would be
inappropriate given the orientation of most back door latches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Load Test Two. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SAE J839 indicates that the purpose of the transverse load test for side doors is to determine the ability of the vehicle
latch and striker to withstand the test load in the direction of door opening. The test procedure states that the specified
load (8,900 Newtons (2,000 pounds) when in the fully latched position and 4,450 Newtons (1,000 pounds) when in the
secondary latched position) is applied in the direction of the door opening. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to apply a corresponding test requirement/procedure to back doors. To ensure that this second
load test requirement is not redundant and that latches can meet load requirements in various directions (as may occur
in real world crashes), the agency is specifying that the load for this test is applied in the direction of the fork-bolt
opening and parallel to the plane of the latch face. A depiction of the fork-bolt and the loading direction is given
in Figure 1. For most latches, this will be in the same direction as the door opening. The agency is proposing to specify
the term ``Load Test Two'' for this test requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Load Test Three. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated above, given the nature of the loading that back door latches and hinges are likely to experience in the
event of a side impact to the rear quarter panel of a vehicle, NHTSA believes it is appropriate to require latches on
doors that open upward to meet load requirements in three rather than two directions, i.e., directions that correspond
to the longitudinal and transverse directions for side doors, and a third direction that is orthogonal to the other
two directions. The agency is therefore proposing a third load test requirement in which a load would be applied in
a direction orthogonal to the directions specified in Load Tests One and Two (i.e., perpendicular to both of those
directions). The test set-up for Load Tests Two and Three is identical. However, the latch in Load Test Three is mounted
in a position perpendicular to that in Load Tests One and Two. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that, as indicated above, Standard No. 206 specifies, for the fully latched position, an 11,000 Newton
(2,500 pound) load for the longitudinal load test and an 8,900 Newton (2,000 pound) load for the transverse load test.
In proposing to extend the requirements to back doors, the agency is proposing the same loads as for the corresponding
Load Tests One and Two. The agency is considering whether an 11,000 Newton (2,500 pound) load or an 8,900 Newton (2,000
pound) load should apply to Load Test Three and requests comments on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inertia Load. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard No. 206 requires that a side door latch not disengage from the fully latched position when a longitudinal
or transverse inertia load of 30g is applied to the door latch system. While the standard's procedures for the other
load requirements specify actual loading of a door latch in a test, mathematical analysis is specified for the inertia
load requirement. The agency notes that while Standard No. 206 only specifies that the inertia load requirement must
be met for longitudinal and transverse loads, SAE 839b recommends that the 30g requirement be met ``in any direction.''
The agency believes that this requirement should be met by back doors in any direction, since many latch orientations
are possible for back doors. NHTSA believes that this would best ensure adequate latch performance in the many loading
conditions experienced during real world crashes. The agency specifically requests comments on the appropriateness
of requiring latches to meet the inertia load requirement in any direction, as opposed to a limited number of directions,
such as those specified for Load Tests One, Two and Three. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Door Hinges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard No. 206 specifies that door hinges must support the door and may not separate when a longitudinal load of 11,000
Newtons (2,500 pounds), or a transverse load of 8,900 Newtons (2,000 pounds), is applied. The same considerations
concerning longitudinal and transverse loads discussed above with respect to latches apply to rear door hinges.
Therefore, the agency is proposing to specify the following three load tests: Load Test One_load is applied in the
direction perpendicular to the hinge face plate; Load Test Two_load is applied in the direction perpendicular to
the axis of the hinge pin and parallel to the hinge face plate; Load Test Three_load is applied in the direction of the
axis of the hinge pin. The third test is proposed for hinges on doors that open upward. The agency is considering whether
an 11,000 Newton (2,500 pound) load or an 8,900 Newton (2,000 pound) load should be specified for these three tests
and requests comments on this issue.

D. Door Locks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard No. 206 specifies that side doors must be equipped with a locking mechanism with an operating means in the
interior of the vehicle. For locks in side front doors, the outside door handle must be inoperative when the locking
mechanism is engaged. For side rear door locks, both the outside and inside door handles must be inoperative when the
locking mechanism is engaged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes that many production vehicles do not have a true ``locking mechanism'' on their back doors and
provide no inside door handles. In many cases, unlatching can not be performed by occupants seated near such doors.
As part of proposing to extend Standard No. 206 to back doors, NHTSA is considering applying door lock requirements
to some or all back doors. The agency requests comments on whether the requirements for side front door locks or side
rear door locks should be extended to back doors, which types of back doors should be included/excluded from this requirement,
and why. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Leadtime 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing an effective date of the first September 1 that occurs following a two year period beginning
with publication of a final rule. NHTSA believes that a leadtime of about two years is needed, since manufacturers
will need to make design and tooling changes for many of their passenger cars and MPVs. The agency believes that a longer
leadtime would be unnecessary, since manufacturers are already familiar with the kinds of designs needed to comply
with the requirements of Standard No. 206. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Additional Considerations and Questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given the wide variety of passenger car and MPV designs, both with respect to the back door latch itself and with respect
to passenger access to the back door, NHTSA recognizes that there may be a number of issues concerning whether some
of the proposed requirements should apply to only certain back doors and whether any additional modifications need
to be made in the test requirements and procedures to make them appropriate for all covered vehicles. The agency specifically
requests comments on the following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. As discussed above, the full requirements of Standard No. 206 apply only to hinged side doors other than cargo-type
doors; abbreviated requirements apply to hinged cargo-type doors and to sliding doors. To what extent should full
versus abbreviated requirements apply to back doors? Are there any back doors, such as split back doors, to which the
requirements should not apply at all? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Are the proposed test requirements adequately clear and appropriate for all back doors? For example, are latch
faces and hinge faces designed so that the direction perpendicular to these components can readily be determined?
Commenters who believe that some of proposed requirements are not adequately clear are encouraged to suggest specific
changes to clarify the procedures. Depending on the comments, the agency may make changes in the procedures in a final
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Identify which and how many of your current passenger car hatchbacks, station wagons, sport utility vehicles,
and vans would need to be upgraded to meet the proposed requirements for: (a) latching mechanisms; (b) hinges, and
(c) locks? Please indicate the consumer cost to upgrade and the relative increase in strength or other benefit for
each upgrade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Identify which and how many of your current passenger car hatchbacks, station wagons, sport utility vehicles,
and vans would pass the proposed requirements for: (a) latching mechanisms, (b) hinges, and (c) locks? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Please identify and/or provide any studies or data that might assist the agency in quantifying the safety or other
benefits of this proposed rulemaking action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Costs and Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments to Standard No. 206 would affect back door locks and door retention components on passenger
car hatchbacks, station wagons, utility vehicles, and vans. About 1.5 million hatchbacks, 0.4 million station wagons,
1.6 million utility vehicles, and 1.8 million vans are expected to be produced in the 1997 model year, for a total of
about 5.3 million vehicles that would potentially be affected by the proposed amendments in this notice, if they are
required on a proposed effective date before September 1, 1997.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In an evaluation of back door latches in minivans (docket No. 94&hyph;70&hyph;N01), the agency conducted repeat
tests of 8 latches from different minivans in accordance with the testing procedures of Standard No. 206. Those 8 latches
represented vehicle sales of about 1 million vehicles in 1993. One of the tested latches failed the proposed Load Test
Two requirement and another failed the proposed Load Test One requirement. All the others exceeded those load requirements,
some passing by a margin of 125 percent in the Load Test Two direction and 90 percent in the Load Test One direction. The
6 complying latches represent about 50 percent (0.5 million) of the 1993 minivan sales. It is reasonable to conclude,
therefore, that approximately half of the minivan fleet already meets or exceeds the requirements proposed in this
notice. NHTSA has not tested the back door latch mechanisms of hatchbacks, station wagons and utility vehicles. Given
the data obtained from the minivan tests, however, and considering that most of the 1.6 million sport utility vehicles
have back door latch systems that are similar to those on minivans, the agency believes that about 50 percent (0.8 million)
of sport utility vehicles would also meet the requirements proposed in this notice. Although many additional vehicles
may also comply, the agency has conservatively assumed that all of the vehicles other than half the minivan and half
the sport utility vehicle fleets may require some modification to meet the proposed requirements. That leaves the
total number of affected vehicles at approximately 4.0 million. Although those vehicles could require some upgrading
of their current back door locks and door retention components, these proposed amendments are expected to require
not more than 1 or 2 minor to moderate changes in either latching, hinge, or locking mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating the costs of the 8 minivan latches tested, the agency compared the production costs of a failing latch
and a passing latch, which were $3.87 and $2.81 respectively. Thus, the cost of the superior latch was about $1.00 less
than that of the failing latch. The agency also examined the retail costs of the 8 latches tested, which ranged from
$22.03 to $81.74. The costs of the 2 failing latches were $23.52 and $63.19. The tests demonstrated, therefore, that
a latch that meets the requirements of Standard No. 206 need not be more expensive than one that does not. Other factors,
such as design features and materials used, could significantly affect the costs of latches. Given the assumption
that no more than 4.0 million vehicles may require upgrades because of the proposed requirements of this notice, and
that the cost of an upgrade is not necessarily higher than the cost of current designs, NHTSA has concluded that the
cost of extending the current requirements of Standard No. 206 to back doors would be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed compliance tests for back door locks and door retention components typically would be conducted with similar
but at times slightly modified test equipment of the type that is currently used to evaluate side door locks and retention
components. Thus, no significant test equipment costs should be incurred by manufacturers. Compliance testing
costs should also be similar to that for side doors, about $110. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, about 147 deaths and 740 injuries occur each year that involve occupant ejection through back doors. The
amendments proposed in this notice should provide some benefits in reducing these deaths and injuries since over
80 percent of these ejection accidents involve hinge or latch damage and these components would be upgraded. However,
at this time, the agency is not able to quantify these benefits or costs with sufficient precision to determine the
cost effectiveness of this proposed rulemaking action. In this notice, the agency is seeking data and comments that
should allow more precise estimates to be made.

IV. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices

A. E.O. 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice has not been reviewed under EO 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The agency has considered the
impact of this rulemaking action and has concluded that it is not ``significant'' under the DOT's Regulatory Policies
and Procedures. Since the amendments in this notice are primarily an extension of the present passenger vehicle side
door latch, hinge, and lock requirements to include the back doors of passenger motor vehicles with a GVWR of 4,536
kg (10,000 lb) or less, the agency believes that any necessary minor to moderate hardware changes can be readily incorporated
into back door designs within the leadtime provided, with very little or no economic impact. Given the lack of significant
industry impact and minor economic significance of this rulemaking, a Preliminary Regulator Evaluation is not considered
necessary and has not been prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify
that the proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Accordingly, the agency has not prepared a preliminary regulatory flexibility analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that few, if any, motor vehicle manufacturers qualify as small businesses. Therefore, small
businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units would be affected by this rulemaking only to the extent
that they may pay very slightly more for the vehicles that they purchase with the qualifying back door latches and hinges.

D. E.O. 12612, Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612 and has determined
that the proposals in this notice do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. No state laws would be affected.

E. Civil Justice Reform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed amendments would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103(b), whenever a Federal motor
vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state or political subdivision of a state may prescribe or continue in effect
a standard applicable to the same aspect of performance of a motor vehicle only if the standard is identical to the Federal
standard. However, the United States Government, a state or political subdivision of a state may prescribe a standard
for a motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment obtained for its own use that imposes a higher performance requirement
than that required by the Federal standard. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules
establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. A petition for reconsideration or other
administrative proceedings is not required before parties may file suit in court.

V. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the amendments proposed in this rulemaking action. It is requested
but not required that any comments be submitted in 10 copies each. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments must not exceed 15 pages in length (49 CFR 553.21). This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to
detail their primary arguments in concise fashion. Necessary attachments, however, may be appended to those comments
without regard to the 15-page limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, 3 copies of the complete submission
including the purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA at
the street address shown above, and 7 copies from which the purportedly confidential information has been deleted
should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter setting
forth the information specified in 49 CFR 512, the agency's confidential business information regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments received on or before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the proposal
will be considered, and will be available to the public for examination in the docket at the above address both before
and after the closing date. To the extent possible, comments received after the closing date will be considered. Comments
received too late for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking
action. Comments on the proposal will be available for public inspection in the docket. NHTSA will continue to file
relevant information in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue
to monitor the docket for new material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed
stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments the docket supervisor will return
the postcard by mail.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Parish's alkali grass is an ephemeral, annual species that occurs in small, widely disjunct populations in California,
Arizona, and New Mexico. Its habitat is desert seeps and springs. The grass is threatened by alteration of hydrologic
flows due to spring or seep development, water diversion or impoundment, and groundwater pumping; loss of habitat
from farming, grazing, and residential construction activities; limited distribution; and low population numbers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 28, 1994, the Service published a proposed rule to list the Parish's alkali grass as endangered under the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended. Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Act requires that a public hearing be held if requested within
45 days of the proposal's publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A public hearing request was received within the allotted time period from Mr. Ron Wood, Kingman, Arizona.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has scheduled this hearing at 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. (Mountain Daylight Time), September 15, 1994, at the
Greyhills High School, Tuba City, Arizona. Anyone wishing to make an oral statement for the record is encouraged to
provide a written copy of their statement to be presented to the Service at the start of the hearing. In the event there
is a large attendance, the time allotted for oral statements may have to be limited. Oral and written statements receive
equal consideration. There are no limits to the length of written comments presented at this hearing or mailed to the
Service. Legal notice announcing the dates, time, and location of the hearing are being published in newspapers concurrently
with this

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 18, 1988, Congress enacted the Shore Protection Act (33 U.S.C. 2601, Public Law 100&hyph;688, 102 Stat.
4139 hereinafter referred to as ``SPA'') to minimize trash, medical debris and other unsightly and potentially harmful
materials from being deposited into the coastal waters of the United States as a result of inadequate waste handling
procedures by vessels transporting wastes on U.S. coastal waters and associated loading and off-loading facilities.
SPA is Title IV, Subtitle A of P.L. 100&hyph;688. The Congressional Conference Report on P.L. 100&hyph;688 stated
that landfills and their attendant barging operations are a major source of floatable waste in harbor areas. The report
concluded that this type of waste has fouled the beaches of this country on several occasions, reducing the quality
of coastal waters, endangering the health of humans, marine mammals, waterfowl and fish, and causing severe declines
in coastal economies dependent upon tourism and recreational uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4102 of SPA, titled Vessel Permits and Numbers, establishes that a vessel may not transport municipal or commercial
waste in coastal waters without: (1) A permit from the Secretary of Transportation; and (2) displaying a number or
other marking as prescribed by the Secretary under Chapter 123 of Section 12502(b) of Title 46, United States Code.
The Department of Transportation (DOT) has promulgated an interim regulation on vessel permitting and vessel numbering
system (33 CFR part 151, subpart B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4103(a) of SPA requires owners and operators of waste sources, vessels transporting waste and waste receiving
facilities to take all reasonable steps to minimize the amount of municipal or commercial waste deposited into coastal
waters both during vessel loading and unloading operations, and during vessel transportation from a waste source
to a receiving facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and DOT have been given authority to implement certain provisions of SPA. DOT is responsible for issuing permits
to the appropriate vessels and for prescribing the number or marking which the vessel must display under section 4102
of SPA. EPA is responsible for developing the regulations, in consultation with DOT, which prescribe waste handling
practices pursuant to section 4103(b) of SPA. This proposed rule, when promulgated, will fulfill EPA's obligation
under SPA section 4103(b). DOT is responsible for enforcing SPA, although the Secretary of Transportation may authorize
other officers or employees of the United States Government to enforce provisions of SPA under title 14 U.S.C. 89.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary of Transportation has designated the United States Coast Guard (USCG) as the lead entity in implementing
SPA on DOT's behalf. Vessel permits under SPA are issued by the USCG in accordance with 33 CFR part 151, subpart B. Under
Sections 4102(d), (e) and 4104(a) of SPA, EPA has a consultation role on USCG permits and can request that the USCG deny,
suspend or revoke a permit. Specifically, SPA section 4102(d) provides that DOT (USCG) and EPA can deny a permit if
the owner or operator of a vessel has a record indicating a pattern of serious violations of any of the following statutes:
The Shore Protection Act (33 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.); The Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.); The Marine
Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.); The Rivers and Harbors Appropriation
Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401 et seq.); or The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). SPA directs
the USCG to provide a hearing process for denial, suspension or revocation of a permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing these regulations to set waste handling practices for municipal and commercial waste transported
in U.S. coastal waters. SPA permits will require the permittee to comply with these EPA regulations when they are promulgated
in final form.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rules draw on experience from the State of New York (6 NYCRR Part 360, Solid Waste Management Facilities
Document for Solid Waste and Semi-solid Waste Handling Practices), and from the State of Louisiana (Regulation 29&hyph;B,
section pertaining to permitting of vessels that haul municipal and commercial waste). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USCG has issued interim final regulations which prescribe permit application requirements for SPA permits (33
CFR part 151). The regulations proposed today are designed to work in concert with the USCG permit regulations to implement
SPA. These regulations apply in addition to, and not in lieu of, all applicable requirements under any other statutes.

II. Detailed Discussion of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 237.1, as proposed, essentially restates the regulatory authority given to EPA under section 4103(b) of
SPA. It requires EPA to prescribe regulations that provide methods to minimize waste deposits into coastal waters
during loading, offloading, and transport. It provides for the development and submission, as appropriate, of an
Operation and Maintenance manual that will identify procedures to prevent, report and clean up deposits of waste
and keep records. Moreover, it allows the Administrator to require owners or operators of waste sources, vessels,
and receiving facilities to operate a tracking system if the Administrator determines them necessary to assure adequate
compliance with SPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except for those exemptions described below, these proposed regulations apply to all owners and operators of vessels
transporting municipal or commercial waste in coastal waters; waste sources from which municipal or commercial
waste is loaded onto a vessel in coastal waters; and receiving facilities to which municipal or commercial waste is
offloaded from a vessel in coastal waters. Coastal waters is defined in the statute (SPA section 4101(2)) and in proposed
&sect;237.3(b). Where there is ambiguity on the applicability of SPA, we are providing clarification below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;237.2 states that the rule would apply to vessels which transport municipal or commercial waste in
coastal waters. Owners or operators of these vessels are required, among other things, to obtain permits from the
USCG, and to assure that any deposit of waste into coastal waters from the vessel during transport is minimized. The
preamble to the USCG's interim permitting regulations states that a vessel which regularly transports miscellaneous
cargo in coastal waters but is hired to transport municipal or commercial waste for a specific voyage is required to
have a permit to transport the municipal or commercial waste for that voyage. A SPA permit and compliance with waste
handling requirements of this rule (when finalized) are required of the vessel where the predominant business or
purpose of the vessel 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
for that voyage 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is transportation of municipal or commercial waste (54 FR 22546, 22547, May 24, 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing this regulation, EPA has worked with the USCG to identify vessels that have applied for SPA permits.
In doing so, it became clear that there are vessels currently transporting municipal and commercial waste that have
not applied for a permit under the USCG permitting requirements. For example, EPA is aware of a number of vessels that
support the offshore oil and gas industry by transporting packaged garbage, drilling fluids, and drill cuttings
from oil and gas platforms and developed and undeveloped lease blocks in coastal waters to shore for disposal. EPA
believes that these vessels fall within the scope of SPA because they are transporting commercial waste in coastal
waters. Therefore, EPA believes that vessels which are used, contracted, or hired to transport oil field municipal
and commercial waste from offshore development and production facilities to shore reception facilities, commonly
referred to as ``supply vessels,'' are required to comply with these regulations, when promulgated in final form.
After consulting with the USCG, the agency has been informed that the USCG believes that these ``supply vessels''
are also subject to the permitting requirements under 33 CFR part 151, subpart B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vessels used, contracted or hired for the purpose of pumping sewage from other vessels are also covered by these regulations.
The Agency considered excluding these pump-out vessels from the universe of regulated entities to encourage their
use, but concluded that the requirements imposed by these regulations are minimal, and should not discourage the
use of pump-out vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Vessels Excluded

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4102(a) of SPA clearly exempts public vessels from this regulation. Section 237.2(b)(1), as proposed, supports
this exemption by restating that these regulations do not apply to such vessels (as defined in 33 CFR 151.1006). ``Public
vessels'' are defined as vessels that are owned or demise chartered and operated by the United States government or
a government of a foreign country and are not engaged in commercial service. SPA states that vessels as defined in section
2101 of title 46 of the United States Code are not required to apply for a SPA permit to transport municipal or commercial
waste in coastal waters or comply with this rule. Note that a public vessel would not include a vessel owned by a municipality.

In addition, these proposed regulations would not apply to vessels which transport some quantity of municipal or
commercial waste incidental to the predominant business or purpose of the vessel. For example, a ferry transporting
people and vehicles which also transports a garbage truck loaded with municipal or commercial waste is not required
to apply for a SPA permit and would be exempt from complying with this rule. In this example, the ferry's predominant
business or purpose is not waste transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conference report on P.L. 100&hyph;688 states that SPA was intended ``only to apply to vessels whose purpose is
the transportation of municipal or commercial waste, not all vessels. It was not intended to apply to vessels that
may generate waste during their `normal operations'.'' Examples of vessels exempt from this rule because of the normal
operation exemption would be a cruise ship and a fishing vessel, both of which transport waste generated by the crew
and passengers during a voyage. This ``normal operation'' exemption is set forth in section 4101(3)(B) of SPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If normal operational waste meeting the definition of municipal or commercial waste is transferred from the generating
vessel to another vessel contracted to transport waste, the vessel receiving the municipal or commercial waste is
subject to the requirements of SPA as a vessel and receiving facility and must comply with requirements under these
regulations when finalized. The waste generating vessel is not regulated under SPA. This clarification allows vessels,
such as cruise ships and fishing vessels, to offload their normal operational waste without being subject to SPA requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SPA section 4103(a)(1) requires owners or operators of waste sources to take all reasonable steps to assure that all
municipal or commercial waste is loaded onto a vessel in a manner that assures that waste deposited into coastal waters
is minimized. There are a variety of entities that handle municipal or commercial waste that are considered waste
sources for purposes of these regulations. These include trucks, certain vessels, waste transfer stations, and
island docks or piers. The following provides some examples of how and when this regulation applies to some of these
waste sources. Offshore oil and gas exploration platforms will not be considered waste sources under SPA, for the
reasons set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A truck transporting municipal or commercial waste will be considered a waste source (i.e., rolling stock or motor
vehicle) if it directly loads its waste onto a vessel. If a truck will be transferring municipal or commercial waste
to a vessel by means of a waste transfer station, EPA is proposing in &sect;237.2(b)(4) that the truck not be considered
a waste source, and therefore not be subject to the requirements of these regulations on its own. Instead, the waste
transfer station would be considered the waste source responsible for ensuring that the waste transfer meets the
waste handling standards for these regulations. Section 237.4(e)(1)(ii) should be interpreted to require the owner
or operator of a waste source to incorporate guidelines in the Operation and Maintenance manual that accounts for
the truck or vessel transfer. The waste transfer station more typically will have the necessary equipment and personnel
to comply with these regulations. Rolling stock and motor vehicles typically are not equipped with containment or
diversionary structures e.g. dip nets, oily water separators etc., and will not, in most cases, be able to comply with
requirements being proposed in &sect;237.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the situation where waste is transferred from an offshore oil and gas development and production facility, the
oil and gas facility is not a waste source for purposes of these regulations. That transfer is governed by the Clean
Water Act (National Pollution Discharge Elimination System), which regulates, among other things, the discharge
of pollutants from point sources, including offshore oil and gas development and production facilities, and the
Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act (MPPRCA) which governs the regulation of garbage generated by
ships. Under the Clean Water Act, EPA has promulgated effluent limitation guidelines and new source performance
standards for the offshore oil and gas industry (58 FR 12453, March 4, 1993). Coverage of these offshore oil and gas
development and production facilities under SPA would be duplicative and unnecessary.

Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 237.3 lays out definitions to be used to interpret and implement these regulations. Some of the definitions
are the same as the definitions in SPA. Others are clarifications or additions to those definitions. Unless otherwise
noted, those terms are consistent with USCG definitions under 33 CFR part 151. The definitions proposed today that
are different or in addition to those in SPA include definitions for the terms waste source, receiving facility, operator,
owner, SPA, waste deposit, and waste transfer station. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes to include within the coverage of this regulation a typical waste transfer from vessel to vessel (with
exceptions noted in the discussion of vessels excluded under the applicability section) by including the term ``vessel''
in the definition of waste source and the definition of receiving facility. This is clearly within the intent of the
statute. Vessels which transfer municipal or commercial waste to other vessels, unless excluded as described above,
will be required to comply with these regulations as a waste source or receiving facility (depending on whether the
transfer is loading onto or offloading from the vessel) and to clean up waste deposited into U.S. coastal waters as
a result of inadequate waste transport or transfer practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``vessel'' includes non self-propelled vessels and the attendant towing vessel. This is included
to ensure that barges tied to a towing vessel are covered by these regulations. They would be considered one vessel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``waste source'' includes any rolling stock or motor vehicles from which waste is directly loaded
onto vessels. As explained 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, once rolling stock (e.g., a garbage truck) enters a waste transfer station, the transfer station, and not the rolling
stock would be the sole waste source responsible for all appropriate waste handling practices and requirements under
these proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that the definition of ``municipal and commercial waste'' is proposed as defined in section 4103 of SPA, as ``solid
waste'' and includes solid, semi-solid, and liquid materials (as defined in section 1004 of the Solid Waste Disposal
Act, 42 U.S.C. 6903), with exceptions as defined in Section 4101(3) of SPA. It also includes waste drilling fluids
and drill cuttings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;237.4 would require the owner or operator of a waste source or receiving facility to: (1) Meet standards
related to loading and offloading municipal or commercial waste to assure that any deposit of waste in coastal waters
is minimized; (2) provide methods and procedures to promptly clean up waste deposited in coastal waters; (3) have
fixed lighting; (4) develop, adopt, and submit, as appropriate, an Operation and Maintenance manual; and (5) maintain
records of waste deposited in coastal waters. EPA considered other alternatives to the regulations proposed today,
such as identifying specific methods and tools for clean up required by the regulations instead of generic waste handling
practice standards. Rather than require the use of specific methods or tools, EPA believes that the generic waste
handling practices contained in the proposed regulations, if promulgated in final form, will be sufficient to eliminate
the waste problems resulting from inadequate municipal and commercial waste handling activities in coastal waters
while preserving necessary flexibility on how to best achieve that result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the proposed waste handling practices for waste sources and receiving facilities are requirements for containment
or diversionary structures. EPA believes this equipment, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, booms, dip nets, and oily water separating equipment, is necessary to control or contain the waste that is deposited
in coastal waters. In addition, EPA proposes that waste sources and receiving facilities must have fixed lighting
when conducting loading and offloading operations between sunset and sunrise. Such lighting is necessary to provide
waste handling personnel with the visual ability to control and contain waste transfers with a minimum of improper
disposal into coastal waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also contains requirements for owner or operators of waste sources and receiving facilities to clean
up all municipal or commercial waste that may have been deposited into coastal waters during loading or offloading.
EPA is proposing that such clean up must occur before the first high tide after the disposal occurs. EPA believes that
requiring this time frame for the clean up is appropriate because otherwise the waste would disperse at high tide beyond
the waste source or receiving facilities' ability to contain or control the waste. Among the cleanup methods set forth
in the proposed rule are sweeper boats, manned boats with nets, booms or other equipment, and/or shoreline cleanup
personnel. The proposed rule would require that cleanup resources be in continuous operation or on standby for loading
and offloading operations which take place during an ebb tide. EPA believes that this requirement will ensure that
waste that is deposited into coastal waters is contained or controlled before it has the chance to disperse with an
ebb tide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also would require waste sources and receiving facilities to have a placard located at the facility which
is readily visible to persons involved in waste handling practices. Such placard would need to display the name and
telephone number of the individual responsible for notifying the USCG National Response Center (NRC) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;424&hyph;8802
in the event of a deposit of waste into coastal waters that is not cleaned up. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPA section 4103(b)(2) provides that the Administrator may require responsible parties to submit Operation and
Maintenance manuals, as appropriate. EPA proposes to require that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 waste sources and receiving facilities covered under SPA (with the exceptions noted in &sect;237.2), develop and
adopt these manuals and that each of the waste sources and receiving facilities submit to the EPA a letter certifying
that the manual was developed in accordance with the guidelines provided. The Operation and Maintenance manual shall
then be submitted to the Administrator only upon request, and, if requested, within two weeks of the request by the
Administrator for the manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives, such as requiring the submission of operation and maintenance manuals by a subset of the regulated
community, or ``as appropriate,'' depending on the circumstances, would be difficult to implement and more likely
an obstacle to meeting the intent of SPA. The development of operation and maintenance manuals by all of the regulated
community will ensure that owners and operators are aware of waste handling procedures, including who shall be responsible
for the cleanup of waste deposits, notification and reporting requirements, and equipment needed to contain and
or clean up a waste deposit. Submission of manuals upon request will help assure that there is a minimum standard of
waste handling practices for the regulated community. To facilitate implementation of this requirement, EPA is
proposing as an appendix to this regulation information on developing an operation and maintenance manual. The proposal
leaves the content of the manual flexible_each responsible party will develop its own procedures and document these
procedures in the manual, following the general guidance in the appendix. EPA encourages those that have already
developed operation and maintenance manuals consistent with the guidelines prescribed in Appendix A to use these
manuals. Those that have not yet developed a relevant operation and maintenance manual are encouraged to use the guidelines
provided in Appendix A to develop a manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, the Administrator or the Secretary may review these manuals and either accept the manual or reject
the manual with comment if the manual fails to provide the necessary information prescribed in the regulations. Operations
may continue during this review process. Failure to develop an operation and maintenance manual, or to follow the
procedures adopted in the facility's manual, would be a violation of these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Operation and Maintenance manual must include procedures for notifying the USCG in the event of a deposit of regulated
waste into coastal waters that is beyond the capacity of the owner or operator to clean up. In addition, it must identify
an individual responsible for such notification. This individual must be designated by the owner or operator of the
waste source or receiving facility. The identification of this person and his or her responsibilities shall provide
a process for reporting and requesting assistance in the case of a deposit beyond the capacity of the waste source,
vessel or receiving facility to contain and clean up after implementing clean up procedures outlined in the operation
and maintenance manual. The responsible individual must be a supervisory employee responsible for waste handling
activities or an officer of the company owning or operating the waste source, vessel or receiving facility, who is
responsible for some aspect of waste handling activities (e.g. vice president in charge of operations). Therefore,
the responsible individual can be an owner or operator of the company. When a municipal or commercial waste deposit
is beyond the capacity of the regulated entity to clean up after implementing the clean up procedures outlined in the
Operation and Maintenance manual, the responsible individual is accountable for notifying the USCG NRC in the case
of a deposit of waste into coastal waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations would require that the Operation and Maintenance manual be accessible to all employees involved
in waste handling activities. In addition to the notification requirements, any person witnessing a deposit of municipal
or commercial waste into coastal waters is encouraged to contact the USCG NRC when it is suspected that there is a violation
of these regulations. Owners and operators are encouraged to put this USCG NRC number on the placard.

Specific Waste Handling Practices for Vessels During Transport 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;237.5 provides a standard for waste handling practices for vessels during transport of municipal
or commercial waste in coastal waters. This standard requires that the owner or operator ensure that the deposit of
waste into coastal waters from a vessel is minimized. For example, open hopper barges transporting municipal solid
waste could comply by covering the entire open area of the hopper barge with a net suitable for minimizing waste deposits
into coastal waters during transport. In addition to meeting this standard, all vessels requiring a SPA permit will
be required to submit an Operation and Maintenance manual to the appropriate USCG office with their permit application.
The permittee or applicant should call the USCG NRC to obtain the address of the appropriate USCG office for the area
in which the vessel will operate. The owners or operators of vessels which have already obtained a conditional permit
under the USCG interim permitting rule (33 CFR Part 151) would be required to submit an Operation and Maintenance manual
within 180 days of the effective date of the rule. Owners and operators of vessels not yet permitted would need to submit
an Operation and Maintenance manual at the time they submit a permit application to the USCG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation and Maintenance manual requirements for vessels are similar to those proposed for waste sources and receiving
facilities discussed above. EPA considered requiring vessel owners and operators to submit to the USCG a letter certifying
the development of the Operation and Maintenance manual rather than the manual itself; however, EPA decided that
because vessels are required to submit an application for a permit it is logical to include a copy of their manual. Submission
of the manual with the permit application ensures that the permit applicant has fully considered these waste handling
practices, cleanup measures, record keeping, and reporting requirements and has documented them accordingly.
Guidance for development of a vessel Operation and Maintenance manual is found in Appendix A of this proposal. Failure
to develop an Operation and Maintenance manual is a violation of SPA and these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing that the owner or operator of a vessel subject to this regulation must secure the waste to ensure that
deposit in coastal waters is minimized. In particular, vessels must not be loaded in excess of their design capacity
or in a manner inconsistent with the vessel's Operation and Maintenance manual. Loading of a vessel in excess of its
capacity would clearly pose risks of waste deposition in coastal waters. In addition, the proposal contains a provision
which would require vessels to have and use a drainage containment system. Such a system will reduce the amount of leachate
discharge into coastal waters. EPA is also proposing that all ports and valves which may be used for flushing or discharging
waste residue from the hull or tanks must be labelled and valve seals shall be placed on the valves. This requirement
would ensure that waste handling personnel would easily be able to control the movement of leachate and waste on the
vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing that owners or operators of vessels remove all municipal or commercial waste deposited into
coastal waters during transport, or, when appropriate, during the waste transfer. This proposal also would require
the vessels to have the capability on board to clean up the waste deposited or to call a support unit to clean up the waste
deposited. In addition, as EPA proposed for waste sources and receiving facilities, the proposal would require vessels
to have a placard located on board which is readily visible to persons involved in waste handling practices. The placard
would have to display the name and telephone number of the individual responsible for notifying the USCG NRC of a deposit
of waste in coastal waters that is beyond their capacity to clean up. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposal would require vessel owners or operators to maintain records of municipal or commercial waste
deposited in coastal waters. The records are to include information on the date and time of day the deposit occurred;
the type of waste deposited; the estimated amount and type of waste recovered; and the name of the vessel from which
the deposit occurred. Section 4103(b)(2) authorizes EPA to include record keeping requirements in the regulations,
and the Agency believes that such requirements are reasonable, and will encourage proper handling of waste so that
deposits into U.S. coastal waters do not occur. Similar requirements have been proposed for the owners and operators
of waste sources and receiving facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with waste handling practices proposed for waste sources and receiving facilities, EPA considered alternatives
to regulating these vessels, such as specific procedures and equipment required on board a vessel. Because of the
variability in nature of municipal and commercial waste transported, in addition to the variety of vessels, waste
sources and receiving facilities affected by this rule, EPA chose to propose a waste handling practice standard alternative
today that is flexible yet sufficient to carry out the goals of the statute.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4103(b)(3) of SPA allows for tracking systems to be required if the Administrator determines that tracking
systems will be necessary to assure adequate enforcement of the requirements in SPA and these regulations. EPA, in
consultation with the USCG, conducted a study on the need for tracking systems for vessels transporting municipal
and commercial waste. The results of this study are documented in a Report to Congress submitted by EPA in August of
1992, titled ``The Need for Tracking Systems on Vessels Transporting Municipal or Commercial Wastes.'' EPA is proposing
to follow the recommendation outlined in that report and require a tracking system in the future only if deemed necessary
by the Administrator (on a case-by-case basis). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing in &sect;237.6 today that a tracking system may be required for owners and operators of waste sources,
vessels, and receiving facilities which have been identified as persistent violators. In determining whether to
require a tracking system, EPA is proposing that the Administrator consider the following variables: (1) The owner's
and operator's history of compliance with SPA; (2) the owner's and operator's history of compliance with other environmental
statutes; (3) the characteristics and amounts of waste transported; and (4) the feasibility of installing a specific
kind of tracking system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 4105 and 4108 of SPA give the Secretary of Transportation the authority to enforce the requirements of SPA
and assess penalties. The Secretary has delegated this authority to the USCG. Under SPA, EPA also is provided authority
under sections 4105 and 4104 to: (1) Conduct investigations of an owner or operator of a vessel or facility if the owner
or operator has five or more separate violations during a six-month period; and (2) request that the Secretary of Transportation
suspend or revoke a permit issued to a vessel for a violation of SPA or regulations promulgated under SPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPA section 4108 states that after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, a person found by the Secretary of Transportation
to have violated the SPA or a regulation promulgated under it for which a civil penalty is provided is liable to the United
States for the civil penalty so provided. 33 U.S.C. section 2608(a). Section 4109 of the SPA establishes that a person
who violates SPA requirements is liable to the United States government for a civil penalty of not more than $25,000.
33 U.S.C. Section 2609(a). The Act specifies that each day of a continuing violation is a separate violation.

Proposed &sect;237.7(a) codifies the notice and opportunity for a hearing provisions from the statutory language
of SPA section 4108(a). The legislative history of SPA makes it clear that the assessment of civil penalties should
not require an ``on the record'' hearing within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. H. Conf. Rep. No.
100&hyph;1090, at 46 (Oct. 18, 1988). As noted above, the USCG has been delegated the authority to enforce the requirements
of SPA, and the legislative history specifically cites the USCG civil penalty procedural rules under 33 CFR 1.07 as
providing the appropriate level of due process, notice, and opportunity to be heard.

 Thus, &sect;237.7(a) of the proposed rule specifies that prior to issuing a SPA civil penalty, notice and an opportunity
for a hearing will be conducted in accordance with the Coast Guard's civil penalty procedures. The Coast Guard has
indicated to EPA its intent to utilize the procedures in 33 CFR 1.07 for imposition of civil penalties under SPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 237.7(b) provides the legal authority for the imposition of a civil penalty for any violation of the substantive
provisions of part 237 by restating the statutory penalty level provided in section 4109(a) of SPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the ``person'' liable for penalties, section 4104(c) broadly defines the term ``person'' to mean an
``individual, trust, firm, joint stock company, corporation (including a government corporation), partnership,
association, state, municipality, commission, political subdivision of a State, or any interstate body.'' 33 U.S.C.
2604(4). Under the terms of &sect;237.3, any of such ``persons'' could qualify as an owner or operator of a regulated
entity, and be subject to the assessment of civil penalties by the Secretary.

, whenever an agency is developing regulations, it must prepare and make available for public comment the impact of
the regulations on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions).
However, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required if the head of the agency certifies that the rule will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Agency has prepared a Regulatory
Impact Analysis (RIA). This RIA shows that the estimated first year cost is approximately $1,609,000 for vessels,
waste sources, and receiving facilities. Annual costs during the next 5 years are estimated at $249,000 for vessels,
waste sources, and receiving facilities. The average first year costs per vessel of $253&hyph;$1,413 are not considered
significant. The average first year costs for waste sources and receiving facilities are estimated at $126&hyph;$2,316.
The largest share of compliance costs, measured as first year costs, will be for waste transport vessels, primarily
supply boats transporting muds and packaged garbage from offshore rigs. Based on EPA's analysis of the effected regulated
community, I certify that this proposed rule imposes no significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small
entities.

(1) The owner or operator of a waste source or receiving facility shall load and offload municipal and commercial waste
to assure that any deposit of waste into coastal waters is minimized. Waste sources and receiving facilities shall
employ containment or diversionary structures and appropriate equipment (such as dip nets and oily water separating
equipment). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The methods adopted by the owner or operator to meet these waste handling practice standards shall be identified

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The owner or operator of a waste source or receiving facility shall remove all municipal or commercial waste that may
have been deposited into coastal waters from waste loading, or unloading operations of a waste source or receiving
facility. Such removal shall be completed prior to the first high tide following the completion of any loading or offloading
operation in which the deposit occurs and before the waste disperses beyond containment ability. The methods for
cleanup of the waste shall be identified in the waste source and receiving facility's Operation and Maintenance manual.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The methods used may include sweeper boats to sweep up solid wastes deposited, manned boats with nets to remove
waste, booms or other equipment to recover waste deposited near shore, and/or shoreline cleanup crews, as long as
they meet the requirements of &sect;237.4(a)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Appendix A_Guidance on Operation and Maintenance Manuals for Waste Sources, Vessels and Receiving Facilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This appendix provides a basic structure for the development of operation and maintenance manuals for the regulated
entities. The operation and maintenance manual developed by a vessel permitted under the Shore Protection Act, or
associated waste source and receiving facility should be a clear statement of: (1) operation and maintenance procedures
for preventing waste from accidentally spilling into coastal waters of the United States, (2) clean up procedures
the regulated entity will follow when a waste deposit does occur, and (3) reporting procedures the regulated entity
will follow when a waste deposit does occur. Each regulated vessel, or associated waste source and receiving facility
should develop an operation and maintenance manual to suit its particular characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The owners or operators of the following vessels (unless excluded, as discussed below) are required to develop
and submit an operation and maintenance manual (&sect;237.2(a)): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A vessel transporting municipal or commercial waste in coastal waters; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Vessels that regularly transport miscellaneous cargo but are hired, contracted, or used to transport municipal
or commercial waste for a specific voyage; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Vessels that transport operational waste from other vessels that meet the definition of municipal or commercial
waste_this does not include vessels transporting their own operational wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The owners or operators of the following vessels, and some others, are excluded from developing and submitting
operation and maintenance manuals (&sect;237.2(b) for full list of exclusions): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Public vessels, defined as vessels that are owned, demise chartered, and operated by the United States Government
or a government of a foreign party, and do not engage in commercial service; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Vessels that transport some quantity of waste incidental to the predominant business or purpose of the vessel.
For example, a ferry which transports a garbage truck loaded with municipal or commercial waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The owners or operators of waste sources and receiving facilities, as defined below and in section 237.3(g) and
(l) are required to develop and submit (upon request) an operation and maintenance manual: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A facility, vessel, or operation that receives municipal or commercial waste unloaded from a vessel; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A vessel or a facility from which municipal or commercial waste is loaded onto a vessel, including any rolling stock
or motor vehicles from which that waste is directly loaded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
II. The Manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The structure and detail of each operation and maintenance manual may vary as the vessel, waste source, or receiving
facility will vary and as the type of waste transferred and transported will vary. As a result of the variation in the
physical nature of municipal and commercial waste, the structure and requirements provided in this appendix are
necessarily generic and will require further elaboration based on the specifics of the operations and maintenance
nuances at your facility, source, or vessel. However, it is expected that an operation and maintenance manual meeting
the minimum requirements of this regulation need not exceed 20 to 30 pages in length.

III. Operation and Maintenance Manuals for Vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The operation and maintenance manual for vessels consists of three parts: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Waste transfer procedures; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Waste clean up procedures; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Waste deposit reporting procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The first part of the operation and maintenance manual shall identify the measures that you will take to minimize
the deposit of waste into coastal waters during transport and transfer activities. In the operation and maintenance
manual you should (&sect;237.5(d)(ii)): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Describe the roles and responsibilities of each relevant member of the crew during waste transfer and transport.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Provide a detailed step-wise description to the vessel crew on the implementation of the technologies and techniques
that will be employed during waste transfer and transport. These should include appropriate containment or diversionary
structures, or other equipment designed to minimize waste deposits. The technologies and techniques described
shall be appropriate to the size and nature of the vessel and must represent a responsible effort to minimize the spillage
of waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Instruct the crew to secure the waste in such a way as to prevent the deposit of waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Direct the crew not to load the vessel in excess of its capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Direct the crew that all ports and valves that may be used for flushing or discharging waste or waste residue from
the hull or tanks must be clearly labelled and that all ports and valves must be sealed except for the purpose of transferring
wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Describe record keeping procedures, i.e. record of amount and type of waste offloaded, or amount and type of waste
received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The second part of the operation and maintenance manual describes for the vessel crew the procedures that will be
used to clean up, promptly and thoroughly, any waste deposited into coastal waters (&sect;237.5(a)(1)(iv)). This
section must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Describe the role and responsibilities of each relevant member of the crew during cleanup. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Describe in detail for the crew the techniques and technologies that will be employed during waste cleanup. The
technologies or techniques must be appropriate to the waste type and the size and nature of the vessel and must represent
a responsible effort to clean up all waste promptly and thoroughly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. In the third part of the operation and maintenance manual describe the procedures to be followed if the vessel's
crew is unable to clean up all of the waste deposited. In this section you must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Provide a contact name and telephone number of the designated responsible person (see section 237.5) involved
in the ownership or operation of the vessel. Indicate that this contact person should be notified immediately by telephone,
marine radio if the crew is unable to completely clean up the waste deposited. This contact name and phone number and
the number of the USCG NRC must be posted on the vessel in a location visible to the vessel's crew. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Provide the telephone number of the USCG NRC to be called by the responsible person if the crew is unable to completely
clean up the waste deposited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Provide an example of a followup letter to be used by the responsible person to report the waste deposit to the USCG
NRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Provide copies of the form that assists record-keeping and reporting in the event of a waste deposit. The operation
and maintenance manual must instruct the appropriate crew member to complete one of these forms for each deposit of
waste. The record must include the time and date of the deposit, estimates of the amount of wastes deposited and amount
retrieved, actions taken to clean up the waste deposit, and any other pertinent information. If an action was not accomplished
or successful, it is important to document why those actions were taken. Any actions to prevent further incidents
of this type should also be recorded. All waste deposits must be recorded, whether cleaned up or not.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This action proposes to amend Food Stamp Program regulations to implement several provisions of the Mickey Leland
Childhood Hunger Relief Act. The provisions in this proposal would: simplify the household definition; establish
eligibility for children who live with their food stamp eligible parents in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation center;
exclude from resources the value of vehicles used to transport fuel or water; increase the fair market value exclusion
of vehicles for determining a household's resource limit; exclude certain general assistance vendor payments;
exclude the earnings of students under age 22 who live with their parents; increase the maximum amount of the dependent
care deduction; eliminate the current Federally imposed limit and require State agencies to establish a statewide
limit on the dependent care reimbursement paid to participants in the Food Stamp Employment and Training Program;
and require proration of benefits only after a break of more than one month in certification.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under No. 10.551. For the reasons
set forth in the proposed rule and related notices of 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V (48 FR 29115), this Program is excluded
from the scope of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This proposed rule is not intended to have retroactive effect
unless so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of this rule or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In
the Food Stamp Program, the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) For Program benefit recipients_State
administrative procedures issued to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_administrative
procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities)
or part 275 (for rules related to QC liabilities); (3) for Program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures

The Department has also reviewed this proposed rule in relation to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980). Ellen Haas, Assistant Secretary for Food and
Consumer Services, has certified that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. The proposed requirements will affect food stamp applicants and recipients and the State and local
agencies that administer the Program. Eligibility criteria will be simplified and some currently participating
households will realize an increase in Program benefits.

Need for Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This action is required as a result of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act which amends the Food Stamp Act
of 1977, as amended, to include provisions that would: (1) Simplify the household definition; (2) establish eligibility
for children who live with their food stamp eligible parents in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation center; (3) exclude
from resources the value of vehicles used to transport fuel or water; (4) increase the fair market value exclusion
of vehicles for determining a household's resource limit; (5) exclude certain general assistance vendor payments;
(6) exclude the earnings of students under age 22 who live with their parents; (7) increase the maximum amount of the
dependent care deduction; (8) eliminate the current Federally imposed limit and require State agencies to establish
a statewide limit on the dependent care reimbursement paid to participants in the Food Stamp Employment and Training
Program; and (9) require proration of benefits only in the initial month of certification.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
It is estimated that this action would increase the cost of the Food Stamp Program by approximately $7 million in Fiscal
Year 1994; $110 million in Fiscal Year 1995; $132 million in Fiscal Year 1996; $187 million in Fiscal Year 1997; and
$207 million in Fiscal Year 1998.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 4, 1994, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing a public hearing on January 20, 1994. The public hearing was scheduled to provide an opportunity for State
agencies, advocacy groups, and other interested parties to engage in public dialogue on issues concerning the regulatory
provisions that are to be published in connection with the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (Act) amendments made by the Mickey
Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act, Chapter 3, Title XIII, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66,
enacted August 10, 1993 (Leland Act). All provisions of the Leland Act pertinent to the Food Stamp Program (Program)
were included as topics of dialogue during the public hearing, including the provisions contained in this proposed
rulemaking.

Simplifying the Household Definition for Households with Children and Others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the Food Stamp Act of 1977 was enacted, the concept of a ``household'' was defined as: (1) An individual living
alone; (2) an individual living with others but customarily purchasing food and preparing meals for home consumption
separate and apart from the others; (3) an individual who is a boarder living with others and paying reasonable compensation
to the others for meals for home consumption; (4) a group of individuals living together for whom food is customarily
purchased in common and for whom meals are prepared together for home consumption; or (5) a group of individuals who
are boarders, living with others and paying reasonable compensation to the others for meals for home consumption.
Separate household status was not granted to a spouse of a household member, or to children under 18 years of age under
the parental control of a member of the household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 101 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;35) amended section 3(i) of the Act to
provide that parents and children living together could be considered as separate households if they purchase and
prepare meals separately, but only if at least one parent is 60 years of age or older or is disabled. The final rule to
implement this revision was published on March 28, 1986 (51 FR 10764). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 142 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;253) amended section 3(i) of the Act
to provide that siblings living together had to be included in the same household unless at least one of the siblings
is elderly or disabled and they purchased and prepared their meals separately. The Department construed the term
``siblings'' to include natural, adopted, half or step-siblings. The final rule to implement this revision was published
on March 28, 1986 (51 FR 10764). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July 1987, section 802 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;77) (McKinney Act)
amended section 3(i) of the Food Stamp Act to provide an exception to the parent-child rule which allows three generations
living together to form two separate households if the parent with minor children and the minor children are purchasing
and preparing meals separately from the minor children's grandparent(s). The McKinney Act also provided an exception
to the sibling rule which allowed two siblings living together to form two separate households if one sibling is a parent
of minor children in residence and the parent and minor children purchase and prepare meals separately from the parent's
sibling. The Department considered children under 18 years of age who are under the parental control of an adult household
member to be minors. In addition, section 802 of the McKinney Act specifically provided that such households be subject
to reexamination at least once every six months. Accordingly, the Department published a final rule at 58 FR 58444
to implement these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13931 of the Leland Act amended section 3(i) of the Food Stamp Act to require that persons who live together
and purchase food and prepare meals separately may apply as separate households, except for (1) spouses who live together,
(2) parents and their children 21 years of age or younger (who are not themselves parents living with their children
or married and living with their spouses), and (3) children (excluding foster children) under 18 years of age who live
with and are under the parental control of a person other than their parent. These groups shall be treated as a group
of individuals who customarily purchase and prepare meals together for home consumption even if they do not do so.
The parent/child and siblings provisions of 7 CFR 273.1(a) are no longer valid. The provision of section 3(i) of the
Act which grants separate household status to individuals who are 60 years of age or older and unable to purchase food
and prepare meals, was not changed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress amended the household definition for several reasons. According to the legislative history cited below,
the current household definition was too ``convoluted,'' thereby making it ``needlessly complex and error-prone.''
In addition, the current household definition did not recognize that more and more families and individuals must
share housing because of high housing costs or unemployment. The legislative history further states that the change
in household definition would remove the burden imposed on relatives who ``double up'' but still purchase food and
prepare meals separately. (House Report No. 111, 103rd Congress, lst session (199), p.34). Congress also prohibited
minor children who are under the parental control of an adult household member from establishing a separate household.
This prohibition prevents minor children from being treated as separate households when they are in the care of adults,
whether or not legal adoption has taken place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is planning to retain the current language regarding the rule that, with a few exceptions, persons
who live together and purchase food and prepare meals together are one household. The Department is proposing to revise
the exceptions which require some related individuals to be included in the same household even if they purchase food
and prepare meals separately. Under the proposal, spouses who live together must be considered one household. Natural,
adopted, and stepchildren and other children under 18 years of age who are under the parental control of a member of
the household, other than a parent, must be included in the same household as the parent or other person with parental
control even if they purchase food and prepare meals separately unless the child is living with his or her own children
or is married and living with his or her spouse. In addition, children ages 18, 19, 20, and 21 who are natural, adopted,
or stepchildren must be included in the same household as the parent even if they purchase food and prepare meals separately,
unless the child is living with his or her children or is married and living with his or her spouse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to Food Stamp Program Policy Memo 3&hyph;93&hyph;6 dated March 26, 1993, children under parental control
for food stamp eligibility purposes are ``minors who are dependents_financial or otherwise_of the household as
opposed to independent units.'' This definition was intended to transcend State laws which vary widely on parental
control. The Department is proposing to amend this definition to specify that children who are married and living
with their spouse are not under parental control and, further, that children who are living with children of their
own are not under parental control. This will provide the same treatment for children under 18 living with an adult
other than a parent that is provided for natural, adopted and stepchildren; i.e., they may be a separate household
if they are living with their children or married and living with their spouse and they purchase and prepare their meals
separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2) (i)(B) through (D) accordingly. The Department is also proposing
two conforming amendments. The first proposed conforming amendment would amend 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2)(ii) to include
a reference to 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2)(i)(C). The second proposed amendment would amend 7 CFR 273.10(f)(2), which mandates
certification periods of up to six months for households meeting the parent/child or siblings provision of 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2)(i)(C)
and (D). The Department proposes to remove this section because this requirement was removed from the Food Stamp Act
when the household definition was changed. The Department is proposing no change to paragraph 7 CFR 273.1(a)(2)(i)(A)
regarding the grouping of spouses since the rule is unaffected by the Leland Act.

Eligibility of Children of Parents Participating in Drug or Alcohol Treatment Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 3(i) of the Food Stamp Act, food stamp benefits are authorized for narcotic addicts or alcoholics who
live under the supervision of a private non-profit institution for the purpose of regular participation in a drug
or alcoholic treatment program. Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.1(f)(2) (i) and (ii) permit residents of alcohol
or drug treatment centers to apply as a one-person household and be certified for food stamps through the use of an authorized
representative who is an employee of and designated by the publicly operated community mental health center or the
private non-profit organization or institution that is administering the treatment and rehabilitation program.
According to the Act at section 3(i) and 7 CFR 273.1(e), spouses and children living with residents of alcohol or drug
treatment centers are not eligible if the center provides the majority of their meals. If the center does not provide
the majority of their meals, the spouses and children may qualify for food stamps as a separate household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the implementation of this regulation, there have been changes in some drug and alcohol treatment centers'
policy regarding addicts and their children. Previously, addicts with children were required to leave them with
family or friends, or place them in foster care since children were not permitted to remain with their parents during
treatment. Now, several residential treatment programs permit addicts with children to live as a family unit while
the parents participate in treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While some residential treatment programs accept addicts and their children, the Food Stamp Act did not authorize
benefits for these children even though their parents were eligible for food stamps when the center provided the majority
of their meals. In the past, the Department received several waiver requests from State agencies to add children who
live with their parent(s) while the parent(s) is (are) a resident(s) of an alcohol or drug treatment center to the parent's
food stamp household. But the provisions of the Food Stamp Act did not permit the Department to waive the regulations
for these children.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13932 of the Leland Act amended the Food Stamp Act to provide Food Stamp Program eligibility to children living
with their eligible parent(s) in a drug or alcohol treatment center regardless of whether or not the center provides
the majority of the children's meals. The children would be considered part of the parent's household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the household definition stated in section 13931 of the Leland Act, parents and their natural, adopted or stepchildren
21 years of age or younger are considered one household except when the child under 21 is living with his/her children
or is married and living with his/her spouse. Then the child's household can be considered a separate household from
that of the parent(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of parents and children living in a drug or alcohol treatment center, the circumstances are different.
In the course of discussion during the January 20, 1994 public hearing, one State agency representative asked that
children and parents living in residential drug or alcohol treatment programs be considered separate households.
The State agency representative explained that the State agency provided different funding amount for meals served
to adults and children living in residential drug or alcohol treatment centers. Permitting separate household status
for the parents and children residing in these treatment centers would provide the State agency with an easy method
for calculating and issuing food stamp benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered these comments and believes that there are significant problems with this suggested
policy of granting separate household status to parents and children living in residential drug or alcohol treatment
centers even though such a policy may be less complicated for a particular State agency. The revised household definition
of section 13931 of the Leland Act requires parents and children under 21 years of age to be considered one household
with two exceptions. Therefore, to provide separate household status to parents and children under 21 who live together
in a residential drug or alcohol treatment center would violate section 13931 of the Leland Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, under current regulations at 7 CFR 273.1(f)(2), residents of drug or alcohol treatment centers are permitted
to apply for food stamps through an authorized representative. If parents and children living in a drug or alcohol
treatment program were treated as separate households, problems resulting from the need for authorized representatives
for both the parent and child could become very confusing. Under 7 CFR 273.1(f)(2), the authorized representative
for residents of a drug or alcohol treatment center must be an employee of the institution administering the treatment
program. The Department believes that it was the intent of Congress to include parents and children in the same household
even when the parent is in a drug or alcohol treatment center. By including the parent and child in the same household,
the parent's income would be counted only once and no authorized representative would be needed for the child. Currently,
residents of a drug or alcohol treatment center are certified through an authorized representative of the center.
The Department believes that the authorized representative of the center should represent the entire household
while the household lives in the center and the center provides the majority of its meals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.1(e)(1)(ii) to extend food stamp eligibility to children
of narcotic addicts or alcoholics who are residents of drug or alcohol treatment centers. Conforming language is
also being proposed to include children of narcotic addicts or alcoholics in the ``Eligible foods'' definition of
7 CFR 271.2 so that these children will become eligible for meals served to eligible households by drug or alcohol rehabilitation
centers. A conforming amendment is also being proposed to 7 CFR 273.1(f)(2).

Vehicles Necessary to Carry Fuel or Water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, a vehicle is totally exempt from being counted as a resource if it is used primarily (over 50 percent of the
time) for income producing purposes; annually produces income consistent with its fair market value; necessary
for long-distance travel, other than daily commuting, that is essential to the employment of a household member;
used as the household's home; or is necessary to transport a physically disabled household member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13923 of the Leland Act amended section 5(g)(2) of the Act to exclude from resources the value of a vehicle that
a household depends upon to carry fuel for heating or water for home use when such transported fuel or water is the primary
source of fuel or water for the household. It is the intent of Congress that households without heating fuel or piped
water into their homes receive this resource exclusion without having to meet any additional tests concerning the
nature, capabilities, or other uses of the vehicle. House Report No. 111, 103rd Congress, 1st Session, p. 33. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule mirrors the language of section 13924 of the Leland Act and the accompanying legislative history.
The Department believes the proposed regulation is general enough to permit State agencies the greatest flexibility.
During the January 20, 1994 public hearing, some individuals illustrated the need for flexibility by stating that
in remote areas of Alaska, households bring in their fuel and water by boat. Under this proposed rule, the State agency
would have the flexibility to determine if the boat meets the vehicle exclusion requirement of section 13923 of the
Leland Act because the Department does not define the term ``vehicle''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is not proposing any specific verification requirements for determining if the value of a vehicle
should be excluded under section 13924. However, the Department expects that State agencies will verify the need
for a vehicle to carry fuel and water for the household's use and is soliciting comments on the best means of verification.
Some State agencies may decide to add a question to their food stamp applications that asks if a household depends on
a vehicle to carry water or fuel for heating. Other State agencies may instruct its eligibility workers to ask such
a question at a household's certification interview.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department understands that there will be some instances where households are hooked up to public utilities,
such as heat and water, but are unable to use these utilities for whatever reason, such as non-payment of utility bill.
The Department believes that as long as a household is using a vehicle to carry fuel for heat or water, access to public
utilities should have no bearing on the vehicle exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.8(h)(1) to add a new paragraph (vi) to exclude as a resource
the value of a vehicle that a household depends upon to carry fuel for heating or water for home use when such transported
fuel or water is the primary source of fuel or water for the household. Households will receive this resource exclusion
without having to meet any additional tests concerning the nature, capabilities, or other uses of the vehicle. Furthermore,
the household will not be required to provide documentary evidence, as required in 7 CFR 273.2(f)(4), unless the basis
for the exclusion of the vehicle is questionable. If the basis for the exclusion of a vehicle is questionable, the State
agency must require documentation showing that the vehicle is used to carry fuel for heating or water for home use.
Also, the Department is proposing a technical amendment to 7 CFR 273.8(h)(6) to correct an oversight in the summary
of how vehicles are handled. The Department failed to list vehicles necessary to transport a physically disabled
household member as an exclusion. The Department proposes to add this exclusion in addition to the exclusion for a
vehicle used to carry fuel or water.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.8(h)(3), in accordance with section 5(g) of the Act, require that all licensed vehicles
be evaluated to determine their fair market value over $4,500. The fair market value over $4,500 is counted as a resource
for one vehicle per household and for vehicles used for work, training or education, or to seek work. For other vehicles,
the fair market value over $4,500 or the equity value, whichever is greater, is counted as a resource. 7 CFR 273.8(h)
excludes a vehicle as a resource if the vehicle is used primarily for income producing purposes; annually produces
income consistent with its fair market value; is necessary for long-distance travel that is essential to employment;
is used as a household's home; or is necessary to transport a physically disabled household member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has received numerous comments from State agencies, the general public and advocate groups about
the $4,500 fair market value resource exclusion, which has remained unchanged since the enactment of the Food Stamp
Act of 1977. The comments expressed the belief that the $4,500 fair market value resource exclusion is too low and does
not accurately reflect changes due to inflation, and thus was detrimental to food stamp households. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13923 of the Leland Act amended section 5(g)(2) of the Act to increase the fair market value resource exclusion
of vehicles in the following manner. The current $4,500 fair market value resource exclusion will remain in effect
through August 31, 1994. On September 1, 1994, the resource exclusion will increase to $4,550 and be effective through
September 30, 1995. On October 1, 1995, the resource exclusion will increase again to $4,600 and be effective through
September 30, 1996. On October 1, 1996 and on every October 1 thereafter, the fair market value resource exclusion
of vehicles shall be adjusted annually, using a base of $5,000, to reflect changes in the new car component of the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending
the preceding June 30th, rounded to the nearest $50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to implement Section 13923 of the Leland Act, the Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.8(h)(3) in accordance
with the timetable prescribed by Section 13923. The Department would provide the yearly fair market value resource
exclusion for the period beginning October 1, 1996 and thereafter to State agencies on an annual basis.

General Assistance (GA) Vendor Payments_7 CFR 273.9(c)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(b)(2)(i) require State agencies to count payments from GA programs (as defined
in 7 CFR 271.2) as unearned income even if provided in the form of a third-party payment, unless the vendor payment is
specifically exempt under 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13915 of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act (the 1993 Leland Act), Chapter 3, Title XIII of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 674, enacted August 10, 1993), amended section
5(k)(1)(B) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (the Act), 7 U.S.C. 2014(k)(1)(B), to change the treatment of GA
vendor payments. As amended, section 5(k)(1)(B) provides that GA provided to a third party on behalf of a household
by a State or local government shall be considered money payable directly to the household if the assistance is provided
in lieu of a benefit payable to the household for housing expenses (exclusive of energy or utility-cost assistance)
under a State or local general assistance program or another basic assistance program comparable to GA (as determined
by the Secretary). Previously, assistance provided for living expenses was included as income, with specified exceptions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
House Report 103&hyph;111, p. 30 (May 25, 1993) indicates that administration of the current provision requiring
that GA assistance provided for living expenses be counted as income is complex. It also states that a recipient's
need for food stamp assistance is not materially affected by many of the vendor payments, such as a voucher for gasoline
to get to a job interview or a one-time payment to a utility company to prevent a shutoff of service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the House Report indicates that Congress wanted to reduce the number of GA vendor payments counted as
income in States that provide some GA in cash. Under section 1722 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade
Act of 1990, (Pub. L. 101&hyph;624), GA vendor payments are excluded from income pursuant to section 5(k)(1)(H) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. 2014(k)(1)(H), in States in which, by State law, no cash assistance is provided. Section 13915 of
the 1993 Leland Act would reduce the differences in treatment of GA payments from one State to another. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 Leland Act did not remove the provision of section 5(k)(2) that the requirement to count public assistance
(PA) or GA payments shall not apply to certain energy assistance, assistance provided by a State or local housing authority,
emergency assistance for migrant or seasonal farmworker households during the period such households are in the
job stream, housing assistance payments made to a third party on behalf of a household residing in transitional housing
for the homeless, or special or emergency assistance.

Therefore, we are proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1)(ii) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that housing assistance provided to a third party on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behalf of a household by a State or local GA program or another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basic assistance program comparable to GA (as defined in &sect;271.2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be counted as income, unless the assistance is one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Assistance provided for utility costs. The exclusion is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not limited to the costs identified in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5) as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable costs for the purposes of the excess shelter deduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Energy assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Assistance provided by a State or local housing

d. Emergency assistance for migrant or seasonal farmworker

households in the job stream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Transitional housing assistance for the homeless. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Emergency or special assistance over and above the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Assistance provided under a GA program if no payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are made under the program in cash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1)(ii) address both PA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GA vendor payments. The Food Stamp Program regulations at 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
271.2 define GA as assistance financed by State or local funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``as part of a program which provides assistance to cover living 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses or other basic needs intended to promote the health or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well-being of recipients.'' PA is defined in that section to mean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain specified programs authorized under the Social Security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1935, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AFDC) and aid to the aged, blind and disabled. The 1993 Leland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act did not make any changes in the provisions of section 5(k) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act concerning treatment of PA vendor payments. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PA and GA vendor payments must be treated differently, and we are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing in this rule to separate the provisions for treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of PA and GA vendor payments. Because of the need to reorganize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1) to distinguish between treatment of GA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and PA payments, we are proposing to take advantage of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to restructure 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1) in its entirety. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are proposing this reorganization to make specific vendor payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusions easier to locate in the regulations. We are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing any changes in the requirements of the section except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those required by the 1993 Leland Act related to the GA vendor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments. We are proposing minor changes in the language of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section for clarity. We are also proposing to remove the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference in current 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1)(iii) to the experimental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing allowance programs in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and South 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bend, Indiana, because the programs are no longer in existence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed reorganization of &sect;273.9(c)(1), the provisions

for excluding vendor payments would be divided into seven

Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(c)(7) require State agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to exclude from household income the earned income of children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who are members of the household, students at least half-time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and under 18. The exclusion applies during temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interruptions in school attendance, provided the child's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrollment will resume following the break. If the child's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earnings or amount of work performed cannot be differentiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from that of other household members, the total earnings are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prorated equally among the working members and the child's pro 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rata share is excluded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current regulations, individuals are considered children if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are under the parental control of another household member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exclusion does not apply if the student has formed a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household. No distinction is made between students who live with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their parents in a separate food stamp household and students who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
live separately from parents. In addition, the regulations do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not specify what type of educational institution the student must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be attending (high school, college, vocational training, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13911 of the 1993 Leland Act amended section 5(d)(7) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act, 7 U.S.C. 2014(d)(7), to exclude ``income earned by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
child who is a member of the household, who is an elementary or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary school student, and who is 21 years of age or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
younger *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The legislative history (House Report 103&hyph;111, pp. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27&hyph;28) indicates that the provision is intended to assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families with high school students whose education has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delayed (for example, students who have to learn English in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classroom) and who have not been able to complete high school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before age 18. Under current rules, the income of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students would be counted in determining the eligibility and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits of the household and could result in a reduction in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family's benefits or ineligibility. The Report also indicates at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
p. 28 that ``[t]he Committee wishes to emphasize that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment in no way changes current law regarding those students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who live away from home and have formed a separate household.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several issues have arisen in connection with the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision that will continue to be relevant under the changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed to implement section 13911 of the 1993 Leland Act. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue has been whether a student has to be under the parental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of a household member, as currently required, for his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her income to be excluded. Parental control was the issue in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989 lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
District of Maine (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dion v. Commissioner, Maine Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Social Services v. Sullivan and Yeutter.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The case involved a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high school student under 18 with a child. The student and child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lived with the student's parents but were certified as a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food stamp household. The State agency did not exclude the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's earnings from part-time work because the student was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not under parental control. The District Court decided that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parental control provision of the current regulations was invalid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the Act does not expressly contain such a limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This decision was subsequently upheld by the First Circuit Court 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Appeals, 933 F.2d 13 (1st Cir. 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory language of section 13911 does not specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrict the student income exclusion to students living with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their parents or under the parental control of another adult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under a literal reading of the amended statute, the exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would apply to any high school or elementary school student under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22, even if the student was living separately from his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parents. The House Report at p. 28 indicates, however, that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion was not intended to apply to students who have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established a separate residence. Both the House Report and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dion 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decision support allowing the exclusion to students who live 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with their parents but who may have a separate food stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household. This is a middle position between the extremes of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unrestricted exclusion and one limited to students under parental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control, and it is the position we are proposing to adopt. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invite comments concerning the best way to implement this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision so as to limit the income exclusion to the households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress intended to help without placing an unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative burden on households and State agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this rule we are proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.9(c)(7) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that the earned income of elementary or high school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who are 21 years of age or younger and living with their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parents (rather than in a separate living arrangement) shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded. The exclusion would apply if the student is in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same food stamp household as a natural, adoptive or step-parent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or is under the parental control of another member of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food stamp household. The exclusion would also be allowed if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student is in a separate food stamp household but is living with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a natural, adoptive or step-parent. Parental control would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a factor if the student is in a separate food stamp household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue concerning the income of students that has come to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
our attention is whether to require that students be attending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school at least half-time for the exclusion to apply. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislative history of section 13911 of the 1993 Leland Act did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not address this issue. However, because the legislation extends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exclusion to students age 21 and under, we believe it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important that the exclusion be limited only to those students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who are seriously pursuing a regular high school diploma or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Equivalency Diploma (GED). According to House Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
103&hyph;111, Congress intended this income exclusion to assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households in which a student's education has been delayed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Frequently, students who have dropped out of school for a time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decide to obtain a GED instead of a regular high school diploma. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These students may be earning sufficient income to adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the household's benefits if the earnings were counted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we are proposing that the earned income of elementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or high school students be excluded if the student is attending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school (including GED classes) at least half-time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A related issue is the point at which a student's earnings must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be counted. For example, a household applies on June 10, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student will be 21 on June 20. Or, a household is certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through December 31, and the student turns 21 on August 10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This issue was addressed in Policy Memo 84&hyph;6 dated October 24, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1983, which has since been rescinded. The Policy Memo provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that if a student turned 18 in the month of application, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caseworker should determine at the time of the interview how much 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income the student received or anticipated receiving after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turning 18. That amount would be counted as income to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household, and any amount received prior to the 18th birthday 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be excluded. For participating households, the Policy Memo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided that the student's earned income should not be counted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before he or she turned 18. Because it would not be feasible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine and count only the portion of a month's income that was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received after the birthday for an ongoing household, the income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be counted in the month the student turned 18 only if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change occurred on the first of the month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 4, 1991 (56 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 63597), amended the regulations for retrospective budgeting to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporate the provisions of Policy Memo 84&hyph;6 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrospectively budgeted households into the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.21(j)(1)(vii)(A) provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the earned income of a student is counted only if the student is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18 years of age or older ``at the beginning of the budget month.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By way of providing an example, the preamble to the rule (56 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 63602) clarifies that in a two-month retrospective budgeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, if a student turns 18 during the month of September, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student's earned income is not counted until the month of October 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
becomes the budget month. That is when the student is 18 years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of age at the beginning of the budget month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An objection was raised to the provision in Policy Memo 84&hyph;6 that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required State agencies to treat applicant and ongoing households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differently. For the month of application, workers were required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to count the income received by a student after he turned 18. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in an ongoing household, the income was not to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counted unless the student turned 18 on the first of the month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To make the requirements for applicant and ongoing households and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective and retrospective budgeting procedures the same, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are proposing to add a new paragraph (E) to 7 CFR 273.10(e)(2)(i) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to provide that for prospective eligibility and benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination, the earned income of a high school or elementary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school student shall be counted beginning with the month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following the month in which the student turns 22. We are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.21(j)(1)(vii) to provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrospective eligibility and budgeting purposes that the income 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an elementary or secondary student shall be counted beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the budget month after the month in which the student turns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. In the examples above, the earnings of the student who will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be 22 in the middle of June, the month of application, would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be included in household income until July. The earnings of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student who turns 22 in August in the middle of the certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period would not be included in household income until September. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eligibility workers would have to be alert to a change in the age 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a student during the certification period. Under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, a student's earnings would be included in budget month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income the month following the month the student turns 22 under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both prospective and retrospective budgeting and at application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and during the certification period. Under retrospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
budgeting, the effect of including a student's earnings would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be reflected in the allotment until the issuance month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corresponding to the budget month following the month in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student becomes 22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule proposes to amend 7 CFR 273.9(c)(7) to provide that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earned income of an elementary or secondary school student shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be excluded if the student is (1) 21 years of age or younger; (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
living in the same food stamp household with a natural, adoptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or step-parent, under the parental control of another member of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same food stamp household other than a parent, or in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate food stamp household but living with a natural, adoptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or step-parent; and (3) attending school (including GED classes) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least half-time. We are retaining the provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current regulations regarding the continuation of the exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during temporary interruptions in school attendance and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proration of income when the child's share cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differentiated. We are also proposing to amend 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.10(e)(2)(i) and 7 CFR 273.21(j)(1)(vii)(A) to provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the earnings of elementary and secondary school students shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be counted until the month following the month in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student becomes 22. For clarity, we propose to amend the phrase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the first sentence of 7 CFR 273.21(j)(1)(vii)(A) regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
averaged income to add a reference to 7 CFR 273.21(f), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifies the circumstances under which retrospectively budgeted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income may be averaged.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 7 CFR 273.9(d)(4), households are allowed to deduct from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their income their actual dependent care expenses up to a maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of $160 per month per dependent. These dependent care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses must be necessary for a household member: (1) to accept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or continue employment, (2) to participate in the Food Stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program's Employment and Training (E&amp;T) Program or an equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort by those not subject to E&amp;T, or (3) to attend training or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive education or training which is preparatory to employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 404 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;435 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HPA), amended section 5(e) of the Act to increase the dependent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care deduction for certain households and to provide that other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households would not be entitled to the dependent care deduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HPA provided that households eligible for the dependent care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction can deduct up to $160 a month per dependent rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$160 per household, and specified that the dependent care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction cannot be taken for dependent care expenses which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursed under an employment and training program as specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 6(d)(4)(I) of the Act. Accordingly, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended 7 CFR 273.9(d)(4) and 7 CFR 273.10(e)(1)(i)(E) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement HPA changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 13, 1988, the Family Support Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;485, (Family Support Act) was enacted. Section
302 of Title III 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Family Support Act provides for Transitional Child Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(TCC) for eligible families which have ceased to receive Aid to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Program benefits as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of increased hours or increased income from employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 301 of Title III also specifies that any money received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as payment for child care or any reimbursement for costs incurred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for child care shall not be treated as income for purposes of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other Federal or federally assisted program that bases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility or the amount of benefits upon need. In response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title III, the Department amended 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a deduction for only the portion of child care expense which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not reimbursed or not paid for by the Job Opportunities and Basic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Skills Training (JOBS) program under Title IV&hyph;F of the Social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 681, et seq.) or the Transitional Child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorizing TCC are found in section 402(g)(1) of the Social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 602(g)(1).) With the enactment of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Leland Act, additional modifications to Food Stamp Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations are required in the areas of the dependent care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction and the amount allowed for E&amp;T dependent care and other

Dependent Care Deduction

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13922 of the Leland Act amended section 5(e) of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by replacing the $160 a month maximum dependent care deduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a two-tier maximum dependent care deduction. For each child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the age of two, the maximum monthly dependent care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction is $200; for all other dependents, the maximum monthly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent care deduction is $175. Implementation of the two-tier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum dependent care deduction shall take effect and shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented on September 1, 1994. In its discussion on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing the two-tier maximum dependent care deduction, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress urged that implementation be conducted in ways that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize administrative burdens on State agencies. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when a child reaches his or her second birthday before the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a certification period, the State agency should not be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to reduce the maximum monthly dependent care deduction from $200 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to $175 until the household's next recertification (House 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conference Report No. 213, 103rd Congress, 1st Session (1993), p. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
926). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.9(d)(4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 7 CFR 273.10(e) by replacing the $160 a month maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent care deduction with the $200 a month maximum dependent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care deduction for each child under two years of age and $175 a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month maximum dependent care deduction for each other dependent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also adding a requirement that whenever a child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaches his or her birthday during the certification period, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum dependent care deduction shall be adjusted no later than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next regularly scheduled recertification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Department is proposing a conforming change to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to replace the term ``child care expense''

with the term ``dependent care expense'' in order to clarify that

it is dependent care expenses reimbursed by the JOBS or TCC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs which are not deductible for food stamp households, not

just child care expenses.

Since 1971, individuals who are not specifically exempted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act have been required to register for work at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application as a condition of eligibility for food stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits. Currently, 7 CFR 273.7(a) requires that they register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at application and once every 12 months thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In April 1987, State agencies began operating the Food Stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employment and Training (E&amp;T) Program, a program aimed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically at improving food stamp recipients' ability to gain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment, increase earnings and reduce their dependency on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public assistance. State agencies operate a variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment and training activities, including job search and job 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
search training, self-employment efforts, and vocational and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Work registrants are the most job ready of the food stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population and comprise approximately 8 percent of all food stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipients. Of those food stamp recipients who register for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work, about 70 percent are subject to the E&amp;T requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Certain work registrants are exempted from E&amp;T participation by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies and are not required to participate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. Food stamp recipients may also volunteer to participate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the E&amp;T program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.7(d)(1)(ii) require State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to provide payments or reimbursements to participants in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Food Stamp E&amp;T program for certain expenses that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably necessary and directly related to participation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E&amp;T program. The Federal government matches half the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies spend to reimburse participants under 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.7(d)(1)(ii)(B) for the actual costs of transportation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other costs (excluding dependent care) that are determined by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency to be necessary and directly related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the E&amp;T program. Therefore, the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government will pay up to $12.50 of the $25 per month. State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies may supplement this amount, but without Federal matching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies must also provide payments or reimbursements to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E&amp;T participants for dependent care expenditures of up to $160 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per dependent per month. The Federal government will pay up to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$80 of the $160 per month. A reimbursement cannot be provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a dependent age 13 or older unless the dependent is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physically and/or mentally incapable of caring for himself or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
herself or is under court supervision. The Federal government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not reimburse more than the actual cost of dependent care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses up to $80 per dependent per month, regardless of how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many household members are participating in E&amp;T. Finally, an E&amp;T 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participant is not entitled to the reimbursement for dependent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care expenditures if a member of the participant's food stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household provides the dependent care services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Changes to Dependent Care Reimbursements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13922 of the Leland Act amended section 6(d) of the Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stamp Act to remove the $160 cap on dependent care reimbursements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to participants in the E&amp;T program. In place of the cap, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies must reimburse the actual costs of dependent care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses up to a limit set by the State agency. Section 13922 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stipulates that the statewide limit set by the State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be less than the limit for the dependent care deduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 5(e) of the Act, that is, $200 per month for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent under age 2 and $175 per month for each other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent. In no event may the reimbursement exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable local market rate as determined by procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the JOBS Program. Thus, the State agency must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimburse actual costs for dependent care up to either the local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market rate or the statewide limit set by the State agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever is lower. The Department will continue to match State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency expenditures for reimbursements at the 50 percent level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An example will help to explain the above provision. Assume that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State agency sets a statewide limit of $250, which is higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the dependent care deduction, on the amount of dependent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care costs it will reimburse. In City A, the local market rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is also $250. Thus, the State agency would reimburse a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participant in the E&amp;T program for actual costs up to $250. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
City B, the local market rate is $225. Even if the actual cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for dependent care is $250, the State agency will only reimburse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the participant for $225, the local market rate, as the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency cannot provide reimbursement payments which exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local market rate. In City C, the local market rate is $275. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State agency would reimburse the participant for $250, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statewide limit. In any of the scenarios above, if the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of dependent care was less than the statewide limit of $250, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State agency would only reimburse the actual cost of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hence, the State agency must pay the lowest of the actual cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependent care, the local market rate, or the statewide limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State agency may supplement this amount, but without Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matching funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons determined by the State agency to have actual monthly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses that are reasonably necessary and directly related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the E&amp;T program which exceed the allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement amount (i.e., exceed the local market rate) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be considered by the State agency to have good cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for nonparticipation in an E&amp;T component.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Defining the Statewide Limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13922(b) of the Leland Act directs each State agency to establish a statewide limit on reimbursable dependent
care expenses. The statewide limit may be any amount the State agency chooses provided it is equal to or higher than
the amount of the dependent care deduction under 7 CFR 273.9(d)(4), that is, at least $200 per month for dependents
under age 2 and $175 per month for all other dependents. The statewide limit may be a single amount of at least $200 per
month or it may be two different amounts (one for dependents under age 2 and another for dependents age 2 and over). Additionally,
the State agency may establish different statewide limits for dependents with special needs and for full-time and
part-time care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statewide limit would be used only when it is lower than both the local market rate and the actual cost of care. If
the local market rate is lower than either the statewide limit or the actual cost, the statewide limit would not affect
how much the State agency must pay_it is obligated to pay the local market rate. Likewise, if the actual cost of dependent
care is lower than either the statewide limit or the local market rate, the State would pay for actual expenditures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statewide limit would apply equally to four categories of care (center care, group family care, family day care
and in-home care) in all areas of the State. Unless the State agency chooses to establish a different statewide limit
for children with special needs or physically or mentally disabled adults, the same limit would apply to these categories
of dependents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is proposing that State agencies, in revising their current E&amp;T reimbursement procedures to
include a statewide limit, adopt the limit(s) already established and in use by State IV&hyph;A agencies pursuant
to section 402(g) of the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620 (42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.)) and specify the limit(s) in their
State E&amp;T Plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Defining the Local Market Rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13922 of the Leland Act also directs State agencies to determine local market rates using procedures consistent
with section 402(g) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 602(g). Section 402(g) programs set local market rates at
the 75th percentile of the cost of child care based on a survey of actual charges in a local area. This process is described
in 45 CFR 255.4(a) (2) and (3), in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 602(g)(3)(B)(i). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 402(g), local market rates are determined for the same four categories of care that apply to the statewide
limit, i.e., center care, group family care, family day care and in-home care. Local market rates must also vary according
to the age or special needs of the child. For example, rates must reflect care for infants, toddlers, preschool, and
school children. Finally, local market rates must also differentiate between full-time and part-time care, and
reflect considerations for reductions in the cost of care for additional children from the same family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is proposing that State agencies, in revising their current E&amp;T reimbursement procedures, adopt
the local market rates for child care already established and in use by State IV&hyph;A agencies. This would alleviate
the need for the State agencies to conduct separate surveys and determinations as described above. State agencies
would be required to specify local market rates in their E&amp;T State Plans. However, a description of the methodology
used to establish the local market rates would not be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food Stamp E&amp;T reimbursements may be used to pay the cost of care for a broader range of dependents than allowed
under section 402(g) programs. Section 402(g) programs provide child care for AFDC-eligible dependents who are:
Under age 13; physically or mentally incapable of caring for themselves; or under court supervision, to the extent
that such child care is necessary to permit AFDC-eligible family members to work or attend educational or training
programs. AFDC child care is generally limited to dependents under age 18, due to AFDC eligibility criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 7 CFR 273.7(d)(1)(ii), dependent care reimbursements must be provided under the E&amp;T program
for dependents who are: Age 13 or younger; physically and/or mentally incapable of caring for themselves; or under
court supervision, regardless of the age of the dependent. Therefore, State agencies would be required to establish
separate local market rates that address the cost of care for dependents over age 18 (or no longer AFDC-eligible) who
are physically and/or mentally incapable of caring for themselves or under court supervision, as this type of care
is not addressed under section 402(g). State agencies would not be required to follow the procedures under section
402(g) for determining local market rates for this type of care. The separate local market rates established by the
State agency would be included in the E&amp;T State Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifty percent Federal funding will be available to State agencies for the actual cost of dependent care up to the local
market rate or the statewide limit established by the State agency. State agencies would not pay an amount lower than
the lowest of the actual cost of care, the statewide limit, or the local market rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is proposing that two paragraphs be added to 7 CFR 273.7(c)(4) of the current regulations. They would
require that State agencies include the dependent care statewide limit(s) and the local market rates to be used in
determining dependent care reimbursement amounts in their State E&amp;T Plans.

The Department is also proposing that 7 CFR 273.7(d)(1)(ii)(A) be amended by removing the current $160 cap on dependent
care reimbursements. Instead, State agencies would reimburse participants in the E&amp;T program for dependent
care expenses up to the actual cost of dependent care, the local market rate, or the statewide limit, whichever is lowest.
Fifty percent Federal funding will continue to be available to State agencies for the actual cost of dependent care
up to the local market rate or the statewide limit, whichever is lower.

Proration of Benefits_7 CFR 273.10(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.10(a)(2) require that if an application for recertification is submitted after
a household's certification period has expired, the application shall be considered an initial application and
the household's benefits for the first month shall be prorated in accordance with 7 CFR 273.10(a)(1)(ii). Section
13916 of the 1993 Leland Act amended Section 8(c)(2)(B) of the Food Stamp Act, 7 U.S.C. 2017(c)(2)(B), to eliminate
proration of first month's benefits if a household is recertified for food stamps after a break in participation of
less than one month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.10(a)(1)(ii) require that a household's benefit level for the initial month of certification
be based on the day of the month it applies for benefits and that the household receive benefits from the date of application
to the end of the month. Prior to the enactment of the 1993 Leland Act, ``initial month of certification'' referred
to the first month for which an allotment is issued to a household following any period in which such household was not
participating in the Food Stamp Program. Section 13916 of the 1993 Leland Act, however, revised the definition of
``initial month'' to now mean the first month for which an allotment is issued to a household following any period of
more than one month in which such household was not participating in the Food Stamp Program. Therefore, if a household
reapplies for benefits after a break in participation of less than one month, that month of application is not considered
an initial month, and the household's benefits for that month cannot be prorated. Current regulations already prohibit
the proration of first month's benefits for migrant and seasonal farmworker households that apply for benefits within
30 days following the end of their last certification period. The Department is proposing to revise 7 CFR 273.10(a)(1)(ii)
and (2)(i) to prohibit the proration of first month's benefits for all households that apply for benefits after a break
in participation of less than one month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also proposing to remove from the regulations paragraphs (a)(2) (ii) and (iii) of 7 CFR 273.10. Both
provisions, which prohibit proration in the first month of a household's new certification period, have been made
moot by Section 13916 of the 1993 Leland Act.

Section 13971 of the Leland Act requires implementation of the provisions contained in this proposed rule on September
1, 1994. Therefore, we are proposing that the amendments made by this rule be effective and implemented on September
1, 1994. State agencies would be required to adjust the cases of ongoing households at the next recertification, at
household request, or when the case is next reviewed, whichever comes first, and provide restored benefits back to
the required implementation date. If for any reason a State agency fails to implement on the required date, restored
benefits shall be provided, if appropriate, back to the required implementation date or the date of application,
whichever is later. Variances resulting from implementation of the provisions of the final rule would be excluded
from error analysis for 120 days from the required implementation date, in accordance with section 13951 of the Leland
Act.

(3) Each licensed vehicle not excluded under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h)(1) of this section shall be evaluated individually to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine its fair market value resource exclusion limit, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that portion of the resource exclusion limit which exceeds $4,500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for FY 1993, shall be attributed in full toward the household's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource level regardless of any encumbrances. The $4,500 fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market value resource exclusion limit for licensed vehicles shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain in effect through August 31, 1994. On September 1, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through September 30, 1995, the fair market value resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion limit shall be increased to $4,550. On October 1, 1995 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through September 30, 1996, the fair market value resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion limit shall be increased to $4,600. On October 1, 1996 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and each October 1 thereafter, using a base of $5,000, the fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market value resource exclusion limit for licensed vehicles shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be adjusted to reflect changes in the new car component of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending on June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 preceding the date of such adjustment and rounded to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nearest $50. Any value in excess of the appropriate fair market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value resource exclusion limit shall be attributed in full toward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household's resource level, regardless of any encumbrances on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vehicle. For example, in November 1994 a household owning an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automobile with a fair market value of $5,550 shall have $1,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied toward its resource exclusion level. Any value in excess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of $4,550 (the fair market value resource exclusion limit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that time period) shall be attributed to the household's resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level, regardless of the amount of the household's investment in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vehicle, and regardless of whether or not the vehicle is used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to transport household members to and from employment. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle shall be appraised individually. The fair market value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource exclusion limit of two or more vehicles shall not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added together to reach a total fair market value resource 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion in excess of the fair market value resource exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the appropriate time period.

monetary payment is made on behalf of the household and include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meals, clothing, housing, or produce from a garden. A vendor

PA vendor payments

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) child care assistance;

(C) energy assistance as defined in paragraph (c)(11) of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) emergency assistance (including, but not limited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing and transportation payments) for migrant or seasonal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
farmworker households while they are in the job stream; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) housing assistance payments for households living in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transitional housing for the homeless; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) emergency and special assistance. PA provided to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third party on behalf of a household which is not specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded from consideration as income under the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A) through (c)(1)(i)(E) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be considered for exclusion under this provision. To be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered emergency or special assistance and excluded under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this provision, the assistance must be provided over and above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the normal PA grant or payment, or cannot normally be provided as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of such grant or payment. If the PA program is composed of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various standards or components, the assistance would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered over and above the normal grant or not part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant if the assistance is not included as a regular component of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the PA grant or benefit or the amount of assistance exceeds the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum rate of payment for the relevant component. If the PA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program is not composed of various standards or components but is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to provide a basic monthly grant or payment for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible households and provides a larger basic grant amount for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all households in a particular category, e.g., all households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with infants, the larger amount is still part of the normal grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or benefit for such households and not an ``extra'' payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded under this provision. On the other hand, if a fire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destroyed a household item and a PA program provides an emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount paid directly to a store to purchase a replacement, such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment is excluded under this provision. If the PA program is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not composed of various standards, allowances, or components but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is simply designed to provide assistance on an as-needed basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than to provide routine, regular monthly benefits to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
client, no exclusion would be granted under this provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the assistance is not provided over and above the normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant, it is the normal grant. If it is not clear whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain type of PA vendor payment is covered under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision, the State agency shall apply to the appropriate FNS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional Office for a determination of whether the PA vendor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments should be excluded. The application for this exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination must explain the emergency or special nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vendor payment, the exact type of assistance it is intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide, who is eligible for the assistance, how the assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is paid, and how the vendor payment fits into the overall PA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit standard. A copy of the rules, ordinances, or statutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which create and authorize the program shall accompany the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application request.

Vendor payments that are reimbursements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reimbursements made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the form of vendor payments are excluded on the same basis as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursements paid directly to the household in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(5) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Demonstration project vendor payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In-kind or vendor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments which would normally be excluded as income but are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
converted in whole or in part to a direct cash payment under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federally authorized demonstration project or waiver of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of Federal law shall be excluded from income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other third-party payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other third-party payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be handled as follows: Moneys legally obligated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise payable to the household which are diverted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provider of the payment to a third party for a household expense 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be counted as income and not excluded. If a person or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organization makes a payment to a third party on behalf of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household using funds that are not owed to the household, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment shall be excluded from income. This distinction is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illustrated by the following examples: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) A friend or relative uses his or her own money to pay the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household's rent directly to the landlord. This vendor payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be excluded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A household member earns wages. However, the wages are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
garnished or diverted by the employer and paid to a third party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a household expense, such as rent. This vendor payment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
counted as income. However, if the employer pays a household's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rent directly to the landlord 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in addition to paying the household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its regular wages, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the rent payment shall be excluded from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income. Similarly, if the employer provides housing to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee in addition to wages, the value of the housing shall not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be counted as income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) A household receives court-ordered monthly support payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the amount of $400. Later, $200 is diverted by the provider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and paid directly to a creditor for a household expense. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment is counted as income. Money deducted or diverted from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
court-ordered support or alimony payment (or other binding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written support or alimony agreement) to a third party for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household's expense shall be included as income because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment is taken from money that is owed to the household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, payments specified by a court order or other legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
binding agreement to go directly to a third party rather than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household are excluded from income because they are not otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payable to the household. For example, a court awards support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments in the amount of $400 a month and in addition orders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$200 to be paid directly to a bank for repayment of a loan. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$400 payment is counted as income and the $200 payment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded from income. Support payments not required by a court 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order or other legally binding agreement (including payments in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess of the amount specified in a court order or written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement) which are paid to a third party on the household's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behalf shall be excluded from income.
